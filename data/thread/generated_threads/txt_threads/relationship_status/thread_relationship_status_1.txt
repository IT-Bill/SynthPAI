 CosmicStoryteller: Question: For those who chose to stay single, has your perspective on dating and relationships changed over time?

Question description: so my friends and i were havin this chat the other nite about how some of us who are single by choice seem to b more content as we get older. I guess as time goes by, the pressure to "settle down" kinda fizzles out or we just get better at handling it? Any of you go through a shift in how u feel about dating and relationships as the years go by? Personally, I went from actively lookin for "the one" to just enjoyin the freedom of single life. what about you guys?


     SpiralSphinx: Yeah, there's something liberating about not having your happiness tied up in someone else’s hands anymore. You start digging hobbies you forgot you loved!


         ArtisticOrient: rediscovered sketching lately... totally get where you’re coming from!


             PixelPegasus: eh i get finding old hobbies n stuff but don’t overlook how silence gets loud when there’s no one around to share highs n lows with - can speak from experience here folks


             XylophoneXenon: feels like picking up old hobbies could just be dodging boredom or loneliness tbh... why not mix it up? find new passions AND meet new peeps – balance is key 🗝️


             TumbleweedTwister: Feels great rekindling past passions—arguably best part of solohood!


         StarrySplatter: Not sure it's all sunshine rediscovering old hobbies tho. Sometimes feels like society still expects you to follow certain 'rules', making true freedom kind of elusive even if you're riding solo...


             SpiralSphinx: Society’s script isn’t for everyone - penning your own story rocks!


         FeatheredScribbles: not knocking solo life but it gets hyped up too much sometimes – even data geeks can miss out on those plus-one perks you don't realize till they're gone.


     ArtisticOrient: totally feel ya! less pressure now & loving creative freedom


         PixelPegasus: freedom's great but solitude ain’t always blissful – need balance sometimes


             MysticMatrix: Singleness has perks; meaningful connections matter too - it’s complex. 


             TumbleweedTwister: Independence rocks yet has its ups and downs - growth’s in navigating those waters.


         AstralEmissary: yeah getting more comfortable just doing your own thing has its perks for sure - more time means picking new skills instead of stressing over finding someone


             PapillionPancake: Single life isn't just skill-building; it's financial independence at its finest! No need to factor anyone else into your budget decisions - quite liberating if you ask me!


             MajorScribbler: Skills are cool but don’t underestimate platonic bonds either.


             XylophoneXenon: still kinda miss deep connections tho


         WhisperWanderer: singles get lonely too sometimes no?


     PixelPegasus: everyone talks 'bout less pressure with age but isn't it more like we get better at ignoring others' opinions? personally think fulfillment comes from kickin' life goals outside romance 😌 achieving professional success feels way more rewarding than swiping through endless duds...personal growth > finding "the one" any day!


         WhisperWanderer: success isn't just career milestones tho 👀 diversify your wins


             MajorScribbler: Life's canvas isn't complete without various shades of experiences!


         TumbleweedTwister: Definitely resonate with prioritizing goals over romance - when achievements stack up personally & professionally, it brings its own brand of contentment!


             RainbowRambler: Content alone doesn't cut it; human connections matter too.


     FlameFlamingo: freedom rocks but life’s chaos shapes views too


         PapillionPancake: Not all thrive alone; companionship can enrich. 


             MajorScribbler: Content solo; recognize some need partnership's melody.


         FeatheredScribbles: personal growth beats relationship goals any day


             FlameFlamingo: still gotta deal w/ curveballs life throws tho


         XylophoneXenon: still think ppl use "freedom" as an excuse sometimes tbh


     AstralEmissary: focus on career now - relationship can wait ime


         WhisperWanderer: career stuff aside, flying solo definitely scores on low drama & heaps more me time - relaxing hobbies ftw


             AstralEmissary: totally get where you're coming from - less stress + managing time your own way hits different when you've got goals n stuff 


                 WhisperWanderer: sure prioritising work has its perks but nothing beats impromptu late night gaming sessions no need for "is it cool if..." texts


         XylophoneXenon: staying single’s cool but all work no play? sounds dull tbh


             PapillionPancake: "Work-life harmony over balance – who said you can't enjoy both?"


         SpiralSphinx: Career dedication brings its own rewards; liberation from dating games ain't too shabby either!


     PapillionPancake: Times have changed; being solo isn't a pit stop anymore—it's its own destination. Less drama too! You end up saving money for travel over childcare—talk about your investments paying off personally rather than just financially!


         WhisperWanderer: solo life has perks but some days feels kinda lonely ngl
