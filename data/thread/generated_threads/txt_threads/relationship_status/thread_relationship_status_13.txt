 EmeraldAlexandrite: Question: In what unexpected ways has your partner influenced your hobbies and interests?

Question description: I never imagined I'd be one for gardening until my SO basically turned our backyard into a mini botanical haven. It's weird how you start picking up bits and pieces from each other's passions. Now I'm out there more than they are, fighting snails and talking to plants lol. Got me wondering, have any of you had a similar kind of crossover with your partner's hobbies? How has it turned out for you?


     MiracleMagpie: Definitely picked up some serious cooking chops from mine! Used to think meal prep was a chore but now we‚Äôre making gourmet experiments at home‚Äîit‚Äôs our thing! Anyone else turn into an unexpected foodie?


         SaffronEmanation: tried gaming together... just ended up rage quitting üòÇ


             GrittyGiraffe: Not all co-op game nights end well! Some games test relationships more than anything else‚Äîa nice idea until your strategic planning turns into "guess why we're now silent at dinner."


             FluffyFennec: her salsa craze got me dancing too


                 MiracleMagpie: Salsa sounds fun! We tried couple yoga classes - talk about getting outta your comfort zone!


             MangoMeerkat: Board games were our sweet spot after failing at MMOs!


         RoseRider: Say goodbye lazy Saturdays! Before her magic touch, figures & data filled my downtime. Now? It‚Äôs all MTG deck-building sessions‚Äîand loving it! Who knew trading card games could beat number crunching for fun?


             FluffyFennec: bought her camera 4 fun; turned into weekend photog enthusiast!


         PolarisPioneer: Cooking at home definitely saves more than takeout!


             BlazeButterfly: Not always true! Sometimes those ingredients end up costing more!


             NebulaNavigator: yeah but don't forget time & food waste when newbies start out!üòÖ


     OmegaOtter: Never managed to share screen time together; fiance loves dramas while I crave documentaries!


         SaffronEmanation: tv tastes clashed at first but now we're tv show trivia pros lol


             BlazeButterfly: Our bookshelves tell it all ‚Äì no crossover there!


                 OmegaOtter: Kinda funny ‚Äì we've got our respective corners when it comes to TV but never resist calling dibs during game night! Guess you find harmony where you least expect!


             AmberConstellation: Shows merge? Nah, we navigate our Netflix queues solo.


             CosmicCougar: His love for cooking got me hooked!


                 OmegaOtter: Cooking sparked zero interest even after his attempts!


         SilentEmissary: We balance out - she paints, I strategize travel plans!


             MangoMeerkat: Thriving on spicy debates over politics now!


             UpliftingUnicorn: Mixing playlist genres ‚Äî classical meets techno disaster!


             FruitfulPonder: Chess met astrophotography; now we look at stars differently!


         GrittyGiraffe: Gotta admit, sometimes crossing hobby lines goes bust ‚Äì tried joining board game night despite preferring solo video gaming sessions; ended up comically confusing everyone including myself!


             CosmicCougar: Fusing interests ain't always peachy; tried mixing business discussions into our chill time once ... let's just say there was more debate than relaxation!


             FluffyFennec: took up salsa dancing once ‚Äì total disaster!


     EmeraldElephant: Tried cooking; burnt toast isn't romantic though!


         SilentEmissary: Cooking disasters - been there! But hey, practice makes perfect bites! Keep at it; even top chefs had humble beginnings...minus burnt toast hopefully? üçû‚ú®


             FeatherFlamingo: those plants got nothing on repairing gym equipment lol


             NebulaNavigator: even top designers sometimes start with wonky stitches! üòÖ


             UpliftingUnicorn: Definitely keep going ‚Äì every burnt toast leads you closer!


         BlazeButterfly: Chess obsession next level ‚Äì no queen sacs at home!


         PolarisPioneer: Rookie mistake; level-up from Burnt Toast Brigade?


             EarthyElf: Leveling up takes more than just intent! Engineers believe in precise measurements - applies to cooking too. Start simple next time; Master scrambled eggs before taking on souffl√©s! 


             CygnusCipher: Keep at it; even chefs started somewhere!


             EmeraldElephant: Definitely need levelling up! Masterchef dreams here we come?


     SaffronEmanation: must be nice lol but got dragged into cycling with mine and honestly? never again. we're sticking to separate hobbies from now on üòÇ


         BlazeButterfly: Tried cooking together once - now just order takeout instead!


             MangoMeerkat: Board games became our thing - competitive UNO nights are epic!


             EarthyElf: Partner tried getting me into her yoga routine ‚Äì quickly realized my idea of stretching does not involve twisting like pretzels every morning! We now respectfully decline each other‚Äôs "relaxing" hobbies.


             CygnusCipher: Board games became our thing after just one game night invite!


         RainbowChameleon: Turned our kitchen into fusion food experiments ‚Äì Travel through taste!


             BlazeButterfly: Tried mixing up cuisines at home once too ‚Äì resulted in more disasters than deliciousness! Props to those with culinary magic but think some should just appreciate other‚Äôs cooking rather than wreak havoc on dinner!


         UpliftingUnicorn: Interesting take! Tried merging movie nights into one mega-genre fest ‚Äì thought we'd interrupt less, instead film critique debates sparked. A shared hobby? Maybe not quite... üçø


             FluffyFennec: debates might seem rough but they spice up the relationship imo ‚Äì disagreeing over movies beats bland conversations any day! keeps things interesting tbh


     SilentEmissary: Totally picked up photography after countless travel snaps by my wife!


         NebulaNavigator: got hooked on sketching cuz bae loves doodling!


         RainbowChameleon: Started watching history docs coz of my spouse ‚Äî now our cozy nights are all about bizarre past events!


         UpliftingUnicorn: Tried out salsa dancing after seeing how much joy it brought them - surprise bonus workout! Now we're regulars at local dance nights; never thought rhythm could be found at two left feet territory!
