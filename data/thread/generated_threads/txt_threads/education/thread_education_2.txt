 GiddyGator: Question: If your degree had a "real-world" survival rating, what would it be?

Question description: okay hear me out, i was watching some post-apocalyptic movie last night (ya know the type where everything goes kaboom and there's like 1 savvy person who knows how to fix a radio or smthn) and i started thinking... if things really hit the fan, how useful would our degrees actually be? like i studied physics and sometimes wonder how much of it would help me or anyone else if we suddenly had to, idk, start from scratch? sure, understanding the fundamental laws of nature is cool and all, but can it help me grow a potato or fix a generator? would love to hear your takes on this and if there's something you learned during your studies that could come in handy when the unlikely dystopian future becomes today's problem.


     AstuteOracle: Astronomy might not seem immediately useful post-collapse (no aliens at our rescue), but think navigation by stars and understanding time cycles ‚Äì pretty handy sans Google Maps! Plus that problem-solving mindset? Gold when tech support‚Äôs gone rogue üòÖ


         GracefulGazelle: Literature might not teach us farming or engineering, yet critical analysis hones strategic thinking‚Äîessential when reinventing society from rubble!


             RainRaccoon: Resourcefulness trumps all when rebartering society‚Äôs terms!


                 AstuteOracle: Astronomers' knack for innovative thinking complements raw resourcefulness!


             ArcticMirage: economics = organizing scarce resources, basically apocalypse CEO material üíº


                 GracefulGazelle: Economics factors more than resources; it taps into psychology, which holds merit when you're piecing back human interactions amidst chaos!


             QuaintQuokka: coding teaches logic - still gold when there‚Äôs zero tech support


                 GracefulGazelle: Logical frameworks aren't exclusive to code ‚Äì surviving chaos needs vigilance plus adaptability learned through dissecting narratives. 


         RainbowChameleon: Survival isn‚Äôt just scavenging ‚Äì rebuilding society needs history too! Got any legal disputes? Ancient Roman law incoming! Plus, knowing past collapses gives us clues not to repeat them ‚Äì kinda like civilization‚Äôs troubleshooting guide.


             PixelPegasus: cooking skills would trump all - everyone needs to eat!


                 MajorScribbler: "Cultures survive on more than just food!"


             RainRaccoon: Don't underestimate logistics! Even post-crisis we'll need folks who can manage scarce resources efficiently‚Äîbarter systems don‚Äôt run themselves!


                 SheerLuminary: enviro skills would be prime for growing food & clean water hacks!


             SquigglyCurls: Engineering's core ‚Äì we're rebuilding from ruins up!


                 AstuteOracle: Sure engineers rebuild stuff but let's not forget who'll navigate those rebuilt ships or synch up newly constructed clocks! All skill sets dock at usable ports when society hits reset. 


         FeatheredScribbles: so data science isn't exactly making fire from sticks but hey, crunching numbers helps manage scarce resources efficiently right? always gotta find those optimal solutions ‚Äì apocalypse budget edition!


             SheerLuminary: nah tbh i think knowing which plants are gonna kill you vs feed you could win over number crunching when there's no supermarkets left... just saying üåø


                 FeatheredScribbles: sure plant wisdom's vital but rationing out those berries equally matters too!


             RainbowChameleon: Gotta say, understanding past civilizations could give insights on rebuilding society! Think crafting laws or barter systems ‚Äì history's kind of like humanity‚Äôs user manual when technology taps out!


     MelodicRaven: Critical thinking trumps specific skill sets any day!


         StarlightSalamander: History helps us avoid past disasters - pretty useful post-apocalypse!


             RainbowChameleon: Knowing which crops failed historically? Priceless for future farm planning!


                 ArcticMirage: econ might sound useful but let‚Äôs be real‚Äîit's not gonna teach you how to purify water or fend off raiders. book smarts ain't everything when it comes down surviving out there.


                 FlameFlamingo: doubt i‚Äôd be scorsese useful unless we‚Äôre talkin' morale-boosting apocalypse screenings...


             PristinePegasus: nursing skills are clutch post-disaster - wound care and disease prevention save lives


                 MelodicRaven: Education builds resilience - broader than just hands-on skills!


                     PristinePegasus: know-how plus cool head equals survivor material


                 StarlightSalamander: Yet medicines run out; knowledge doesn't.


             MelodicRaven: Totally get history's value but think mix-and-match skills would ace survival!


         FantasticallyFlora: Haha, let's just say between epidemiology and sanitation management classes, if we're avoiding zombie outbreaks or need clean water strategies after civilization goes belly up? Count me covered!


             FroggyFestival: visual arts might seem useless post-apocalypse but hey still need creativity right? imagine designing camo patterns while everyone else plays rambo - we'd add color to whatever bunker we're hiding out üé®üí™


                 VivaciousSpright: system analysis? basically i'd be your go-to guy for putting together some makeshift comms network from scrap electronics... you never know when you'll need an old-school walkie-talkie setup!


                 SheerLuminary: naw man enviro sciences would totally be clutch ‚Äì think clean energy & crop rotations!


                 EnergeticEagle: Post-collapse? Celestial navigation essentials could steer society anew!


             ObliviousMetropolis: Got to say as someone who‚Äôs no stranger to scalpels outside movies ‚Äì medicine skills are pretty apocalypse-proof. From stitching up wounds without modern equipment to identifying which plants might just save you from an infection - it‚Äôs hands-on survival 101!


                 FantasticallyFlora: Absolutely essential! Pairing those medical chops with disease prevention strategies - we'd make a solid team post-apocalypse!


                 VivaciousSpright: def into scrappy tech scavenging & jury-rigging solutions when SHTF


                 EnergeticEagle: Astrophysical insight - navigating by stars could trump GPS tech!


             ArtisticOrient: nice theory but ever tried making clothes from scratch? not easy!


                 MelodicRaven: Textbook knowledge evolves into problem-solving post-crisis!


         ArtisticOrient: critical thinking‚Äôs great until you need actual hands-on skills ‚Äì can't eat thoughts or wear ideas, just saying ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è


             RainbowRambler: Debugging society's code sounds pretty handy post-apocalypse!


     StarlightSalamander: It might seem like knowing ancient emperors won't help with immediate food shortages or building shelters ‚Äì yet understanding societal collapse and recovery throughout history provides key strategies that go beyond day-to-day surviving into thriving! üèõÔ∏è


         FroggyFestival: not gonna lie, some times i think all these ancient collapse stories might help understand failure but won‚Äôt fix broken stuff or grow food... cool for long term sure but short term? give me a multitool any day over marcus aurelius' meditations üõ†Ô∏è


             StarlightSalamander: Legacies more than stories ‚Äì they're warnings; Marcus might not fix a radio but would help sidestep failed leadership pitfalls when rebuilding society from scratch!


             RainRaccoon: Practical biz skills - Like bartering - become crucial fast.


             DaintyDolphin: aint just about growing potatoes tho ain't we gotta figure out new societies as well? intl relations might actually help set rules when starting from scratch


         ObliviousMetropolis: Medicine translates into survival; disease doesn't wait for society‚Äôs reboot. 


             SquigglyCurls: Building stuff up again takes more than duct tape and hope - solid structures don't design themselves! Engineering skills are like gold post-collapse.


             DaintyDolphin: intl relations might help reestablish order quickly üëÄ


                 ObliviousMetropolis: Rebuilding society needs healthy individuals as much as organized governance - meds and diplomacy should walk hand-in-hand post-collapse!


             EnergeticEagle: Astrophysics teaches critical thinking ‚Äì invaluable during societal resets. 


         ShadowPirate: market skills could be clutch - trading's always gonna be key!


             ArcticMirage: supply and demand won‚Äôt matter if we can't even produce anything lol


             SquigglyCurls: Structures stand before trade - priorities!


     MysticMatrix: Psychology degree underrated - we're social creatures after all!


         AstralEmissary: commerce might seem boring but post-apocalypse we'll still trade ‚Äì someone‚Äôs gotta manage those bottle caps right? supply chain basics ain‚Äôt glamorous but totally useful when rebuilding markets from scratch


             ArtisticOrient: Fashion's frivolous until u need morale boosts & identity üòâ


             SquigglyCurls: Post-collapse? Building expertise equals essential shelters first!


             VivaciousSpright: system analysis? more like apocalypse gold lol gotta figure out efficient ways to reboot civilization right? plus trading coding for goods could work cuz let‚Äôs face it everything‚Äôs gonna need fixing eventually


         TumbleweedTwister: Laws still matter when rebuilding society.


             FlameFlamingo: so if i'm stuck after like world-end level stuff... not great tbh üòÇ. but hey, people gonna need entertainment right? plus i'd be ace at documenting whatever new society comes outta that mess!


                 TumbleweedTwister: Documentaries might need copyright lawyers too!


                     FlameFlamingo: who bothers with copyrights when there's no internet to stream?


             FeatheredScribbles: data skills would help ration supplies efficiently!


             ArcticMirage: every crumbling empire needed an economist to save their budget so don't knock econ just yet‚Äîit might just keep your future distopia from going totally broke!


         RainRaccoon: Strategic thinking ain't obsolete either!


             EnergeticEagle: Theorems don‚Äôt fill stomachs, yet they spark innovation.


                 MysticMatrix: Innovations thrive on group dynamics too!


             MysticMatrix: Gotta say though, navigating group dynamics becomes crucial when reestablishing communities - not just surviving solo!


             ShadowPirate: don‚Äôt underestimate communication skills - crucial even post-collapse!


     AmberConstellation: Feeling like an MBA might not cut it when machetes are more useful than market analysis out there! But wait up ‚Äì negotiating could still be clutch for trading resources or forming alliances when things get wild, no?


         WhisperWanderer: not sure how git commits gonna help w/o electricity tbh... but hey we're experts at debugging stuff right.. so rigging up some tech scrap into something useful might just work out üëÄ devs are basically wizards sans magic when you think abt it


             ArcticMirage: economics might come handy tho for post-apoc trade systems tbh


             FlameFlamingo: film studies... ghost town creds mean i can scout cool movie set locations? but yeah only hope would be if people needed distraction - then boom, impromptu cinema from abandoned cars or something.


             GracefulGazelle: Literary smarts won't plant crops directly but think manuals creation or preserving oral history! Culture matters too. 


         ShadowPirate: lol having flashbacks from all those group projects during uni...but real talk - being able to market anything you find as 'must-have' could make you kingpin when everyone's scrounging around üòÇ gotta say though brainstorming catchy slogans ain‚Äôt much help if can't grow food or start fires straight up


             VivaciousSpright: ever try debugging code when society collapses? trust me systems analysis won't be your saving grace either...unless we're counting inventory? or finally putting those excel shortcut keys into apocalypse use - ctrl+s our lives anyone?


                 AmberConstellation: Survival mode could make those PowerPoint skills handy ‚Äì imagine convincing tribes with killer presentations!


             ObliviousMetropolis: Might not trade sutures for seeds often, but when push comes to shove in those chaotic times? Suddenly everyone wants Doc on speed dial!


             ArtisticOrient: design flair might just trade well for those 'shiny' post-apocalypse essentials!


         StarrySplatter: Code-slingers would rule by reprogramming leftover tech! #HackerLife


             AstralEmissary: commerce basics will still run the show when you gotta trade stuff even if tech works
