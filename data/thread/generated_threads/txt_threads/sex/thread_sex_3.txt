 GracefulGazelle: Question: How has your gender influenced your career or education choices?

Question description: Was scrolling through some old college pics and remembered the time I almost switched my major because of a silly belief that I wouldn't 'fit in' due to my gender. Ended up sticking to my guns and here I am, years later, happy with my choice but I keep wondering... do others have similar tales? Did you pursue or avoid a certain path because of gender norms? Or maybe were encouraged to take a leap despite them? Would love to hear how your experiences unfolded.


     CometCuckoo: nursing seemed like the only option back then cuz 'it's a woman's job', doubted it first but stuck with it. love helping people now so guess things work out sometimes. anyone else took up jobs cuz of stereotypes?


         ArcticMirage: nah mate, choosing careers just cuz society says so seems nuts! didn't let stereotypes box me in ‚Äì gotta chase what makes sense for you...even if tuition fees kinda do that for us anyway üòí


             VivaciousSpright: no way i was gonna let old-school thinking dictate my path - dived into coding even though folks were all 'isn't that just for geeks?' joke's on them now ‚Äòcause turns out geeks are cool ‚úåÔ∏èplus coding pays the bills without having finished uni which ain‚Äôt cheap anyway


             GiddyGator: Pressures are real. Picked physics despite pushback‚Äîpassion wins but reality bites too.


                 ArcticMirage: physics sounds ace ‚Äì props for sticking it out!


                     GiddyGator: Cheers! It wasn't easy for sure‚Äîgotta thrive where your heart‚Äôs at though. Here‚Äôs to defying norms and crushing goals!


                 VioletVeil: studied architecture, never boxed by norms - rewarding af


                 FantasticallyFlora: Irony - stereotyping while challenging stereotypes? 


             DaintyDolphin: def didn't let clich√©s steer me either ‚Äì still broke tho lol


         MajorScribbler: Felt no pressure choosing art history; it transcends gender norms.


             PixelPegasus: chef here, industry's tough but shattered some serious glass ceilings!


                 SquigglyCurls: Broke molds too; engineering‚Äôs not just men‚Äôs work!


                 MelodicRaven: Overcame similar odds; eternally glad for staying true to myself!


                 VivaciousSpright: tech's got its issues but honestly saw more outdated computers than outdated stereotypes at uni - picking your path should smash those old-school molds any day.


             FantasticallyFlora: Chose public health when it wasn‚Äôt common for folks like me; never regretted it. Follow passion over stereotypes always!


             ArtisticOrient: fashion always felt right; stereotypes weren't stopping me


         PixelPegasus: yeah but lemme say not every industry welcomes women equally sometimes gotta fight tooth n nail just do prove you're more than some kitchen novices clich√© even if that‚Äôs where you end up excelling pretty ironic huh


             DaintyDolphin: irony hits hard when you're killing it where they stereotype


             WhisperWanderer: tech's another tough nut where dudes dominate but honestly never felt pushed away cuz of it sorta just ignored expectations & coded my way through maybe i got lucky tho coz i hear stuff gets intense for others who break norms


             ArtisticOrient: had moments doubting if design was too clich√© for girls but creativity doesn‚Äôt box you in like that; sometimes ya just dazzle em with sheer talent üòâ


     XylophoneXenon: studying design didn't really feel like a "gendered" choice


         MysticMatrix: Subconscious biases can sneak up on us! 


             FroggyFestival: yeah hidden biases can influence us more than we think


                 XylophoneXenon: not always so cut n dry imo


                 RainbowChameleon: History shows evolving professional gender norms.


                 QuaintQuokka: was discouraged but coded anyway


             RainRaccoon: Reflecting on decades in business leadership roles definitely had its moments where status quo expectations based on gender were evident. Working diligently was key‚Äînot just to excel but sometimes simply to fit into those boardrooms!


                 GiddyGator: Challenging those boardroom norms sounds tough! But hey, physics doesn‚Äôt care who you are ‚Äì just your sweat equity. Always odd looks at first sight but delivering results speaks volumes... No free passes here either!


                 CherryBlossomBandit: chef here... never felt boxed by "gender roles" so just followed passion for food ‚Äì kitchen doesn‚Äôt care if you're homem ou mulher; only cares if u can cook üî•üî™ gotta break taboos one dish at a time!


             EnergeticEagle: Fascinating perspectives here! In academia especially within sciences there's often an unspoken expectation of following certain streams seemingly more suited for different genders despite appearances to contrary.


                 XylophoneXenon: yeah seems more about personal interest than anything else


                     MysticMatrix: Spot-on regarding personal passions driving choices! Yet let‚Äôs not overlook society shaping those ‚Äòinterests‚Äô we assume are free from cultural pressures, often more than we realize.


         WhisperWanderer: always thought coding was just cool for anyone


             StarrySplatter: Funny how back in uni days some folks thought game dev was more of a 'guy thing'. Never bought into it - programming‚Äôs got no room for old school stereotypes. Plus, here everyone just cares if your code works!


             PristinePegasus: nursing seemed natural here but pushed past old stereotypes too


             FeatheredScribbles: data science defies 'boys club' myths but stigma persists sometimes


         CherryBlossomBandit: In cooking too‚Äìgender doesn‚Äôt dictate skill.


             FluffyFennec: never felt pressure on the creative path - ideas don‚Äôt have genders


             EnergeticEagle: Astrophysics once skewed male; now diversity's expanding horizons. 


     CosmicCougar: hindsight's always 20/20 - glad i chose my path


         SheerLuminary: enviro science wasn't exactly welcoming either


             MelodicRaven: It's crucial we continue challenging these outdated barriers together!


                 QuaintQuokka: gender expectations are such an archaic way of picking careers imo - never let 'em sway me & happy i followed my interests instead üë©‚Äçüíª


                 SquigglySquid: it was all trades or farming for us blokes back then - different times for sure 


             RainbowChameleon: Never faced barriers; museums seem historically pretty inclusive here actually.


                 QuaintQuokka: yeah well tech ain't all rainbows either


                 StarrySplatter: Definitely fewer obstacles as a dude in tech.


             RainbowRambler: Can relate - computer science wasn't exactly balanced on day one either! But tapping keys felt right from get-go; coding doesn't care who you are as long as it compiles!


                 WhisperWanderer: felt outta place at first too, still made it happen though


                 CherryBlossomBandit: Career's more than stereotypes. 


                 ArtisticOrient: fashion design's def seen as more 'femme' but let me tell you - that doesn't make things easier! still gotta fight for your spot under those runway lights, proving creativity ain‚Äôt got no barriers üé® gotta hustle whatever field you‚Äôre passionate about!


         FeatheredScribbles: kinda wish more ignored those stereotypes tbh


             DaintyDolphin: systems won't change just cuz we want them to


             FantasticallyFlora: Stereotypes? More like speed bumps. Pushed past 'em; never happier. 


             CosmicCougar: nothing beats carving your own way


         PapillionPancake: Defied odds; never looked back!


             RainbowChameleon: Passion trumps stereotypes every time.


                 RainRaccoon: Sometimes luck steers the ship.


             FantasticallyFlora: Public Health wasn't always women-friendly; feels good changing tides!


             TumbleweedTwister: Never really thought twice about picking law despite any norms; passion overrode stereotypes for me. Just dived into books head-first!


     SheerLuminary: honestly think my field chose me more than i chose it - always been obsessed with nature regardless of the guy/girl ratio at uni. there‚Äôs room for everyone if you ask me, just gotta weather through those stereotypes sometimes lol


         MysticMatrix: Definitely feel you there! Fell into psych cause it fascinated me per se‚Äînot just 'cause more gals were around at school. Interest beats stereotype any day!


             ObliviousMetropolis: Passion for medicine trumped any stereotypes‚Äîcareer satisfaction over conformity every time!


                 PristinePegasus: always thought nursing was more than just being 'the caring female'. it‚Äôs tough out here sometimes‚Äîsticking through those shifts takes more grit than people give credit for regardless of gender norms!


                 FluffyFennec: got into graphic design 'cause it's where my creativity flows best - never really thought twice if it was typical for dudes, though sometimes clients seem surprised üòÖ just find your thing and rock it!


                     ObliviousMetropolis: Surprise factor fades; competence shines regardless of niche clientele presumptions. 


                 RainRaccoon: Business admin - interest led me here irrespective of norms!


                     ObliviousMetropolis: Career joy isn't tied to your chromosomes!


             SquigglySquid: back in my day things were different but passion always came first


                 FlameFlamingo: film's been a huge part of me forever & never really thought about whether it was a 'guy thing' while getting into editing - just went for it because i love telling stories through cuts and frames.


                 ArcticMirage: picked economics 'cause numbers make sense to me more than stereotypes


                 FroggyFestival: art ftw regardless of old school norm bs


             FroggyFestival: gender norms didn't guide me - art did üé®


         RainbowRambler: Navigated similar biases in tech‚Äîstayed true to code love!


             WhisperWanderer: tech geek since forever despite all cliches


             ArcticMirage: passion doesn't really care about gender huh


                 RainbowRambler: It's all binary under the hood - logic over labels. 


             SquigglyCurls: Stood firm too‚Äîbrigdes over bias!


         SquigglySquid: back when i was deciding what next after school, trades were pretty much the go-to for blokes. wasn‚Äôt too fussed myself ‚Äì ended up where life took me rather than chasing any dream gig!


             ShadowPirate: got pushed towards marketing - "better fit" apparently, didn't buy it


             PristinePegasus: culture here does push certain jobs depending on if you're male or female but nursing felt right for me despite that pressure - folks need care everywhere after all


             RainbowChameleon: Picked history‚Äîpassion over stereotypes!
