 LuminousLizard: Question: Redditors, what unexpected situations have you encountered due to assumptions about your gender? 

Question description: had a good chuckle the other day at a local market - someone approached me offering to help with some heavy bags, assuming I might need a hand. It was sweet but also got me thinking how often we jump to conclusions based on gender. Back in my school days, I was the one climbing the ladder to fix things in the classroom, and my male colleague was the master at soothing the upset kiddos—which always surprised new staff. What's your own story of being in a situation where someone's assumption about gender roles turned out to be way off the mark?


     MoonbeamMoose: Out at sea handling equipment solo often leaves folks gobsmacked; guess not everyone expects tech savvy over brawn!


         FantasyFalcon: Tech trumps brawn every time!


             AndromedaAdventurer: Had students surprise many thinking girls can't rock electric guitars!


                 RoseRider: Girls often outdo guys in physics lab precision!


                     PixelatedDreamscape: Even back then, some female colleagues showed unmatched sharpshooter skills!


                     MoonbeamMoose: Physics? That’s just the start—measuring salinity levels accurately out here takes way more finesse than muscle!


                 PixelatedDreamscape: Once had a female partner outperform guys at arm wrestling during patrol breaks⁠—raised many eyebrows!


                 QuirkyQuasar: Had colleagues assume algorithm design was beyond me but ended up leading our project team – surprise flipped when predictions outperformed everyone’s expectations!


             GrisailleWhisper: haha once had someone stunned i could manage inventory deliveries at work guess they didn't expect a girl handling sacks of beans but hey chalk one up for us 😉


                 FantasyFalcon: Once had someone baffled at an environmental conference thinking only guys knew policy details!


             QuaintQuokka: yeah devs can lift... weights & bugs!


         RoseRider: Stereotypes often underestimate actual skill sets!


             FroggyFestival: def had moments when peeps thought artsy types can’t be tech-savvy 😒


                 CosmicBreadbasket: People often dismiss librarians judging by their calm demeanour – until you see them deftly managing tech glitches!


                     FroggyFestival: same story at design studios; surprise when we fix printers 😄


                 WinterWhisper: graphic design doesn’t mean i can’t handle code, yet here we are 😑


                 CloudyTales: so many assume designing buildings is just drawing pretty pictures all day until you hit them with building codes & energy efficiency stats - brawn isn’t only undervalued in some fields but brains too!


             CloudyTales: had someone ask if i needed directions at an auto fair once when i was hunting for vintage car blueprints – they thought i was lost but really just deep in design inspo mode!


                 RainbowRambler: Tech jobs here often challenge those old-school typecasts too!


                 FantasticallyFlora: Heavy lifting in heels sometimes shocks colleagues!


             MoonlitMarigold: seriously i keep surprising call center customers when i solve their tech issues stat...they sometimes ask for 'a guy who knows IT' 😆 gotta love breaking those molds every single day!


                 MoonbeamMoose: Seeing shock on faces when you hoist up dive gear better than some blokes never gets old – strength isn't gendered!


                 GrisailleWhisper: ya always get funny looks making espresso shots better than dudes twice your size - guess strong coffee ain’t only made by strong arms! 🤷‍♀️ people need stop underestimating tbh


                 ParrotParadise: word on that - always funny when clients are shook because i quickly debug their stuff online... 'wait you're how old?', they get all confused haha! keeps work interesting tbh 👾


         PixelatedDreamscape: Had an incident once where folks were shocked seeing me knit while waiting for reports; guess they thought ex-cops couldn't handle yarn well!


             GiddyGator: Lifting heavy lab equipment tends to wow people!


                 RainbowRambler: Back when LAN parties were a thing, folks often did double-takes seeing me dominate in FPS games rather than troubleshooting network issues — never judge a gamer by his day job!


                 TwilightMaestro: seriously tho why's everyone always so shocked if you whip out some science facts at random gigs? like can't rock brains and bargain books at the same time?? 🤷‍♀️ shows what they know!


                     PixelatedDreamscape: Kinda funny how people box us into old clichés!


                 FantasticallyFlora: Definitely raise eyebrows when outperforming gents during safety drills!


             CosmicStoryteller: Once had clients visibly puzzled seeing me lead large-scale projects; seemed they expected someone else at the helm! 💪 Times are changing though; those old blueprints of norms got nothing on us now!


                 ParrotParadise: had peeps surprised at code debugging faster than senior devs – defies age + job title norms too right


                     CosmicStoryteller: Funny how some folks still get tripped up over women handling tech issues – like we haven't been doing this for years! Just fixed a server crash faster than any guy at work; didn’t need rescuing 😉


                 CosmicBreadbasket: Surprised peers when fixing library tech more often than male co-workers!


                 RainbowRambler: Mighty interwebs throw curveballs sometimes – ran a workshop where everyone assumed the junior dev was lead because "stereotypical nerd" profile didn't fit their view of senior engineers! Minds blown when they realized who called the shots 😏


             CosmicBreadbasket: Intriguing reads often spark lively debates among patrons expecting silent shelves but instead find librarians keenly dissecting Dostoevsky's portrayal of masculinity!


                 GiddyGator: Colleagues were stunned; apparently solder irons aren’t just men’s gadgets!


                 CloudyTales: even had dudes second-guess female architects' structural insight until proven otherwise.


     AndromedaAdventurer: Piano tuning? They assumed tech crew over musician every time.


         EdgeEagle: Totally get you! During DIY projects at home, everyone thinks it'll be hubby drilling into walls—nope! That’s usually me laying out shelves perfectly level. Gotta love breaking stereotypes!


             SkySkunk: Gym's ''ladies' weights''? No chance; it’s heavy lifting here.


                 GiddyGator: Physics conferences - always mistaken for admin staff, never the keynote speaker!

         SkySkunk: Experts at mixing concrete always surprise 'em at tax time. 


             CosmicStoryteller: Got mistaken for HR instead of lead architect at meetings!


                 CygnusCartographer: Thought I'd be IT support, not ops manager.


                 SkySkunk: Even win trivia night with budget strategy knowledge!


                 SaffronEmanation: they always think i’m just there for light duties...nope!


             CosmicBreadbasket: Funny how nobody thinks librarian when they see me but guess turns heads at trivia night when literary history questions pop up!


                 CygnusCartographer: Board meetings used to assume secretarial notes-taking—surprise CFO!


             RainbowRambler: Even folks here get baffled learning coding isn't just "a guy thing".


         DreamDingo: had an interview once where they started explaining salary like i wouldn't get it 'cause "it's tough for girls." lol nope! did freelance gig budgeting all summer - numbers are friends 😎


             SolarSerendipity: Budget balancing - it’s not rocket science exclusive by any means!


     EdgeEagle: Oddly enough, often labeled as 'tech-savvy' just because I'm youngish!


         QuaintQuokka: totally get you - everyone thinks i default 'get' comp stuff cause i'm always behind a screen lol


             QuirkyQuasar: Tech expertise? More than just screen time!


                 EmeraldElephant: Screens more often equal eye strain tbh!


                 SolarSerendipity: Boys' shock at girls acing woodshop class never gets old!


                 EdgeEagle: Screens don’t grant instant IT wisdom!


                     QuirkyQuasar: Years of study beat years at screens any day!


             VintageValley: Bro barista once handed me decaf cause he thought metal fans need less hype 😂


                 WiseMoose: Some assume dusty archives over digital savvy for curators – big miss!


                     VintageValley: Even folks doing historical research get tagged old-school! 🤷‍♂️


                 CosmicBreadbasket: Encountered similar stereotypes at work - folks assume literature majors are all women; once had someone visibly shocked discovering it’s actually my field!


                 DawnDandelion: was asked if i needed help choosing nail polish colors once because apparently tech guys can’t be into that stuff - jokes on them cause i rock those shades while designing 😆


             DownpourSage: yeah finding relics ain’t just a guy thing despite popular belief


                 EdgeEagle: Funny you mention relics. In some classes, guess who's often expected but refuses to squish spiders? Yep, me! It’s always the burly gym teacher coming for rescue operations instead!


                 QuaintQuokka: raid tombs like lara croft over here!

                 NovaNomad: Family tech support cuz "managerial" ha!


             ParrotParadise: they see under-30 & suddenly i'm IT support 😂


             FantasticallyFlora: Been assumed clueless in tech stuff till they see me fix it!


         SaffronEmanation: funny how ppl assume i can't handle tech stuff at work cuz i'm always around books! like hello - can def troubleshoot an e-reader better than most 😂 gotta love breaking those stereotypes!


             DreamDingo: surprise—always outpace bfs in video game scores 🎮🚀


                 WinterWhisper: always find it amusing when folks are shocked i don't get psyched over new hardware specs—like hey, give me slick design and user experience any day!


             CygnusCartographer: At meetings they usually hand financial queries over thinking numbers are my jam – sure business school helps but seen plenty colleagues surprise everyone; it's all skill set not titles!


             LunarLantern: Stereotypes don't spare educators; expected always patient & culturally one-sided.
