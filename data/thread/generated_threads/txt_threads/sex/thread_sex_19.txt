 AdorableAardvark: Question: How has your perception of gender roles changed as you've matured?

Question description: Back in the day, it felt like there were super strict rules on what it meant to "be a man" or "be a woman", but times are changing and so did my view. Funny thing is, it took some quirky hobbies and a bunch of years to realize that. Picked up knitting recently - yep, you heard that right - and it's been a blast and a big eye-opener. No one batted an eye, which was cool and really different from the old days. Made me wonder how others have seen these roles evolve over time, and what's your story? Did you break any "gender rule" that you're particularly proud of?


     GrisailleWhisper: hardcore disagree on nobody batting an eye tbh


         NoodleNightingale: i'm calling bs - where you are definitely shapes those reactions! stockholm might not care but try pulling out knitting needles elsewhere... good luck!


             ProsperousCadenza: Definitely depends! Some folks here still raise eyebrows...


                 ShimmyShake: can confirm - even just dying your hair an offbeat color gets you weird looks at uni sometimes...guess not all places are open-minded yet


                     TaurusTraveler: From experience here... yeah, certain choices turn heads - more so among older generations though!


                 HuckleberryHarmony: Interestingly enough ‚Äî not just your location influences reactions but generational changes! Attitudes are shifting gradually yet retired buddies around here sometimes still cling to old school beliefs when they see unconventional choices by younger gents. 


                 SheerLuminary: yeah def sees old school vibes in some spots still


             JovialJay: True - sentiments definitely aren't universal; seen plenty vary too much.


                 TerrificTurtle: here across various cities? still stereotypes but guess we‚Äôre inchin' forward just slowly


                 DoodlesDolphin: Got into baking pastries ‚Äì definitely see some looks when sharing recipes at work! It just shows such perceptions are still alive, just subtler here up north.


                 HuckleberryHarmony: Definitely regional‚ÄîMadrid‚Äôs another world entirely!


             FieryPheonix: Sure feels like open-mindedness isn't evenly distributed‚Äîsame goes for different spots back home too! What flies in one city could raise eyebrows elsewhere! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è


                 MoonbeamMoose: Totally get you! My dive team has all sorts keen on "untypical" hobbies too.


                 CuteCentaur: Hardly surprising that geography dictates social norms‚Äîhistory has countless examples such as dress codes once challenging propriety now celebrated in art galleries!


                 MellowMandrill: times change but old habits die hard ‚Äì seen plenty skeptical glances when crossing these invisible lines


         ProsperousCadenza: Things have definitely shifted; even seeing dudes at salsa classes now - something you'd never expect years back! But still depends on where you are; some places might give side-eye for less 'traditional' hobbies.


             VermillionVulture: Seen similar shifts here; progress feels real!


                 EdgeEagle: So true! In schools nowadays, we see more fluidity too ‚Äì boys rocking home ec classes like champs while girls crush it in science clubs! Times are indeed changing; breaking old molds feels kinda refreshing!


                 CosmicCuttlefish: Saw mixed reactions at local dance workshops too!


                 SheerLuminary: totally see what you mean! just took up surfing myself which used to be such a dude-dominated thing and honestly? nobody cares anymore who hits the waves - pretty stoked about how chill everyone is these days


             MoonbeamMoose: Caught being both at sea and academia pretty much sets you off the beaten 'gender track'. Witnessed plenty changes; colleagues growing past old biases makes tough days brighter!


                 RoseRider: Noticed similar shifts at conferences; diversity's refreshing!


                 CosmicBreadbasket: Progress isn't uniform; old notions lurk even under new norms. 


                     ProsperousCadenza: Yet many old-school mindsets still clutch onto legacy 'rules'.


                 SummerSolstice: arts scene here isn't much different sadly üòí


             MangoMeerkat: Still taboo in countless circles here!


                 CherryBlossomBandit: feel ya! cooking used to be 'a mulher' thing but here i am cheffing up storms daily & loving every second! times change üòå


         QuaintQuokka: noticed less traditional hobby stereotypes lately


             JovialJay: Sometimes cultural pockets still hold onto outdated stigmas; biking as eco-transport over here raised eyebrows initially when it clashed with expected norms - now it‚Äôs common sight!


                 CuteCentaur: The bike anecdote hits close to home- even amongst educated circles there still lingers an air for 'appropriateness'. Not long ago a colleague eyebrow-raised over women leading certain academic departments; some preconceptions take generations to fade away.


                 DuskDancer: man even here people used to give weird looks seeing dudes doing yoga at the beach but now it's just normal - def shows progress!


                     JovialJay: More common now, but full acceptance? Still biking uphill culturally speaking. 


                 AzureAlchemy: Eco-trends shape today's ‚Äònorms‚Äô surprisingly quick!


             ParrotParadise: def noticed a mixup in hobby choices around town


                 CherryBlossomBandit: Kitchen's brutal sometimes, had folks surprised seeing me bake brigaderios after running grill stations like crazy. Cooking crosses those old lines every day ‚Äì it‚Äôs just art you eat instead of hang up!


                     QuaintQuokka: yeah feels like those 'gendered hobbies' walls are crumbling everywhere! i see coding workshops more diverse than ever - everyone just geeking out together regardless of anything else üßë‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíª


                     ParrotParadise: seen guys ace at embroidery here too, it's all skills over stereotypes now


                 ZephyrZebra: Financial freedom reshapes "acceptable" hobbies too.


                 DoodlesDolphin: Crafty gents weaving baskets at our local market now!


             ZephyrZebra: Totally see this more at work too!


                 HuckleberryHarmony: Knitting's cool! Progress visible but biases linger. 


                 CuteCentaur: It's fascinating to observe shifts happen firsthand; universities once had ironclad lecture styles now incorporate engaging social media too ‚Äì conventions are truly bending.


                 OptimalOctopus: Still catching bias flare-ups behind 'progressive' facades here. 


         TaurusTraveler: Every culture different - some folks might surprise you!


             FieryPheonix: Even progressive circles can clutch onto old stereotypes sometimes. 


                 FantasyFalcon: Encountered some raised eyebrows when advocating mixed panels at environment conferences - diversity's still making waves even where you'd expect open minds!


                 DuskDancer: always thought footie was just for guys until my wife schooled me at beach soccer lol


             CosmicCuttlefish: Knitting clubs here - guys joining too!


                 VegaVisionary: Noticed something similar with dance classes‚Äîtraditionally female-dominated, now quite mixed. Real progress feels like no hobby comes with a blueprint for who 'should' join anymore. Love it!


                 CherryBlossomBandit: Yeah! Cooking's all genders territory here too. 


             DigitalPixie: Not so fast‚Äîwhere I'm from beat old stereotypes still going strong!


                 MangoMeerkat: Old clich√©s die hard but cracks are definitely showing!


     NoodleNightingale: cool hobby! societies changing but still pressure imo


         VermillionVulture: Def noticed more diversity at planning conferences now!


             DuskDancer: even gym culture's less 'bro' nowadays which is cool


                 SiriusSoothsayer: Flexibility beats old traditions every time!


                 CuteCentaur: Gender studies courses now ‚Äì more inclusive dialogues than ever before. 


                 MellowMandrill: used to drive buses full house men only hard thinking back


             JovialJay: Interesting points! At work events lately there's been more inclusive vibes too - not just ticking boxes but actual change. Still room for improvement but definitely heading away from those dusty old manuals on ‚Äòproper conduct‚Äô.


             EdgeEagle: Seen big shifts in class too! Girls excel in science and boys love art ‚Äì breaking stereotypes left & right. Gives me hope for our future generations feeling less pigeonholed by outdated norms!


         FieryPheonix: Definitely feels like work culture is catching up too! As a consultant ‚Äî typically boys' club territory ‚Äî seeing more women take charge nowadays shows those old 'rules' fading fast! It's empowering really; echoes your point about hobbies like knitting getting destigmatized. Progress rocks! 


             MoonbeamMoose: Totally see these changes underwater too; locker room talk's now conservation chat!


                 CosmicBreadbasket: Shifts visible indeed; underlying biases linger subtly though. 


                 CherryBlossomBandit: kitchens also less macho agora!


                 AndromedaArtist: still far off real equality tho


             WinterWarlock: retirement = more ladies delivering mail now than ever before!


                 NoodleNightingale: postal work maybe, other fields not so much


                 GiddyGator: Seems like we're all noticing shifts! In physics research ‚Äî traditionally male-dominated ‚Äî there‚Äôs definitely more diversity these days. It blurs those old lines even further, which is super refreshing. 


             GiddyGator: Research fields see similar trends - more diversity now!


                 NoodleNightingale: still rare tho where i am


                 VegaVisionary: Even high-level science sees stereotypes crumbling fast!


         StarlitSage: Sure we've come forward, but there are still old-school expectations around careers where some think twice before stepping outside those lines ‚Äì speaking from observing many across diverse schooling environments! 


             SummerSolstice: art's cool like that, no boxes


                 ParrotParadise: still get weird looks when i talk coding with non-tech peeps though


                 CosmicCuttlefish: Saw quite a shift at local markets where traditionally female-dominated trades now see men leading sales‚Äîand vice versa! Talk about squaring away stereotypes!


                 FireflyFlirt: Progress? Though artsy types get breaks maybe!


             FireflyFlirt: Totally spot-on, careers weirdly still stuck in past times here!


                 CosmicCuttlefish: Ran some empowerment workshops recently where we mixed up 'traditional' skills ‚Äì guys actually loved learning beadwork! Breaking barriers starts small but man, does it catch on quick!


                 AzureAlchemy: Saw few ladies uptake high-level educational positions back then!


             OptimalOctopus: Hospitality's smashed some serious old-school "service" stereotypes! Feels empowering. 


                 StarlitSage: Education's getting there - slowly breaking moulds!


                 DigitalPixie: Definitely seeing more fluidity these days - rocked nail polish during pre-drill meetings and guess what? Not a single eye roll caught here. Times are changing for sure!


                 CherryBlossomBandit: Kitchens nowadays mix it up quite well - lotsa talent wearing aprons regardless of gender! Flavor doesn't discriminate; neither should we üòåüç≥


     FunkyForce: Seeing more male nurses and female surgeons lately - stereotypes are fading fast!


         QuaintQuokka: tech's definitely mixing things up!


             StarlitSage: Still pressure on boys‚Äô academic choices; arts vs sciences debate lingers. 


                 WinterWarlock: arts need more love imho - creativity‚Äôs ageless!


                 FunkyForce: True on schooling biases - it‚Äôs vital we encourage kids based on interests/passions rather than dated norms! Seen both wonders & woes where folks pursue mismatched careers 'cause of "shoulds."


                 SpiralSphinx: Financial industry shifting too; diversity in leadership now more common. 


             DoodlesDolphin: Totally spot-on about tech! It's reshaping workplace dynamics big time. Back when starting out in city management - definitely a male-dominated field back then - had female mentors who were trailblazers against norms. Seeing more women lead now feels like evidence we're steering away from those old biases finally sticking less each day. 


                 SummerSolstice: arts scene's shaking up old norms too - more dudes embracing roles trad thought 'feminine' & vice versa


                 SiriusSoothsayer: Seeing similar shifts in architectural firms too!


                 DigitalPixie: Geology's getting there too - mixed crews now common!


             HuckleberryHarmony: Definitely slower shifts back home; still fewer female orthopedic surgeons than you‚Äôd expect!


                 FunkyForce: In progress but super slow here!


                 DigitalPixie: Even rocks can't resist change; seeing more diversity out there!


         SiriusSoothsayer: Switched out hard hats for client meetings now‚Äîa lot more variety at the table design-wise‚Äîand skill-wise! Times sure are changing behind those blueprints too.


             VegaVisionary: PhD labs are less "boys' club" now!


             RoseRider: Ever notice job ads? 'Dynamic' often means young; 'experienced', older men maybe? Labels sneak into professions subtly but hang on tight!


         FantasyFalcon: Workplace diversity thrives - even more so amongst green jobs!


             RoseRider: Lots more women tackling physics these days - old barriers crumbling!


                 VegaVisionary: Chemistry departments seeing similar shifts!


                 CosmicBreadbasket: Literary heroes often defy conventions ‚Äì think Zhenya Lukashin!


             CosmicBreadbasket: Yet traditional mindsets persist obstinately in some academic circles. 


             ShimmyShake: not sure where you're looking but pretty sure those "green jobs" aren't smashing any ceilings here - some folks just swap out one stereotype for another tbh
