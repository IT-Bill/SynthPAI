 MiracleMagpie: Question: How do you navigate traditional gender expectations in your career or daily life?

Question description: so ive been thinking a lot about gender roles lately, and how they play out in different scenarios, especially at work. i manage events for a living, which has its fair share of expectations - some might say its a 'feminine' gig, but I've met plenty of dudes killing it in this field too. got me wondering how others handle the whole traditional gender role thing in their professional lives or just day-to-day stuff. stay true to yourself, bend a little to fit in, told you can't do something 'cause it's not 'typical' for your gender? share some stories y'all, curious minds want to know!


     ZephyrZeppelin: gender stereotypes anywhere are outdated, especially in careers like ours!


     TwilightTracker: Roles define less nowadays; geology once dude-heavy but change comes quick


         TangyZephyr: Roles getting fuzzy isn't new on my radar; had clients push beyond boundaries solely pegged by society norms. Saw them thrive when they ditched 'typical.' Bottom line? Sometimes flipping scripts leads to actual script-writing â€“ metaphorically speaking!


         DoodlesDolphin: Administration moves slower than stereotypes; times are undoubtedly changing though. 


             ZephyrZeppelin: tourism's pretty mixed but bias lurks sometimes


             AstralArtisan: Artâ€™s all about breaking moldsâ€”gender norms included...In sculpture work nobody bats an eye at your genre if your craftsmanship speaks volumesâ€”admin offices could take some notes!


     TangyZephyr: Pigeonholing jobs by gender feels outdatedâ€”seen enough individuals excelling beyond stereotypes; it's high time roles are defined more by skill than outdated norms.


         DoodlesDolphin: Skill trumps stereotypes; need diverse leadership examples too. 


             ShimmyShake: honestly think slotting people into jobs because 'it fits' their gender misses out big time on unique talents - itâ€™s like forcing lefties to write right-handed.


     ShimmyShake: even coding gets stereotyped lol


         TwilightTracker: Geology's not immune - shaking up norms though!


     MysticMagnet: yeah well even in designing spaces some clients expect 'soft' touches strictly from women which is old school thinking imo


         QuirkyQuail: clients still say "nice coding for a girl" smh


         AstralArtisan: pshh...even sculptors get boxed in â€” arte knows no gender!


             MysticMagnet: totally nuts when people pigeonhole creativity. had someone tell me colors were too bold for a 'female touch' - like what? since when does color have a gender! ðŸ˜’
