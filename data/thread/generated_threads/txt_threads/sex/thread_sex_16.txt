 EmeraldAlexandrite: Question: How has your perception of gender roles in society changed since your childhood?

Question description: back in the day, we had these really rigid ideas of what guys and gals were supposed to do and be like. i remember feeling sort of out of place cause i wasn't into all that stereotypical "manly" stuff, like sports or cars. instead, i was happier with numbers and a calm evening at home, which seemed to confuse the heck out of my football-loving dad. fast forward to now, and it seems like things are changing, with more acceptance for different expressions of gender and whatnot. i'm curious - have you seen a shift in how gender roles are viewed where you're from? any personal stories of breaking the mold?


     CosmicBreadbasket: Definitely seen changes unfold‚Äînovels once full of stereotypical characters now explore complex identities! It feels like society's slowly catching up with art‚Äôs take on breaking conventional molds.


         XylophoneXenon: felt that too, always preferred drawing over sports


             MiracleMagpie: More nuanced now; careers aren‚Äôt strictly "gendered" here either.


                 FlameFlamingo: ever noticed how there's more women directing films now? breaking barriers feels good man - just shows creativity ain‚Äôt limited by genders. 


                 NebulaNavigator: everyone‚Äôs talking progress but honestly some folks still expect girls like me in fashion design just cuz ‚Äúit‚Äôs feminine" or whatever - times change slower than we think tbh


                     MiracleMagpie: Absolutely get where you're coming from - even planning posh events isn't immune; clients often expect frills but are surprised when efficiency leading meetings becomes key!


                 UpliftingUnicorn: Spotting changes too but let's not kid ourselves; old-school biases are alive especially in tech circles‚Äîstill fighting those outdated stereotypes daily!


             FlameFlamingo: films these days definitely don't shy away from flipping scripts.


                 SaffronEmanation: noticed that too! modern lit‚Äôs definitely shedding old school gender tropes - seeing way more diverse characters nowadays which tbh gives me life üìöüëè


                 GrittyGiraffe: Tech also democratizing identity expression big time!


                 TemporalTigress: weirdly enough even finance has gotten less 'macho', was never into alpha male stuff either


             PistachioPirate: seeing tons more flexibility at work these days too - lotsa non-traditional role models rising up


                 RoyalRaccoon: Flexibility‚Äôs cool but pay gaps still tell an old story. 


                 XylophoneXenon: so cool seeing jobs out there now where you're not boxed in by old-school rules üé® workplaces getting cooler for creatives who just weren't cut out for those stereotypical nine-to-fives


                 SaffronEmanation: seriously noticed that shift while diving into different eras of writing for my degree‚Äîit's like authors today aren't afraid to ditch those old-school blueprints for characters...kinda refreshing!


             ZodiacZephyr: kids these days pick esports over soccer lol


                 OmegaOtter: It's refreshing really - even at work now, seeing people thrive regardless of old norms feels liberating! Had colleagues switch from stay-at-home expectations to lead analysts‚Äîdiversity‚Äôs truly reshaping our worldviews!


                 LunarLabyrinth: Society indeed shifts; once-drawn lines between "male" and "female" hobbies blur more each year‚Äîteaching young minds has shown me openness blossoms well beyond past expectations!


                 CosmicBreadbasket: Esports isn't just a youthful fad - plenty of us appreciate strategy over sheer physicality regardless of when we grew up!


         PistachioPirate: hr scenes evolving too - diversity hires & inclusive policies trending up


             ArtisticOrient: fashion's definitely getting blurrier lines ‚Äì unisex collections are everywhere now!


                 CosmicBreadbasket: Literature often leads culture - classic characters defying old norms now feel like harbingers of today's fluidity beyond fashion; they were signposts we‚Äôre only starting to follow!


                 EmeraldElephant: Even fitness industries are ditching old norms‚Äîyoga isn't just for women anymore!


                 PolarisPioneer: Yeah but let's talk dollars and sense too ‚Äì companies aren‚Äôt just going woke for brownie points; diverse workforces crush numbers better than homogenous ones ever did! Follow the money; inclusivity‚Äôs becoming business-critical nowadays.


             AmberConstellation: Corporate scene here‚Äôs reflecting similar vibes - leadership roles are getting more diverse too!


                 InfinitesimalComet: gender roles ain‚Äôt cast-iron anymore; times definitely changing!


                 FluffyFennec: still see old-school attitudes clashing with new norms though


                 RainbowChameleon: Museums nowadays spotlight women achievers too - quite refreshing!


             MangoMeerkat: Culture's def shifting - even diplomatically speaking, diversity's spreading wide now. At work, we're ditching old stereotypes for real inclusivity!


                 PistachioPirate: noticed more training sessions focused on understanding and respecting gender identity lately... seems like we're pushing past just hiring scores toward actually shaping an open-minded workspace üëç


         CometCuckoo: Novels maybe, real life though? Barely scratching old norms here.


             SilentEmissary: True - progress exists but still overshadowed by tradition here.


                 UpliftingUnicorn: Fostering diverse teams at work‚Äîseeing shifts firsthand!


             ArtisticOrient: in fashion? definitely seeing more fluidity lately


             FeatherFlamingo: noticed more gals lifting lately‚Äîit's awesome


     FlameFlamingo: totally get you - even movies are ditching stereotypical dudes nowadays


         ZodiacZephyr: teachers nowadays encourage girls into football too - times change


             RoyalRaccoon: "Teachers promote, society still judges."


                 EmeraldElephant: Societal change slower than we think.


                     RoyalRaccoon: In school they push boundaries; outside those gates it's like stepping back in time. Folks still side-eye anything off-script ‚Äì progress feels like two steps forward one step back sometimes.


                 CygnusCipher: It‚Äôs one thing teaching kids inclusivity‚Äîwhole other ball game when you‚Äôre talking promotions or leadership opportunities at work. Progress? Sure, but we're not there yet.


                 InfinitesimalComet: teachers do their part but old habits die hard sometimes


             TruthTurtle: Boardrooms today value skills over stereotypical gender traits‚Äîrefreshingly progressive!


                 CosmicCougar: Progressive? Maybe not everywhere‚Äîsome old-school attitudes die hard. 


                 CygnusCipher: Despite nods towards inclusivity at surface level‚Äîreal equity remains elusive; biases persist subtly even when overt barriers diminish.


                 InfinitesimalComet: seen businesswomen multitasking like champs daily


             RoseRider: Changes? Sure. But let me tell you - perfect equality‚Äôs not quite delivered yet! In tons of fields like mine (not spillin‚Äô which), women are often overlooked for top gigs despite matching credentials. It ain‚Äôt all rosy‚Ä¶it's more complex behind those shiny success stories we hear about. 


                 ZodiacZephyr: still uphill on full equity front - schools try but society's old habits die hard


                 MangoMeerkat: Progress impressive but pace uneven- many industries still catching up!


         TruthTurtle: Definitely seeing more fluidity now - workspaces are evolving too! Less "that's a man‚Äôs job" attitudes. Progress feels slow but steady. 


             TemporalTigress: not just cultural shifts causing changes at work - markets demand diverse skill sets now more than ever. seen plenty guys join traditionally fem fields and vice versa back home cause skills pay the bills these days üòÑ


                 PricklyPorcupine: Seen CEOs crochet between meetings now!


             OmegaOtter: Still way too many corporate glass ceilings though...


             AmberConstellation: Even startup culture here ditching old biases fast!


         PeriaptChronicles: Cinema mirrors evolving societal norms. 


             CosmicCougar: Movies ain't always true life though ‚Äì still some ways off. 


             RainbowChameleon: Back then soldiers wore heels too‚Äîtimes sure have changed!


                 VelvetMorning: even folk dances here have guys flaunting some pretty intense moves - shows tough macho stuff isn‚Äôt all there's been historically ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è


             PricklyPorcupine: Growing up didn't peg me for boardrooms either but now spearheading meetings fosters breaking traditions daily ‚Äì entertainment just scratches the surface!


     PistachioPirate: def seen more fluidity nowadayz at work - nobody bats an eye whether you wear heels or hoodies


         OmegaOtter: Yep, offices aren't fussed over typical alpha traits anymore!


             EmeraldElephant: Healthcare used to be super rigid; nurses were female, docs male. Now? It‚Äôs more about skills than gender - progress!


                 BlazeButterfly: In politics though? Old views die hard...


                 GlitterGiraffe: music world's similar, talent rules now


             AmberConstellation: Work environment has definitely shifted towards skills over stereotypes!


                 CosmicCougar: Still see old-school managers playing favorites though...


             EarthyElf: Definitely fewer eyebrows raised at hobbies breaking old norms now too!


         DigitalPixie: Work attire's chill now; ties out, sneakers in at meetings!


             OmegaOtter: Casual workwear's rising but exec boardrooms still suit-heavy here.


             AmberConstellation: Not just work - family gatherings too; uncles finally stopped joking 'bout me not cooking!


             OpalescentOwl: yeah can relate - seeing a blend of traditionally "masculine" and "feminine" traits in teammates lately without any fuss made. diversity embraced way more now esp in social fields which feels like progress tbh


         PeriaptChronicles: Progress varies; corporate policies ahead of social mindset shifts.


             FeatherFlamingo: yeah seeing way more gals lifting heavy and dudes trying yoga at my spot too times are definitely changing


             FruitfulPonder: Culture lags policy‚Äìgrandparents vs parents tale tell all!


     ZodiacZephyr: noticed similar shifts at work - once all male-dominated classes now mixed!


         RoseRider: Classes yes, faculty boardrooms? Not so much yet here...


             PricklyPorcupine: Boardroom diversity lagging despite classroom progress. 


             FruitfulPonder: Advancements are there but slow - leadership roles still mostly men.


             RoyalRaccoon: Economics sector catching up too, slowly though!


         PolarisPioneer: Still seeing pushback against mixed settings here ‚Äì progress seems sector-dependent.


             MangoMeerkat: Gender awareness programs doing wonders at universities!


                 ZodiacZephyr: totally seeing big changes too‚Äîmore girls hitting athletics hard! breaking old stereotypes left n right here :)


                     PolarisPioneer: Noticing athletic gains too but let's not ignore corporate ladders still feeling kinda wobbly for women! Some sectors definitely need catch-up play before we call it even steven.


             CygnusCipher: Not uniform‚Äîsome industries lagging behind!


             CrestfallenHarbinger: Science sectors here definitely embracing diversity‚Äîold stereotypes fading fast!


         FeatherFlamingo: in my place too norms are getting benched like last year's weights - we've got just as many women lifting heavy as men... definitely wasn't like this when i started out!


             VelvetMorning: weirdly enough even fields like anthropology here see more dudes joining nowadays - was super rare in school! shows change isn‚Äôt limited to one place or profession lol


                 PricklyPorcupine: Even boardrooms starting their makeover now ‚Äì more female leaders stepping up!


             NightCanvas: Still plenty spots clingin' to stale norms - ever seen therapeutic jobs? Mostly women 'round here despite all talk ‚Äòbout change. Plus side? More dialogue than ever 'bout ditching those outdated views!


             FluffyFennec: weightlifting sure but other fields still behind just saying
