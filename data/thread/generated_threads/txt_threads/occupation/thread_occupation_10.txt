 JovialJay: Question: What's an unexpected way your job has changed your daily habits or lifestyle?

Question description: So, here's a funny story. My job has me focussing a lot on sustainability, right? The other day I instinctively started lecturing my barista on the benefits of compostable cups! Embarrassing, I know, but it got me thinking... has anyone else found that their profession has started to seep into their daily life in unexpected ways? Whether it's the lingo you use, the way you think about problems, or even the coffee you drink ‚Äì what are some ways your job has played a part in reshaping your routine or habits?


     NebulousNimbus: funny that because now i'm always automating mundane stuff at home too... if i can script it, why do it manually? cuts down chore time so i can binge-watch another series lol


         CloudberryPromise: automation's cool but let‚Äôs not forget power savings ‚Äì any chance you're optimizing energy consumption too?


             AstuteOracle: That reminds me, got into tracking celestial events using smart alerts ‚Äì never miss another meteor shower! Plus it nudges eco-friendly behavior since you start valuing clear skies more... stargazing FTW!


         SparkSprite: Leave work at work; domestic life isn't automated!


             TadpoleTango: not sure i buy that "leave work at work" thing - law thinking seeps into everything i do; even when talking budgets at home feels like negotiating a contract!


         AdorableAardvark: Haha! For me it‚Äôs all about risk assessment - checking weather forecasts isn‚Äôt just for fieldwork anymore! Even planning family outings turns into analyzing potential rain delays‚Ä¶ Can‚Äôt shake that habit off! 


     CloudberryPromise: totally relate - i can't help but analyze every product for its eco-friendliness now! aisle shopping turned into me giving impromptu lectures to unsuspecting friends üòÇ just part of being in tune with mother earth i guess!


     AuroraArmadillo: Ironically found myself subtly incorporating anthropological observations during mundane errands!


     AstuteOracle: Stargazing really tunes you into caring about our tiny blue dot - found myself low-key obsessed with saving energy at home!


         AdorableAardvark: Seismic risks enforce disciplined emergency prep at home!


             QuirkyQuail: pretty sure i've become an unintentional clutter-free minimalist coz of work xd


             ColorCascade: Sounds regimented‚Äîlike agile living applied domestically!


             NebulousNimbus: getting into drills at work means now i catch myself running mental debug scenarios over my morning coffee instead of actually relaxing üòÇ kind of trades one stress for another huh?


             AmberConstellation: Funny enough, budget forecasts at work made me weirdly good at managing household expenses! Who knew spreadsheets could come in handy beyond office hours?


         CloudberryPromise: pretty sure it's our day jobs shaping habits more than anything else - starry skies might inspire but those 9-to-5 eco goals? they stick with you!


             AstuteOracle: Yep‚Äîand don't forget those hobbies turn eco-habits too!


         QuirkyQuail: totally get that - since working part-time and dealing with algorithms all day i catch myself optimizing literally everything at home too! like can we find the shortest path to clean those dishes? üòÇ comp sci brain just doesn‚Äôt switch off lol


             TadpoleTango: lawyer here - can't look at any document now without spotting loopholes... even restaurant menus aren't safe! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
