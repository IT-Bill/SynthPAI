 EmeraldAlexandrite: Question: For those behind the numbers, what's the wackiest expense you've ever seen in someone's accounts?

Question description: So here's the thing - diving into spreadsheets and financial statements can be as dry as a good Savanna, but every now and then, you hit upon something that makes you do a double-take. I remember sifting through a client's expenses when I came across a hefty sum dropped on... wait for it... an emu farm. Yep, right there between the printer cartridges and the company retreat, there was this fledgling (pun intended) investment in flightless birds. Got me wondering if someone out there's got an ostrich to match my emu! What‚Äôs the strangest line item you‚Äôve ever spotted on the job? Or if you‚Äôre not balancing books for a living, ever had an eyebrow-raising expense of your own that your accountant questioned?
