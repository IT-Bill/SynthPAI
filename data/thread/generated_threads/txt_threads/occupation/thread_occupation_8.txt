 EmeraldAlexandrite: Question: What are some unexpected ways your job has shaped your personal life or habits?

Question description: So I crunch numbers for a living, which means I’ve unknowingly become that guy who mentally tallies the cost of everything, even when off the clock. Started out kinda as a joke, but now I find myself budgeting my weekend plans on the back of a napkin – my friends think it’s hilarious, and my partner just rolls her eyes. But hey, it’s not all bad... I guess I've picked up some killer budgeting tricks along the way. Does your job sneak into your personal life? Like, do you find yourself accidentally in 'work mode' at random times?
