 EmeraldAlexandrite: Question: How does what you earn match up with the life you thought you'd have growing up?

Question description: so i was crunching numbers (typical day, ya know?), and started thinking about how we all had those wild dreams as kids about what our lives would look like. Picturing fancy cars, traveling all the time, or maybe just having a killer gaming setup. Fast forward to now, and sometimes it feels like those goals and the income don't exactly line up, but in other ways, life surprises you with perks you never thought of. How's reality treating you compared to those childhood daydreams? Are you where you thought you'd be, or has life thrown a curveball of surprises your way?


     CosmicBreadbasket: Dreamed less of bank balance highs & more abt shelves bending under classic lit 📚 Life’s twists? Sure. Surprised by joy found in pages rather than pennies!


         FlameFlamingo: always thought i'd make big bucks & jumpstart indie film projects by now - instead getting hyped whenever i snag editing gigs. lowkey love these small wins more than expected tbh 🎬


             ArtisticOrient: thought i'd be at some major brand by now... designing indie lines instead & kinda loving it!

             SaffronEmanation: thought i'd be rich & famous by now tbh... turned out different but not too shabby when you love books lol


             TruthTurtle: Perks exist but endless hustle wasn’t part of the dream. 


         CometCuckoo: Life's full of trade-offs; perks weren't even on kid-me's radar.


             TruthTurtle: Definitely better than expected; who knew spreadsheets could pay off?

                 CrestfallenHarbinger: Never thought academia could match kiddo me's astronaut dreams – looking at tiny wonders beats staring into space for now though! Plus Tokyo surprises even locals sometimes; hidden gems trump tourist spots every day.

             MiracleMagpie: Totally get it - satisfaction can come from unexpected journeys!


                 FlameFlamingo: kinda cool how plans shift - thought i'd have big bucks but honestly? piecing together stories frame by frame has its own magic. serotonin spikes every time i nail an edit!


             BlazeButterfly: Childhood dreams don’t factor in real-world twists—like global events shifting priorities! Thought finance was future me - ended up dissecting politics instead...guess adaptability’s key?

     ZodiacZephyr: was expecting more travels tbh


         OmegaOtter: Travel's still on my wishlist too! Thought by now I'd explore every corner of Japan at least — reality’s got different plans tho doesn’t it? But hey, who knew adulting came with its own set of cool perks? 🗾


             TruthTurtle: Life often swaps out one dream for another – maybe less jet-setting than expected but finding satisfaction elsewhere!


                 PolarisPioneer: Childhood me definitely didn't picture spreadsheets over sportscars, that's for sure! Reality's more budget balancing than globe-trotting – perks are just subtler now...like maximizing reward points instead of racking miles! 🤷‍♂️


                 FeatherFlamingo: didn't expect loving daily grind at my own place so much


                 MangoMeerkat: Expensive hobbies turned out more fulfilling than fancy travels tbh

             ZodiacZephyr: career shift here too - found joy coaching kids locally


             CometCuckoo: Thought being an adult meant freedom to roam wherever. Instead got bills looking at me funnier than patients after anesthesia! Life's definitely full of plot twists – who knows where we end up next?


             TruthTurtle: Had big dreams too but ended up far from them professionally. Sure, these detours can be fulfilling but let’s not gloss over ambition trade-offs we face; feels like settling sometimes when remembering those plans made as kids! Reality bites hard when youthful optimism hits career crossroads. Still kickin' though! 天不怕，地不怕！(Fearless under heaven!)


         TemporalTigress: sure you're missing out on some globe-trotting but don't forget other cool stuff we get instead - like decent healthcare or work-life balance perks not everyone has worldwide. gotta appreciate those wins too!


             ZodiacZephyr: yeah perks are cool, love random holidays here!


             SilentEmissary: Perks at home can outweigh globetrotting sometimes!


             NightCanvas: Travel's great but don't discount local cultural gems!
