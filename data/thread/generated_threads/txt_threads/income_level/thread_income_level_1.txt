 CosmicStoryteller: Question: For those who've 'made it' financially in your field, how have your relationships changed with friends and family?

Question description: they say that when you start doing really well for yourself, the dynamics around you can shift. i never thought it'd be a 'thing' until I noticed subtle differences in how some friends behave now that I've reached a certain comfy spot professionally. like, some are super supportive but others, well, let's just say, the vibes can sometimes feel kinda off, you know? anyone else feel like they have to navigate new waters with personal relationships after hitting some success milestones in their careers?


     SpiralSphinx: Those lunches weren't just 'catch-ups' anymore; suddenly became like Shark Tank episodes where everyone's pitching passive investments - gotta love when your wallet becomes more interesting than you!


         ShadowPirate: kinda sad when real talk takes a backseat cause 'success' shows up - priorities shift & suddenly old jokes don't land ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


             ObliviousMetropolis: Success definitely tests relationship authencity ‚Äì spotted that too.


             MelodicRaven: Not everyone starts seeing dollar signs; some bonds just grow stronger.


             MysticMatrix: It‚Äôs eye-opening when you realize there's an unspoken tax for getting ahead; even casual hangouts aren't immune from becoming transactional. Seen it happen‚Äîyou're suddenly more bank than buddy in their eyes.


                 ShadowPirate: noticed even solid mates get weirdly competitive instead of happy for ya - like everyone‚Äôs life turned into some race nobody agreed running üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí® kinda missed memo when chill hangouts became leaderboard checks...


         VioletVeil: guess people forget money isn't everything üôÑ 


             FeatheredScribbles: funny seeing which mates stick around for pints versus those now after a 'small loan'. lends truth to that saying ‚Äòmo money, mo problems‚Äô doesn‚Äôt it? gotta dodge those dollar signs üôÑ


             MajorScribbler: Real connections outvalue cash; true friends get that too.


         EnergeticEagle: Seeing family suddenly itemize their needs whenever you're around ‚Äî like you've become some kind of walking ATM ‚Äî really shifts perspectives on kinship lines.


             PapillionPancake: Start hitting those finance milestones and boom ‚Äì suddenly everyone's your 'long-lost' cousin twice removed needing cash advice or a "small" loan. Family gatherings feel more like networking events lately!


             SpiralSphinx: Holidays morphed into unofficial Kickstarter campaigns after hit a few career homers‚Äîgotta admire their creativity though!


     ShadowPirate: money changes people or just exposes them?


         VioletVeil: honestly think cash just highlights who was fake all along - those are real tests of friendship even over here.artist? architect? doesn't matter - true colors will show eventually when success hits.


             PapillionPancake: Seen plenty where cash magnified certain... quirks‚Äî generosity bloomed or stinginess flared up. 


                 GiddyGator: Money sure acts like a friendship magnifying glass!


             RainbowRambler: Not just cash; ambition can strain friendships too - tricky balance!


             MajorScribbler: Success tests bonds; share passions, stay real with pals!


         RainRaccoon: Seen both sides - Money magnifies personalities more than anything else!


             EnergeticEagle: Wealth often reveals underlying insecurities and can strain friendships; observed plenty among colleagues post-promotions.


                 RainRaccoon: Social gatherings sure feel different when you're picking up tabs!


             FeatheredScribbles: totally see it - bank balance goes brrr & personalities go boom!


             FantasticallyFlora: Often it's existing tensions getting spotlighted than changed dynamics.


                 ShadowPirate: success could just skew your own lens too


                 RainRaccoon: Spotlight doesn't fabricate flaws, it just intensifies them.


         SquigglyCurls: Reveals more than changes.


             StarlightSalamander: Folks show true colors when situations change ‚Äì sure ‚Äì but don't dismiss adaptation as exposure alone; some evolve alongside your 'milestones'.


             AmberConstellation: Totally exposes true colors IMHO - seen friendships get reaaal weird.


     VioletVeil: not sure everyone‚Äôs acting all weird just cause you're doing well - sometimes folks are just dealing with their own stuff y'know? can't assume everyone‚Äôs motives are linked to your success tbh.


         GiddyGator: Definitely see odd vibes sometimes! Maybe they‚Äôre just thirsty for a round of Wei√übier on me? üçª


             RainbowRambler: Sometimes it's just unspoken expectations vs reality.


         RainbowRambler: Sometimes it‚Äôs jealousy masked as indifference; been there.


         StarrySplatter: Perceptions warp when you're climbing up too; works both ways. 


     RainRaccoon: Personal dynamics are tricky beasts; slight shifts often go unnoticed initially. Found out over time who sticks around for you versus your wallet - eye-opening but valuable lessons learned. 


         SquigglyCurls: Money exposes people‚Äôs true colors ‚Äì learnt that hard!


         MysticMatrix: It's fascinating but not surprising that people react differently when you're up vs down financially. True connections aren‚Äôt swayed by your bank balance; they‚Äôre rare but worth their weight in gold when compared to fair-weather friendships illuminated by success. 


     EnergeticEagle: Success often invites unwarranted scrutiny disguised as concern. 


         PapillionPancake: Yeah noticed too, some mates back off like crabs at a beach party - not just eyeballing your wallet but feeling small next to it maybe? Personal growth can mean growing apart sadly.


             SquigglyCurls: Not just pockets deepening, sometimes characters shallow out too. 


             VioletVeil: not all mates turn weird tho.


             GiddyGator: Sometimes it‚Äôs less jealousy - more like our paths just diverge naturally over time. 


         StarrySplatter: Notice who offers congrats without prompting. 


             EnergeticEagle: Genuine enthusiasm rarely wears a mask.


                 StarrySplatter: Watch out for suddenly close acquaintances too. 


         ObliviousMetropolis: Friends' expectations definitely escalate subtly.


             TumbleweedTwister: Noticed too - generosity suddenly stings some pals.


             StarrySplatter: Not all can handle your growth; some cheers are just echoes. 


             FantasticallyFlora: Sometimes 'success' alters who sticks around for the long haul.
