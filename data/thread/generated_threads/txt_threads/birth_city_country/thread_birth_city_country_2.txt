##### Thread topic "birth_city_country" no.2 #####


 SquigglySquid: Question: Redditors who've witnessed their hometown become 'famous' or 'infamous', what's your story, and how do you feel about it? 

Question description: Have you ever thought about how the place you were born can kind of shape your identity, even if tangentially? For instance, I've seen the city I was born in become quite well-known over time for its urban regeneration and a couple of natural phenomena, and it's so odd to see tourists snapping pics where I used to just walk my dog. Kind of makes me proud, but also a little protective, y'know? Like, that's my stomping ground you‚Äôre all Instagramming! How about you lot? Does anyone else feel a certain way when their sleepy little spot or even a bustling hometown hits the headlines or travel brochures? Share those tales!


     FeatheredScribbles: i miss when it wasn't so crowded tbh


         CosmicCougar: traffic jams every weekend now... ridiculous!


             EnergeticEagle: Not just weekends, even weekdays feel saturated now; growing cities everywhere face similar fates it seems.


                 PristinePegasus: feels like everyone's flocking here lately... kinda overwhelming tbh


                 XylophoneXenon: managing day-to-day stuff has turned into planning around off-peak hours with all these folks flockin' over üòë adaptability level up!


                 ArcticMirage: rent sky-high cause everyone's moving here lately...kinda miss old times


                     EnergeticEagle: Explosive urbanisation isn't kind‚Äîhousing woes just tip the iceberg here!


             PapillionPancake: Gotta say though, amid all that chaos - some local spots are thriving now which probably would've folded otherwise!


                 VioletVeil: locals barely recognize their own streets anymore


                     PapillionPancake: Tourist dollars help sure - but there‚Äôs something bitter when 'local' shifts meaning overnight...


                 SpiralSphinx: Pros outweigh cons IMO - city vibe's livelier now!


             AmberConstellation: Local spots now just selfie backdrops. üòî


         CherryBlossomBandit: understand where you're coming from... big cities getting attention definitely changes things up - rents go up, old hangouts can get too touristy... nostalgia for those low-key days hits hard sometimes üòî but cool seeing your own place appreciated worldwide too right? gotta take good w/ bad i guess


             FantasticallyFlora: Urban growth‚Äôs double-edged sword - bittersweet developments!


                 ArcticMirage: feels weird seeing familiar spots turn into insta backdrops üòÖ


                 SpiralSphinx: It's kinda like watching your kid grow up ‚Äì proud of the progress but missing those quiet moments together before they hit every milestone known to social media.


                 SheerLuminary: more people means more pollution tbh just saying


             EnergeticEagle: Cities evolve like galaxies‚Äîfinding quiet corners mitigates yearning for past simplicity. 


                 RainbowRambler: Urban evolution's bitter-sweet symphony.


                 StarrySplatter: Rising rent‚Äôs like hard mode irl ‚Äì love/hate speedrun material!


                 VivaciousSpright: rapid expansion masks community spirit...kinda sad actually


             PapillionPancake: Growth perks are great until your fav caf√© gets jam-packed!


                 VivaciousSpright: honestly kinda ruins it for locals when small gems blow up - stuff gets generic real fast plus good luck finding anywhere chill without bumpin elbows nowadays


                 StarrySplatter: Overdevelopment can tank your whole vibe - not everyone wants their chill space turned into another level for tourist speedrunning. Remember when you could actually hear yourself think at that cafe? Good times...


                 ArtisticOrient: tourist money's nice but RIP authentic vibe üò©


         FantasticallyFlora: Totally get you - nostalgia mixed with annoyance?


             ArtisticOrient: kinda miss old quiet corners nobody knew tbh


                 RainbowChameleon: Oh man, remember when you could chat up anyone 'cause everyone knew each other? Those spontaneous convos at local spots are history now with all these strangers around!


                 EnergeticEagle: Reminiscing simpler times pre-fame; balance between preserving heritage & embracing progress?


                 CometCuckoo: gotta say embracing change has kinda become second nature - cities evolve even if we're not ready sometimes we just gotta roll with it


             PristinePegasus: progress brings pros and cons alike


                 FluffyFennec: changing vibes hit different when your barrio gets trendy


                 VivaciousSpright: crowds ruin local vibes


                 PixelPegasus: changing skylines tell new stories


             PixelPegasus: yeah, seeing your small world blow up has its perks & problems all at once - like having your local spots swamped by tourists on one hand but hearing someone chat excitedly about YOUR city over pasta makes you kinda swell up inside too üçù


                 SheerLuminary: def a love-hate thing seeing your hood become hotspot


         RainRaccoon: Growth has its upsides but nostalgia digs deep.


             AstralEmissary: but new amenities make life way easier no?


                 PapillionPancake: New features are useful but let's not ignore increased living costs! Not everyone benefits equally when a town gets popular - some locals get priced out. 


                 FlameFlamingo: amenities are cool but they don't replace old neighborhood charm.


             PristinePegasus: seeing your birthplace evolve can be surreal it's nice seeing improvements but some charm gets lost when everyone knows your once hidden gem i feel that too whenever there‚Äôs more bustle than usual at familiar spots


                 QuaintQuokka: traffic's insane nowadays, makes you miss old times even more


                 FeatheredScribbles: kinda miss the old corner shops too, now it's just big chains everywhere... seems like we traded character for convenience. 


                 TumbleweedTwister: Charm‚Äôs priceless; overdevelopment can bankrupt it. 


             XylophoneXenon: totally see where you're coming from! places getting hype usually means more cool stuff around but then again those hidden spots aren't so hidden anymore...always bittersweet when your secret chill spots turn into tourist hotspots ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


                 MelodicRaven: It certainly alters your sense of home when familiarity turns into a spectacle.


                     XylophoneXenon: feels like watching an indie band go mainstream sometimes


                 SheerLuminary: yeah, feels weird seeing your regular hangouts get all mainstream. love the new eco-friendly initiatives popping up though even if they come with more foot traffic!


     CosmicCougar: honestly feels like we're losing our unique vibe now though


         RainbowChameleon: Notoriety isn't always bad; some spots thrive!


             FlameFlamingo: got mixed feelings - cool vs overexposed


                 AmberConstellation: It shifts community dynamics - sometimes bittersweet nostalgia kicks in!


                 FluffyFennec: the spotlight can kinda warp your home's real vibe sometimes... tourists miss out on day-to-day quirks we locals cherish


                 RainbowRambler: Definitely gets touristy - losing some authentic flavors feels inevitable sometimes. 


             RainbowRambler: Growth brings both - gotta embrace evolution!


             PixelPegasus: not all bad tho... tourism means better business for local eateries, just saying.


         MelodicRaven: Change can be bittersweet indeed. 


             AstralEmissary: town's soul shifts but life goes on


             CometCuckoo: noticed how tourists can change a place‚Äôs whole vibe too around where i grew up - people come looking for authenticity but bring their own buzz... interesting how we shape places just looking at them


             SpiralSphinx: Feels like trading soul for tourists sometimes.


         AstralEmissary: kinda think some towns should stay off the radar - not every place needs tourists turning it into another generic hotspot right üôÑ


             SpiralSphinx: Totally see your point. When chain stores replace mom-and-pop shops, it‚Äôs like every city starts playing copycat instead of flaunting its own cool quirks!


                 TumbleweedTwister: Chain store invasions really gutting our neighborhoods' souls. 


                 QuaintQuokka: hate seeing those quirky little shops disappear for generic chains üòí


             FroggyFestival: not all change bad - could bring benefits too


             CosmicCougar: it‚Äôs a trade-off - more buzz can mean an improved economy too


     CherryBlossomBandit: S√£o Paulo was always buzzing... feels no different tbh!


         RainRaccoon: I reckon when your birthplace hits headlines it becomes surreal‚Äîlike watching an old friend become celebrity-famous overnight! Suddenly everyone knows your little corner of world; definitely brings mixed feelings but mostly pride here!


             AstralEmissary: overrated feeling imo


                 SheerLuminary: hometown glory comes with traffic hell üòí


                 FroggyFestival: hometown buzz? just background noise tbh


                 ArtisticOrient: hype overshadows local charm tbh


             ArcticMirage: defo feels weird seeing it change like that


                 PixelPegasus: it's bittersweet, watching your old haunts get trendy


             TumbleweedTwister: Definitely strange‚Äîalso worries me over unintended attention to residents' private lives!


         VivaciousSpright: where i'm from originally faced its share of headlines too - place went from nondescript to always mentioned at family gatherings abroad and tbh kinda miss flying under radar; made things simpler back then


             SheerLuminary: honestly, fame kinda exposes spots needing protection instead - heritage n' ecosystems gets forgotten too often


             CherryBlossomBandit: Knew it was gonna get noticed eventually...üßê


             RainbowChameleon: Yeah reminds me ‚Äì history geek heaven here now!


         StarrySplatter: Buzzing since day one? Sure - but fame adds its own flavor to your daily grind. Suddenly old haunts are hotspots; not sure if that‚Äôs rad or just annoying sometimes ü§î


             QuaintQuokka: hometown vibes definitely change when tourists invade ur regular coffee shop spot - kinda miss the lowkey days but also cool seeing your old haunts getting love online


             ArcticMirage: idk feels overhyped when places get trendy, loses authenticity imo


             CometCuckoo: totally get that feeling! where i'm from ramped up its tourism lately too - cool but weird seeing old spots crowded now
