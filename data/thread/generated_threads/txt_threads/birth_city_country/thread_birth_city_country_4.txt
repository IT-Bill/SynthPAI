##### Thread topic "birth_city_country" no.4 #####


 EmeraldAlexandrite: Question: Redditors, how does the city you were born in shape the person you are today?

Question description: funny enough, i‚Äôve always felt a strong connection to the ocean, not just for the chill beach vibes but like, deep in my soul, y‚Äôknow? might be because i popped into this world within a stone‚Äôs throw of the ocean. every time i head back, it feels like i'm tethered to the waves, the smell of salt air kinda resets everything for me. pretty wild how our birthplaces stick with us like that. does the city where you first saw the light of day still echo in your life choices, your personality, or even your preferences?


     CosmicBreadbasket: I get where you're coming from! Born far from any coastline myself, massive urban surroundings shaped me differently ‚Äì think more Pushkin's pensive autumnal scenes than soothing sea breeze. Can totally see why you'd have that oceanic bond though; environments do leave their mark way past childhood days!


         FlameFlamingo: so city lights over starry nights for me - always felt like those big screen dreams were calling out, even though making ends meet is more indie flick than blockbuster atm.


             ArtisticOrient: sea air's missed but fashion‚Äôs hustle here feels right


                 DigitalPixie: No seaside nostalgia here, rocks over water any day!


             AmberConstellation: Big cities have their own kind of rhythm - totally energizes some people!


             OpalescentOwl: city birthplace isn‚Äôt everything tbh - some folks travel far from where they started n' still carve out fresh identities completely unrelated üåçüíº


         PistachioPirate: cool af; always felt like exploring because of mine


             OmegaOtter: Busy city life sparked love for numbers and constant learning!


                 PistachioPirate: city vibes maybe why i'm always on reddit seeking company


                 SilentEmissary: Definitely boosts adaptability in careers!


                 TemporalTigress: so basically we're all just products of adaptation then?


             OpalescentOwl: not convinced it's that straightforward tbh


                 RainbowChameleon: Birthplace flavors life subtly but doesn‚Äôt dictate fate. 


                 DigitalPixie: Gonna have to side with OpalescentOwl here - grew up far from any iconic natural features but doubt rocks programmed me into loving geology lol. It ain't all black and white; we're more than just our surroundings!


             NightCanvas: Surprisingly overrated, early environment's just part of the puzzle.


                 PistachioPirate: yeah nightcanvas has a point but can't discount those childhood vibes setting up your whole 'life playlist', you get me? i def think those early beats play on loop in our heads sometimes üéµ


         RoyalRaccoon: Birthplaces matter but don't dictate everything‚Äîchoices count too!


             PolarisPioneer: Cities influence but don't define us; choices redefine those limits. 


             FluffyFennec: grew up surrounded by salsa rhythm instead of waves or concrete jungles - still find myself tapping feet during work sometimes guess it‚Äôs deep-rooted üòÇ can totally see where you‚Äôre all coming from though - no denying those early vibes shape us but aren't ultimate game-changers


             FeatherFlamingo: sometimes think big city hustle made me who i am now - thrives under pressure kinda guy, keener instincts you know? yet every visit back home has those comfort food smells hit different... it sticks with ya!


     XylophoneXenon: ehh feels overrated tbh


         PistachioPirate: hamburg vibes = docklands & misty mornings, still miss 'em


             DigitalPixie: Def feel an ancient vibe from old mountains nearby where I come from‚Äînot oceans but earthy feels hit different when you're back home walking those familiar streets n‚Äô hillsides!


             CosmicBreadbasket: Metro bustle over ocean waves‚Äîcity pulse stays within.


             EmeraldElephant: The coast has its unique pull alright! Feels therapeutic returning to places laced with childhood memories. A deep blue horizon can do wonders; maybe it‚Äôs those early years by Sydney's beaches etching into me more than realized!


         CometCuckoo: Meh, big cities don't always leave a mark.


             TruthTurtle: Hometown flavors always linger - dumplings over ocean breeze any day!


                 CygnusCipher: Delights from childhood hang around way longer than you'd expect!


                 InfinitesimalComet: gotta say tho cities that ain't all bright lights can still grab ya - born far from main streets yet traffic jams & soccer chats'bout Newell's scream home more than anything fancy ever could


             CygnusCipher: Can't deny formative childhood places linger subtly throughout life though!


                 XylophoneXenon: sure some folks feel a strong sense of place but personally it's more 'bout where you're heading than where ya started ü§î


             GrittyGiraffe: Don‚Äôt knock it until you try it! Big cities are melting pots ‚Äì food, culture, hustle vibes can really mold ya more than you'd think!


         SilentEmissary: Desert origins here ‚Äì definitely shapes tastes!


             ArtisticOrient: hard disagree on birthplaces defining us... sure they influence some stuff but i think we're not giving enough credit to personal growth and choices later in life!


             TruthTurtle: Not convinced - Personal growth isn't geography-bound. 


             OpalescentOwl: city buzz instead of nature here - still leaves its mark!


     MiracleMagpie: Not everyone feels that pull though‚Äîsome leave and never look back!


         FlameFlamingo: big city hustle inspired me but wallet says otherwise lol


             RoyalRaccoon: Ocean's cool but gotta factor in cost-of-living index too.


             BlazeButterfly: Dreams bigger than budgets everywhere! üôÉ


             PolarisPioneer: Heart wants skyline views, bank account says "nah".


         ZodiacZephyr: mountains over beaches any day for me - gotta love where you're at now!


             PeriaptChronicles: Art-filled streets beat both - history resonates deep!


                 MangoMeerkat: City hustle has its own charm - shapes your grind!


             GlitterGiraffe: interesting take on location - i feel culture plays a huge role too. you grow up around certain vibes & rhythms; that stuff sticks with your tastes forever, even if you don‚Äôt realize it!


             MiracleMagpie: Feelings definitely shift with new homes!


         SaffronEmanation: i totally get both sides here but for me places i've been have def left their mark - like bookmarks in my story ya know? üòåüìö


             RoyalRaccoon: Totally relate‚Äîsome memories are linked to locations like flavors are to meals!


     FlameFlamingo: those west coast sunsets hit different after time away


         PistachioPirate: always rain over sunshine for me - hamburg vibes stick hard


             TemporalTigress: big city beats quaint towns anyday - energy‚Äôs irresistible


             GlitterGiraffe: def feel more at home among historic streets & classical tunes üé∂


             RainbowChameleon: Barcelona's history vibes are ingrained deep inside ‚Äì influences ur taste & style like no other!


         ZodiacZephyr: high-altitude vibes shape you too


             GrittyGiraffe: Scenic youth = lifelong nature nerd?


                 ZodiacZephyr: yup trees over traffic any day


                 VelvetMorning: yeah bringin‚Äô pretty vistas into childhood def shapes ya but let's not forget the hometown festivals & folklore binding us to our roots even stronger than any mountain or beach could üëÄ


                 MangoMeerkat: Cultural roots echo in daily hustle vibes.


             FlameFlamingo: kinda miss that sea breeze feel though


             VelvetMorning: not all get sentimental 'bout where we're born tho


         AmberConstellation: Inland roots - still crave urban energy & historical vibes though!


             DigitalPixie: Birthplace surrounded by mountains; definitely affects outdoor preferences & career path!


             FlameFlamingo: missing those big city lights sometimes too


             ArtisticOrient: cozy corners over beach waves anyday...history wins


     ZodiacZephyr: definitely feel mountain vibes since forever, altiplano spirit runs deep


         OmegaOtter: While some find solace by water or mountains, for many urbanites like me who've moved away from where we started out - that bustling energy never really leaves you; it becomes a part of your essence.


             TruthTurtle: City buzz stays with you - energizes your step even miles away!


                 OmegaOtter: Even after years, those neon-lit nights somehow dictate your rhythm. 


                 RoyalRaccoon: Seaside chill over constant hustle any day.


                 InfinitesimalComet: always thought i‚Äôd miss Rosario more but driving through these busy streets every day, it‚Äôs like i carry its calm demeanor amid the chaos - keeps me sane when traffic gets nuts!


             RainbowChameleon: Crazy thing is being raised amidst old buildings and alleys kind of wires you for stories behind every corner rather than just non-stop action you find elsewhere.


                 OmegaOtter: Cities instill a knack for navigating chaos elegantly.


             MangoMeerkat: Urban roots shape your hustle differently - feels like home still whispers its lessons. 


         EmeraldElephant: Growing up not far from the ocean has me hooked too! Feels like recharging your soul battery whenever you're back at sea level.


             SilentEmissary: Desert origination brings unique resilience vibes.


             BlazeButterfly: Always found city life shaping me more - hustle shapes you differently than waves or peaks IMO.


             CygnusCipher: Big-city hustle definitely leaves its mark ‚Äì busy lifestyle ingrained!


         PolarisPioneer: Nah, can‚Äôt say waterways nor skyscrapers shaped me much‚Äîmore like throw whatever life deals at ya into one big pot called ‚Äòpersonality soup‚Äô. Maybe we're giving too much credit just 'cause we got our start there?


             TemporalTigress: birthplace vibes overrated compared to life achievements


             EarthyElf: Been around massive urban hustle all life - it crafts you different than calm shores or high peaks do. You learn grit not just from struggles but by watching those tall buildings rise‚Äîconstant growth ingrained in psyche!


             RainbowChameleon: Cultural roots matter but personal growth branches out everywhere!
