 CosmicStoryteller: Question: What's an 'adulting' milestone you're proud of, but seems trivial to others?

Question description: ya know, i hit this point recently where i made my own dentist appointment without prompting. felt like a major adulting win. never thought i‚Äôd be jazzed about teeth health, but here we are. maybe because I'm at that stage where I'm realizing i'm fully in the driver's seat of my life. It‚Äôs funny how these little things feel like trophies in the game of growing up. anyone else have moments like that? the smaller, the better - let‚Äôs hear those mundane victories!
