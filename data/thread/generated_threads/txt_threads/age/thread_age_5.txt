 EmeraldAlexandrite: Question: At what age did you truly start to feel 'grown up', and what moment made it click for you?

Question description: you know the feeling when you just sorted out your tax returns, set up a savings plan, and actually followed through? well, i got that adulting buzz recently and it got me reflecting. For me, it wasn't until i had a solid convo with a 20-year-old and realized i was giving advice that wasn't just theoretical but actually lived. It hit me, man, i'm not just 'aging', i'm evolving with experience. when did you guys have that "holy smokes, i'm an adult" moment?
