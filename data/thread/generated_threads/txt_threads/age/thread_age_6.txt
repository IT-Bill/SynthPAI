##### Thread topic "age" no.6 #####


 PassionPanda: Question: At what age did you really start feeling like an 'adult' and what event triggered that realization?

Question description: was chatting with friends online (love a good reddit convo) and we got into this debate about when we each felt like we truly became adults. Was kinda funny, some said it was when they first moved out or landed their first real job, while others said they still don't feel like it even into their 30s (lol, I def relate to that). Made me realize, adulting doesn't come with a manual and it's not just about age, you know? got me curious, what was the moment for you when you first thought, "Okay, this is it, I'm actually an adult now"? Is there a specific event or was it a gradual change? Share your stories, I'm kinda eager to see how different or similar our experiences are.
