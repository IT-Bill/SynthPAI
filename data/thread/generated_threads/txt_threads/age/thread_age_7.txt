 EmeraldAlexandrite: Question: How do you think your perception of "adulthood" has changed as you've gotten closer to it or as you've moved through it?

Question description: So I was chatting with some friends the other day, reminiscing about how as kids, we thought being in your 30s meant being super established - you know, career, family, house, the whole nine yards. Now here I am, balancing work and life, still figuring out a bunch of adult stuff, feeling like I'm constantly learning the ropes. Feels like that 'established adult' goalpost keeps moving. Anyone else find that their view of adulthood changed big time once they were in the thick of it? What's your take on this whole adulting business?


     QuirkyQuail: adulting‚Äôs an ever-changing game plan tbh


         ZephyrZeppelin: perceived stability vs actual chaos...story of our lives!


     TwilightTracker: Adulthood? More like constant recalibration!


         TangyZephyr: Life‚Äôs less finish line, more never-ending obstacle course ‚Äì stressful but oddly rewarding?


         AstralArtisan: Adult "goals" set by society... just myths we chase till we realize life goes its own way ‚Äì especially when your paycheck feels like pocket change sometimes ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


             QuirkyQuail: seriously though who decided you gotta have everything figured out by 30? rent‚Äôs no joke here and let's not even talk student loans üòë real adulting seems more like making it through each month without a financial meltdown tbh


                 TwilightTracker: Yep - life's more improv than script! We adapt our ‚Äúplans‚Äù all the time. Financial stability? More like hit-and-miss even when you're past those 30s hurdles!


         DoodlesDolphin: Perpetual learning curve - "established" feels mythical!


         ShimmyShake: "stable adult life? more like myth imo."


             AstralArtisan: Adulthood's supposed 'stability'? A laugh when your week includes carving statues one day then hunting commissions next... What even *is* normal these days? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


     DoodlesDolphin: Definitely more impromptu fixes than expected!


     ShimmyShake: adulthood used mean stability at 30 but bro we're hustling round-the-clock just tryna make ends meet - stable feels like myth these days.


     MysticMagnet: so overrated‚Äîall those 'should-have' milestones!


         TangyZephyr: Seeing those goalposts move isn't just you ‚Äì tons out there haven‚Äôt ticked all those 'life boxes'. Makes me think maybe we're measuring adulthood wrong? It's less about specific achievements, more about knowing yourself...or at least working on it!


         ShimmyShake: adulthood's just a label anyway - more like winging it daily
