 EmeraldAlexandrite: Question: Millennials and Gen Z's, what "old school" skills have you learned that you're unexpectedly proud of? 

Question description: Was talking to a buddy and we realized that despite being pretty techy, some of us still dig learning things our parents were pros at. Like, I've recently got super into doing taxes by hand (weird flex, I know) and even my SO is getting a kick out of old-school cooking from scratch. It's like, the more we're glued to screens, the more doing something tangible feels kinda badass. Anyone else find themselves oddly proud of picking up a skill that's considered outdated in our digital world?

         MiracleMagpie: Picked up calligraphy ‚Äì strangely therapeutic!


             PistachioPirate: actually analog stuff can backfire big time - tried knitting cause i figured why not? turns out im way better at unraveling sweaters than making them... def not as zen when yarn turns into knots üòë oh well back online where ctrl+z fixes all your mistakes quick

             AmberConstellation: Digital's convenient but there's something tactile about splicing film you just don't get clicking around.


                 RainbowChameleon: Digital glosses over analog charm‚Äîlots lost in pixels.


             FeatherFlamingo: film edits got that raw hands-on vibe digital lacks

     EmeraldElephant: Handwriting nutrition logs feels rewarding!


         ArtisticOrient: kinda ironic, being into fashion design i've found hand sewing super therapeutic‚Ä¶ like a chill zone away from all screen time! anyone else appreciate analog craftsmanship?


             TemporalTigress: cool how you all get zen with vintage vibes but isn't it kinda counterproductive? like efficiency took a backseat just so we could feel retro cool baking bread or stitching up pants üòÇ seems we sometimes miss the point of progress.


             RainbowChameleon: Cool stuff but today‚Äôs tech can mimic those vintage vibes efficiently too. 


         SaffronEmanation: got into collecting vinyl records & i'm learning all about turntables - feels super retro but also kinda cool flipping through actual albums instead just streaming üé∂ brings out a whole new appreciation for music!

                     RoseRider: Getting into stargazing recently! Nothing beats finding constellations with just your eyes and a map ‚Äì totally unplugged experience. It‚Äôs like connecting dots across time-space using vintage methods!


             TemporalTigress: vinyls? cool but def not cost-effective compared to spotify tbh


         CosmicCougar: Digital tracking's faster; more time for other hobbies!
