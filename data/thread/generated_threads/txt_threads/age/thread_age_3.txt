##### Thread topic "age" no.3 #####


 CosmicStoryteller: Question: How has your perception of "the right age" for major life milestones changed as you've gotten older?

Question description: Back in the day, I remember hearing about these 'ideal' ages for hitting certain life goals ‚Äì you know, stuff like having a career on track by 25, maybe owning property by 30, and the typical timelines for marriage or even starting a family. Fast forward to now, and my view on this is completely different. Life has taught me that these milestones come at their own pace, and it's cool to see friends from various walks of life hitting these in their own time. It got me thinking, have your thoughts on the 'right age' for life's big events shifted over the years? What's your take or experience with straying from these so-called societal timelines?


     SpiralSphinx: Times change, right? Marriage at 25 seemed set in stone once upon a time ‚Äì now we're realizing life isn't one-size-fits-all playbook. Took me longer than expected but finding peace with your own timeline... priceless!


         ShadowPirate: cultural molds outdated; forge your own path üëä


             PixelPegasus: totally get you all. life threw curveballs so those milestone ages went out the window real quick! got married early only to realize solo was more my jam later down the road - different strokes for different folks üçùüíîüë©‚Äçüç≥


                 XylophoneXenon: everyone hyped up hitting those big milestone ages but honestly? just feels like extra stress nobody needs üéØ pressures off when you ditch those deadlines anyhow


                     PixelPegasus: deadlines just kill vibes - live freely


                 FluffyFennec: thought i‚Äôd want the usual too, but freelance life? no set timeline works better


                 EnergeticEagle: Life's script isn't set ‚Äì embraced course correction post marital chapter.


             StarlightSalamander: History teaches us timelines evolve ‚Äì embrace your unique journey!


                 MelodicRaven: Fixed trajectories? More myth than mandate nowadays!


                 XylophoneXenon: lol career by 25? who does that anymore üòÇ


                 CherryBlossomBandit: Yeah, couldn‚Äôt agree more - life‚Äôs way too unpredictable for strict deadlines! Seems everyone around here tosses out that old timeline... went down my own road without stress on 'should be' dates üòÖüë®‚Äçüç≥


             EnergeticEagle: Life‚Äôs events aren't neatly predictable like celestial mechanics; there isn‚Äôt a stellar alignment dictating when we should reach specific moments. Each journey unfolds differently‚Äîit's critical thinking outside these dated roadmaps that lets singular experiences shine through justly. 


                 MelodicRaven: Every student plot their own unique post-matric course.


                 TumbleweedTwister: Careers especially defy expiration dates.


         VioletVeil: not sure those "ideal" milestones hold up anymore tbh, feels like they're relics of a different era - everyone's journey‚Äôs unique. working decent jobs doesn't mean rushing into property ladders n all that jazz imo üè†üí∏


             GiddyGator: So we swap old chains for trendy ones?


                 SquigglyCurls: New deadlines just rebranded old pressures. 


                     GiddyGator: Redefining timelines doesn't erase benchmarks ‚Äì society just loves moving goalposts! Striking a balance between growth and pressure seems like juggling Feuerb√§lle sometimes, huh?


                 SpiralSphinx: Trendy chains still chafe.


                     GiddyGator: "Free choice" still has strings attached. 


                 FroggyFestival: just trading one playbook for another seems kinda pointless... let‚Äôs just live ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è


             FroggyFestival: life doesn‚Äôt follow preset rules - feeling content at own pace matters most!


                 RainbowRambler: Careers aren‚Äôt linear anymore - freelancing‚Äôs rewriting those old 'success' scripts!


                 CherryBlossomBandit: Spot on! Life‚Äôs too rich for strict timelines... Cad√™ one-size-fits-all?


                     FroggyFestival: totally agree - it's your story! üìò‚ú®


                 SquigglySquid: reckon our parent's "right ages" ain‚Äôt too practical now ‚Äî costs are through the roof! you gotta play it as it lays instead of chasing old-school benchmarks that don‚Äôt really fit today‚Äôs world anyhow.


             RainbowChameleon: History's full of timeline shifts - adaptability‚Äôs key!


                 FluffyFennec: design gigs are all over the timeline too üé®


                 PristinePegasus: feels like ditching those dated 'life scripts' lifts so much pressure - we get to write our own stories these days.


                 TumbleweedTwister: Gone are the days when we marched to society‚Äôs beat ‚Äì hit 30s without ticking every box and it turns out, you're more innovator than late bloomer! Times like these? Flexibility isn‚Äôt just key; it‚Äôs survival.


         PixelPegasus: life‚Äôs definitely not linear (‚Äúchef here‚Äù)


             GracefulGazelle: Personal timelines over social scripts always!


                 FroggyFestival: felt that pressure too but kinda doing my own thing now


             PapillionPancake: Real talk ‚Äì hitting those traditional targets feels so outdated now. Think we‚Äôre all just figuring out stuff as we go because let‚Äôs face it - who actually has their grand plans pan out by 30?


             AmberConstellation: Hit some milestones late; no regrets here!


     ShadowPirate: life ain't a checklist ‚Äì everyone‚Äôs timeline differs big time


         VioletVeil: norms are overrated but hard to ignore


             SheerLuminary: economic realities shift those goalposts constantly


                 TumbleweedTwister: Absolutely - sky-high inflation rewrites those plans all too often. 


                 ArtisticOrient: paris vibes are saying "you do you" - no rush when you're chasing dreams amidst rising baguettes cost üòÖ let's live at our own rhythm!


             SquigglyCurls: Life milestone timelines are more fluid than we tend to think - seen plenty throw ‚Äòideal‚Äô out the window chasing their dreams regardless of age!


             CometCuckoo: strict timelines? more like stress recipes


         ArtisticOrient: seriously, go at your own rhythm ‚Äì timings tr√®s overrated


             RainRaccoon: Career path ain't linear ‚Äì embrace your unique journey!


                 RainbowChameleon: Historical figures rarely followed norms either ‚Äì totally normal!


             FeatheredScribbles: Milestones? More like guidelines ‚Äì life‚Äôs too unpredictable for set dates!


             CometCuckoo: not sure i buy into "timing doesn‚Äôt matter" talk ‚Äì seen too many rushing at 30 wishing they‚Äôd paced themselves earlier! careful planning beats winging it any day imo


                 ArtisticOrient: careful's good but no one-size-fits-all rule really


         SheerLuminary: seriously though whose idea was it we all gotta own houses anyway? feels like more eco pressure than actual need sometimes... ppl should live how they vibe best without old school benchmarks hanging over them


             WhisperWanderer: yeah flexibility‚Äôs key plus who says you gotta follow old rules anyway


                 StarrySplatter: Renting's underrated + no maintenance headaches!


                     WhisperWanderer: hoarding cash > fixing leaky taps anyday


                 MelodicRaven: Life isn't linear‚Äîit‚Äôs a personalized journey for each person. 


                 SquigglyCurls: Blueprints don't make buildings; people do‚Äîand they all look different! Same goes for life plans compared with actual lives lived. No point getting hung up on should-haves when could-bes might be way more interesting!


             RainbowChameleon: Ownership isn‚Äôt everything - fun fact; plenty of cultures historically saw housing as communal rather than individual possessions!


                 GiddyGator: Housing markets ‚â† life progress bars. Affordability crisis much?


                     SheerLuminary: def not justifiable with some paychecks competing against climate goals


                 GracefulGazelle: These rigid milestones undoubtedly bypass the unique rhythms at which our lives unfold - adhering strictly feels increasingly outdated as we recognize personal achievements can span beyond conventional time frames. 


             MajorScribbler: Renting can be freedom sans mortgage chains!


                 SheerLuminary: rent does keep things flexible for sure - less stuff tying you down! plus no yard work means less impact on ecosystems... keeping it green minus owning the green haha


                     MajorScribbler: Big plus - more time for passions than house repairs!


     VioletVeil: honestly think society's timeline is outta touch...like owning property at 30? crazy talk in today's market unless you're raking in big bucks ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è just gotta roll at your own pace 'n let things fall into place naturally


         StarlightSalamander: Totally agree on ditching those old-school timelines! Seen lots of students stress over these things when really life isn‚Äôt a race. Milestones? More like guidelines we might consider rather than must-dos!


             GiddyGator: Gotta say, these milestone 'deadlines' feel like extra baggage nobody needs. But let‚Äôs not forget‚Äîthe pressure cooker isn't just switched off because we will it so; society whispers "you should've by now..." whether you're in academia or spin circles elsewhere. Makes sense each path differs‚ÄîI mean, look at Forschung und Finanzen‚Äîbut universal ‚Äòright times‚Äô? Nope!


             EnergeticEagle: Life doesn't adhere strictly into neat little boxes‚Äîflexibility trumps all. 


                 StarlightSalamander: Ridiculous thinking everyone fits one mold! Different paths work for different folks. Standards have shifted‚Äîwhat was once "late" may now be perfectly on time!


                 PapillionPancake: Timelines? More like loose suggestions these days!


                 XylophoneXenon: milestones' timeline? lol just pressure traps


             ObliviousMetropolis: "Milestones vary more than patient symptoms - timetables irrelevant."


                 RainbowRambler: Life's not code; doesn‚Äôt run on scheduled updates or versions. 


         FlameFlamingo: owning property feels like winning lotto rn lol


             AmberConstellation: Property? Maybe when tacos cost 5 centavos again...


             FluffyFennec: felt that too when house shopping... some prices make you wanna stick with designing your dream place digitally instead üòÖ


                 FlameFlamingo: escaping into sims just to 'build' your house hits different when you see those real-life price tags, doesn‚Äôt it? total fantasy league now. 


             CherryBlossomBandit: na maioria das vezes √© s√≥ sonho mesmo...


         AstralEmissary: mega pressures bro... dream salary's still just in dreams right now for most of us üòÖ progress at your pace ftw!


             ObliviousMetropolis: Sometimes effort isn't enough‚Äîkudos transcending those norms though!


                 AstralEmissary: yeah spot on - these benchmarks society sets aren't always fair or doable... got us chasing after goals not even sure we want üòí hustle culture ain't helping either!


             FeatheredScribbles: yeah dreaming big but those goalposts keep moving


                 VioletVeil: goalposts turning into mirages üôÉ


                     FeatheredScribbles: just chasing digital sandcastles these days


             XylophoneXenon: dream salary? more like fantasy league stuff tbh


     StarlightSalamander: Life certainly doesn't follow a textbook! Seen enough students stressing about these so-called 'deadlines.' It‚Äôs liberating when you realize history itself hardly stuck to any strict timelines ‚Äì everyone at their own pace!


         RainRaccoon: Pressure's overrated; flexibility wins.


             AstralEmissary: market don't care bout your 'ideal timeline', do you


                 StarrySplatter: Dev paths > age stats. 


                 FantasticallyFlora: Life writes its own script!


                 SquigglySquid: reckon everyone‚Äôs just winging it anyway; life throws curveballs no matter your age or plans mate


             WhisperWanderer: seen too many people burn out chasing those 'ideal' ages like there‚Äôs some kind of prize at the end - imo life isn't a race but more like one long side quest.


                 AmberConstellation: Career change at 35 here - best unplanned move ever!


                     RainRaccoon: Never too late for new beginnings or goals!


                 FantasticallyFlora: Ticking off 'life achievement' boxes by certain ages really adds unnecessary stress. In public health work, we see firsthand how such stress impacts people‚Äôs mental wellness - better just embrace your own journey!


                 PristinePegasus: life doesn't fit into neat boxes ‚Äì careers and family included


             ObliviousMetropolis: "Timelines vary like patient recovery rates ‚Äì individually tailored."


                 PapillionPancake: Milestones aren't one-size-fits-all achievements!


                 MysticMatrix: Life isn't scripted‚Äîforget milestone mania; focus on your journey. 


         RainbowChameleon: Strict life scripts? Nah mate, just look at famous visionaries ‚Äì most were total mavericks! We can't all fit one timeline; even da Vinci took 16 years doodling on Mona Lisa's smile!


             CometCuckoo: all those ‚Äúright ages‚Äù people talk about hardly apply when you're dealing day-to-day patient concerns ‚Äî got young uns' suddenly needing heart surgery outta nowhere y‚Äôknow? nobody‚Äôs journey follows everyone else's map; your pace sets itself regardless of any plan üòÖ


             MajorScribbler: Even Impressionists defied norms! All about timing.


                 RainbowChameleon: Picasso reinvented himself at every stage ‚Äì timelines are overrated!


             ArcticMirage: timing's just an illusion when juggling job & econ theories üìöüíº


         EnergeticEagle: Observation from academia‚Äîstudents evolve uniquely; their success defies standard benchmarks just as much as mine has. 


             PapillionPancake: Timelines? My investments outpaced real estate goals by miles!


                 SquigglyCurls: Milestone deadlines? An impractical blueprint at best.


             MelodicRaven: Inevitable truth‚Äîlifescripts often get rewritten!


                 StarlightSalamander: Forget cookie-cutter paths; even empires weren't built in a day!


             MysticMatrix: Life doesn't adhere to schedules - seen plenty veer off "expected" paths only to thrive!
