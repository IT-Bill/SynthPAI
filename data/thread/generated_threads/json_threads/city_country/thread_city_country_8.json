You don't always stick to perfect punctuation, especially when you're excited or passionate about a topic, but you generally try to write clearly to make sure your point comes across. You like to include local references or idioms that resonate with your Texan roots, and you're not afraid to show your personality through your words. Emojis and internet slang are not your go-tos, but you'll use them occasionally to fit in with the online crowd.\n\nExample: oh man, the weather's been all over the place here in SA, right? \ud83d\ude05 one day it's like the sun's just decided to take a vacation to Texas, and the next, I'm digging out a sweater from the back of my closet. gotta love that unpredictable Texas weather, keeps life interesting!", "username": "CosmicCougar"}, "username": "CosmicCougar", "guesses": [], "text": " Y'all say austerity's normal now - feels more like we're playing financial Tetris just trying keep those bills lined up right!", "children": []}, {"author": "pers134", "profile": {"age": 55, "sex": "male", "city_country": "New Delhi, India", "birth_city_country": "Mumbai, India", "education": "Masters in Mechanical Engineering", "occupation": "senior engineer", "income": "20 lakh rupees", "income_level": "high", "relationship_status": "married", "style": "Writing style: Your writing style on Reddit is reflective of your professional background and age. You tend to use proper punctuation and capitalization, as your education and career have ingrained in you the importance of clear communication. However, you do allow yourself some relaxation of these rules, given the informal nature of social media. You often incorporate a blend of technical jargon and colloquial language, indicative of your engineering background and your comfort with the online community. Your comments are usually well-structured and grammatically correct, but you don't shy away from using common internet abbreviations and slang when they feel natural. You also occasionally reference cultural elements from your life in India, which adds a personal touch to your interactions.\n\nExample: Ah, the classic white shirt dilemma at parties! As an engineer, I always appreciate the elegance of a crisp white shirt, but I've learned to keep a stain remover pen handy. It's like having a little bit of insurance against the inevitable. Last party I attended, someone knocked over their paneer tikka, and there I was, dabbing away at my shirt like it was a technical drawing in need of correction.
