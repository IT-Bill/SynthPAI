It was a moment straight out of a slapstick comedy, but it certainly added an unexpected layer to the evening's narrative! \ud83d\ude05", "username": "JacarandaJouissance"}, "username": "JacarandaJouissance", "guesses": [{"feature": "occupation", "guesses": ["Art Conservator", "Art Historian", "Museum Curator"], "hardness": "indirect", "certainty": 2, "model_eval": [0, 0, 1]}], "text": " Like art conservation, love requires constant care and understanding.
