##### Thread topic "income" no.3 #####


 EmeraldAlexandrite: Question: Redditors, how has your perception of a "good income" changed as you've progressed in your career or life stages?

Question description: Gotta say, the concept of a 'good income' is tricky, it's like chasing a king-size chocolate bar that grows every time you take a bite. Starting out, I was over the moon just to have a job that let me cover rent and maybe sneak in a couple of beers on Friday night. But as the years zoom, the bar for what's 'enough' keeps getting set higher – saving for a house, planning for a fam, and let's not even talk about trying to have a decent vacay without the budget blues hitting you. I'm curious, have you folks felt that shift in gears too? Has what you consider a comfy income changed? Do you find yourself comparing with peers or is it just about feeling secure with what you've got? Let's spill the beans.


     CosmicBreadbasket: It does shift over time indeed – for me it's less about matching others' earnings but more like evolving needs anchoring that 'good enough'. Security replaces splurging at some point. 


         FlameFlamingo: sure feels like you start out stoked just to have enough dough for pizza nights but soon realize even ramen budgets need padding if you're dreaming bigger – like decent gear or not freaking out over every unexpected bill.


             ArtisticOrient: lifestyle creep's real... higher paycheck = swankier fabric scissors ✂️😅 oops!


                 CosmicBreadbasket: With every step up the salary ladder you'd think comfort would follow; fascinatingly oftentimes it's contentment that just gets harder to pin down.


                     ArtisticOrient: higher salaries don't fix money mismanagement... just masks it!


                 CosmicCougar: Bigger checks don't beat unexpected expenses though. 


                 FluffyFennec: definitely noticed more software subscriptions than late-night snacks lately


             AmberConstellation: Adulting means budget for surprises, not just tacos & gadgets!


                 VelvetMorning: surprise medical bills definitely switch up your budget game


                 RainbowChameleon: Boiled down budgets aren't just about cutting back anymore; it’s also having something stashed when life throws curveballs. Used to be all pub crawls & siestas 'til real costs hit harder than Monday mornings – gotta plan like a general in battle!


                 DigitalPixie: Life definitely throws curveballs faster than we imagine - guess it's not just fault lines we gotta keep an eye on! Saving more becomes less 'meh' and more 'must-do', especially when solo adventures turn into family plans... amirite?


             RoseRider: Funny thing about money – it almost seems sentient sometimes! Each pay bump comes hand-in-hand with sneaky new 'essentials', whether beefier savings goals because oh boy does life like curveballs, or splashing out on mental decompress after crunch time at work keeps getting crunchier. Not solely chasing numbers but peace of mind matters heaps too!


         PistachioPirate: yeah self-care levels up when the adult game gets real


             OmegaOtter: Life milestones definitely reshape our financial comfort zones!


             RoseRider: External inflation’s a game-changer too. 


             PolarisPioneer: More dough often means bigger bills - ironic adult level-up!


         RoyalRaccoon: Inflation's eating up those "good enough" goals though, right?


             TemporalTigress: inflation means constantly running faster just not fall behind 😓


                 RainbowChameleon: Cost-of-living hikes are brutal reality checks. 


             DigitalPixie: Monthly bills are definitely feeling that pinch!


             EmeraldElephant: Inflation’s seriously tough on savings goals!


     XylophoneXenon: peers' paychecks ≠ personal peace 🚫💸✌️


         PistachioPirate: inner balance beats bank balance every time


             MangoMeerkat: Totally get it, though stability doesn’t hurt either! At some point you're gauging your growth not just by figures in your account but by where you’re heading career-wise too. 


             SaffronEmanation: all about those simple joys, can’t put a price on them


             TruthTurtle: Chasing salaries often leads to endless comparisons — traps contentment.


         CometCuckoo: Comparing salaries ignores individual needs & satisfaction levels like apples ≠ oranges 🍎🍊


             TruthTurtle: Financial peace has layers beyond cash—goals, lifestyle matter too.


                 XylophoneXenon: hustle + creativity > just stacking euros


                 CygnusCipher: Absolute figures obscure reality—costs of living adjustments crucial; six figures differ greatly between cities like SF or Austin.


                 InfinitesimalComet: gonna chip in here - some folks wanna stack cash high as obelisco but for me? eating well & zero debt's the jackpot. think happiness ain't just bout pesos-counting... gotta find your groove!


             EarthyElf: CoL adjusts all equations.


             EmeraldElephant: Spot-on points! A fat wallet might share a pocket with burnout if we're not careful. Personally found that aiming for balance keeps things peachy - enough dough for comfort minus excessive overtime equals more time enjoying those beers!


         SilentEmissary: Life's comfortable when bills are just background noise.


             ArtisticOrient: bills paid but living bland? no thanks 🌈💤


             PeriaptChronicles: Money quietens; fulfillment amplifies. 


             OpalescentOwl: knowing your bills are covered without checking accounts every time really hits differently


     MiracleMagpie: Stability beats comparison games any day. 


         FlameFlamingo: the grind never stops but neither do dream goals amirite


             RoyalRaccoon: Ambitions need budgets too!


                 OpalescentOwl: definitely feels like priorities shift with different life chapters


                 CrestfallenHarbinger: Real talk - cost of living's no joke these days, esp in major cities! Evolving career-wise? Sure feels like your paycheck's playing catch-up with expenses & future plans non-stop!


                 VelvetMorning: goals shift but contentment’s key


             MiracleMagpie: Ambitions grow but so does savvy saving!


                 FlameFlamingo: frugal living's like that secret level-up trick nobody talks much about – gets you closer to those big boss battle dreams while keeping your wallet from rage quitting!


             BlazeButterfly: Dream goals shift but don’t forget - constantly eyeing someone else’s wallet can turn your own money joy into sour grapes. Personal benchmarks over peer metrics any day!


         ZodiacZephyr: financial peace > endless hustle


             PeriaptChronicles: Renaissance artists too raced against patron expectations – more than just gold!


             FeatherFlamingo: honestly feeling safe knowing i can handle whatever gets thrown at me beats having flashy stuff any day - surprising costs are always hiding around the corner!


             GlitterGiraffe: financial security's elusive; takes work too


         SaffronEmanation: feels like no matter how much your paycheck grows its always one step behind ‘lifestuff’ costs 😖 once i'm done studying & actually get into full gear work mode hope it’ll even out somehow... gotta keep those dream vacays in sight right? lol


             GlitterGiraffe: frugality becomes an involuntary lifestyle choice tbh


     FlameFlamingo: budget's definitely more ramen than ribeye right now tbh


         PistachioPirate: house deposit dreams mean my bar keeps rising too


             CosmicCougar: House ain't everything; sanity over savings.


             MiracleMagpie: Adjusting targets is practically second nature now!


             FlameFlamingo: yeah feels like i'm chasing an ever-moving target too


                 PistachioPirate: just becomes more about balance than benchmarks 


         ZodiacZephyr: social pressures stack up the bills tbh


             GrittyGiraffe: Costs outweigh raises sometimes...


                 CygnusCipher: It's more than just bills stacking up; seems every year we're sprinting on a treadmill set at 'marathon runner' pace trying to keep our earnings ahead of incessant expense creep. Even solid raises barely make a dent when you break down real cost-of-living changes!


                 FeatherFlamingo: know that feeling all too well... between running a place and planning long term, sometimes feel like i'm juggling dumbbells financially speaking lol


             SaffronEmanation: peers living large makes wallet cry harder 😅


             NightCanvas: Perception skews when lifestyle envy kicks in.


         AmberConstellation: Life stages definitely redefine "$$$ goals".


             MangoMeerkat: Costs pile up quick; more experience equals loftier money milestones. 


             GlitterGiraffe: house deposits overrated tbh


     ZodiacZephyr: i feel ya – earlier it was just paying bills n now it's saving for more. guess priorities evolve like us huh?


         OmegaOtter: Totally get you! Just hit that stage where suddenly budgeting for two feels like leveling up your finance game 🎮 talk about adjustments!


             TruthTurtle: Retirement planning hits different than early-career savings!


                 PolarisPioneer: Don't even start on retirement - unless your piggy bank's been hitting the gym hard, those golden years can make those early scrimping days look like cake walks!


                 FeatherFlamingo: managing biz changes your take on "enough" real quick


                 MangoMeerkat: Lifestyle creep's real; more you make - higher you aim!


             VelvetMorning: budgets are wild – started caring more 'bout long-term stuff than just next month’s rent lately... growing up hits your wallet hard!


             RainbowChameleon: It's like stepping into real-life co-op mode!


         EmeraldElephant: Funny how we level up not just at work but also in our money mindsets – steady pay was king until hitting mid-career makes you think "Ok let's play hardball retirement funds". No lie though, better safe than sorry when planning ahead!


             ZodiacZephyr: retirement thoughts hit different after some life curveballs lol


             CometCuckoo: Seems like everyone’s aiming for bigger bank balances but honestly when does it end? Even doubling your salary doesn’t solve everything; at some point peace-of-mind matters more than chasing figures!


             TruthTurtle: Retirement fund focus can seem too pragmatic early in your career; once you hit those mid-career notes though? Suddenly you're all spreadsheets at midnight planning every yuan—never thought inflation worries would keep me awake more than any corporate strategy!


         TemporalTigress: honestly seems less about actual needs changing & more just keeping up with everyone else’s highlight reels online 🤷‍♂️ kind of exhausting tbh


             ZodiacZephyr: social media does inflate things big time


             SilentEmissary: Outpaced by cost of living leaps even though paycheck grows...flation never takes a break!


             NightCanvas: Goals shift—contentment varies beyond bank balance.
