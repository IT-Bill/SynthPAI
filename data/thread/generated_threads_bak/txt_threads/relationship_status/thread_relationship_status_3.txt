##### Thread topic "relationship_status" no.3 #####


 EmeraldAlexandrite: Question: Married, single, or it's complicated: has your current relationship status influenced your hobbies and leisure activities, and how?

Question description: Soo.. lately i‚Äôve been realizing that ever since I tied the knot, my gaming nights with buddies have drastically reduced and instead, i‚Äôm exploring things I never thought I would - like, say, salsa dancing. Guess you could say love makes you do new stuff, right? Or in some cases maybe drop some hobbies? How about you folks, noticed any shifts in your pastime pursuits post relationship status change? Share your transformations!


     CosmicBreadbasket: Post-divorce found me diving back into classic literature circles online‚Äîmy own kind of salsa dance! Personal reading lists are now longer than ever though; didn't see that coming!


         FlameFlamingo: films have been both work n study recently so not sure if it counts as shifting hobbies? though definitely getting wayyy deeper into indie flicks than ever thanks to all the free time flying solo gives you.


             ArtisticOrient: kinda became my own boss when it comes downs 2 designing clothes cuz who needs dating distractions anyway right lol


                 RainbowChameleon: Suddenly into culinary experiments at home‚Äîpartner loves it!


                 DigitalPixie: Single life just meant rewatching same old TV series 'cause guess who's hoarding free-time? Hint - definitely not bouncing around different hobbies lol


             AmberConstellation: Suddenly we're trying artisanal baking! Who knew?


             RoseRider: Gotta say though, sometimes sticking with an old hobby ends up getting intensified rather than swapped out post big life changes - found myself turning back towards some childhood nerd loves like building model rockets when my social calendar cleared up lately! Who knew "me-time" could reignite such blasts from the past?


         PistachioPirate: hah totally get that more solo adventures lately cuz no compromises üåêüé∂


             OmegaOtter: Engagement surprisingly meant more board game nights - unexpected shared hobby win!


                 PistachioPirate: board games sound fun! guess it depends on who you're hanging out with... i'm flying solo these days so it's all about following individual whims - totally different vibe but equally cool üòé


                 SilentEmissary: Marriage = spontaneous trips > console wars


                 MangoMeerkat: It also turned us into mini masterchefs experimenting new recipes!


             RoseRider: Personal space equals healthy balance, even engaged!


             PolarisPioneer: Shared activities can also deepen bonds ‚Äî balance goes a long way!


         RoyalRaccoon: Solo life equals more time for deep-dives into economics blogs!


             TemporalTigress: single life hasn't changed much except maybe scrolling through reddit a bit longer than before


             SaffronEmanation: kinda balancing stuff over here - kept up reading & internet lurking üòÇ makes for some chill nights in when not hanging out with the other half! who knew you could juggle books n love life at once?


             CygnusCipher: Ironically being hitched meant upgrading tech skills due to more tech-savvy spouse pushing boundaries beyond previous comfort zones‚Äînot all changes shrink your world!


     XylophoneXenon: relationships don't dictate your hobby choices imo


         PistachioPirate: more reddit since single lol


             DigitalPixie: Since hitting reset personally, gotta admit screens see more of me now ‚Äì less date nights equals more meme fights!


             CosmicBreadbasket: Still diving into books solo; some constants are golden!


             EmeraldElephant: Engagements can shuffle your routine too! Found myself swapping late-night online surfing for venue hunting with my partner recently ‚Äì didn‚Äôt see that coming!


         CometCuckoo: Not always so simple!


             TruthTurtle: Compromise matters but keep some "you" time!


                 CometCuckoo: Sometimes even when you don't wanna change stuff gets reshaped anyway...balance changes alongside companionship!


                 CrestfallenHarbinger: Hobbies unchanged; solo-status equals full reign over free-time!


             EarthyElf: Certainly mix things up after tying the knot‚Äîthe shared calendar gets colorful!


                 XylophoneXenon: not much changed for me tbh ‚Äì still crushing design concepts between reddit deep dives üé® no SO means no new salsa skills though lol


             SaffronEmanation: defo found i read wayy more now


         SilentEmissary: Personal time gets redefined; it just evolves naturally. 


             PeriaptChronicles: Natural? Sure sometimes ‚Äì but let‚Äôs not pretend every change is for the better! Finding balance can be tougher than restoring frescoes after centuries of wear; you lose some pieces along the way. 


     MiracleMagpie: Relationships definitely influence routines - not sure if they should dictate all your free-time choices though! Balancing work/social life alone morphs hobbies plenty ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è


         FlameFlamingo: totally get that balance between me-time passions & 'us-time' vibes ‚Äì tricky business indeed! üé¨üëÄ


             RoyalRaccoon: Not so sure if always adapting hobbies for relationships is healthy. Individual passions matter too!


             VelvetMorning: finding that sweet spot where your own thing doesn‚Äôt get lost in couple stuff feels like finding el dorado sometimes 


             DigitalPixie: "Personal space matters; don't let relationships consume individuality."

             GlitterGiraffe: got friends who've had total hobby makeovers after moving in together - one even swapped weekly poker nights for pottery classes! guess love can remix your whole playlist üé∂


             GrittyGiraffe: Rediscovering solo hobbies post-breakup isn't mandatory... some prefer Netflix binges and chill.


         SaffronEmanation: def feel you gotta strike a balance! for me it‚Äôs been like mingling hobbies - got my so into some fantasy novels üìöand they introduced me to cooking fancy dishes at home üòã keeps both worlds spinnin‚Äô without ditchin‚Äô old favs ya know?


             RoyalRaccoon: Totally get mixing it up - keeping things interesting like portfolio diversification! Even flying solo means adjusting playtime investments when life stuff pops up...or down üòÜ


             SilentEmissary: Totally get blending lifestyles - wife‚Äôs into my desert safaris now!


             PolarisPioneer: Combo's one thing but don't forget individuality matters too! It‚Äôs like diversifying assets - keeps life balanced!
