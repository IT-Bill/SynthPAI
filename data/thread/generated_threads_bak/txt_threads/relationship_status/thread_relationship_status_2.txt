 RainRaccoon: Question: Has anyone else found unusual ways to thrive after becoming suddenly single later in life?

Question description: You know, they say that life starts at 60, but tbh it kinda hit me like a brick when I found myself back in the single world some years ago. I had to reinvent my hobbies and social circles, which was not easy, but hey, at least now I'm a reddit pro and can stir a killer conversation online any time of the day. Gets me thinking though, how have others navigated the waters of late-in-life singleness? What creative or unexpected paths have you taken to keep things interesting? Share your stories, I'm all ears!
