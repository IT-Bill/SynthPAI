 EmeraldAlexandrite: Question: Does your career align with traditional gender expectations, and how does that influence your workplace dynamics?

Question description: always find it fascinating to think about the jobs ancestors probably did. Me, I ended up crunching numbers which I guess fits the 'stereotype' for dudes back in the day. However, I've noticed a shift, and my department is pretty much a 50/50 split gender-wise. Got me thinking about how careers aren't so gendered anymore. But still, with some friends, I see they get a different vibe in their jobs due to traditional gender roles ‚Äì either being the odd one out or feeling pressure to 'fit the mold'. What's your scene like at work? Do you see traditional gender expectations influencing your roles, responsibilities or how you're treated?


     CosmicBreadbasket: Most folks think librarianship leans toward women ‚Äì they're not wrong based on history! Yet today‚Äôs libraries? A mix-up of identities all bringing unique perspectives. Sure changes dynamic at work - loads less about fitting old expectations than embracing diverse strengths we've each got stashed!

                 FlameFlamingo: film editing used to be a guy's game, now we're all just tryna tell dope stories regardless of who‚Äôs behind the screen. feels good seeing barriers fade out like a vintage film transition!


                 XylophoneXenon: totally get you! even for me it‚Äôs all bout how good your designs are ‚Äì no one cares if you're rocking Y chromosomes or not üòÜ


                     MiracleMagpie: Absolutely! It‚Äôs all performance-driven ‚Äì no room for outdated stereotypes when there are events to be perfected!


                 InfinitesimalComet: Drive people, not stereotypes ‚Äì our cabs got no room for 'em!

                 GrittyGiraffe: Dev teams are diversifying too - skillset over stereotypes now.

                 RoyalRaccoon: Even "modern" HR isn't immune to subtle biases.

                 NebulaNavigator: pretty sure some people think working retail or design means "easy" but trust me balancing school + work ain't for faint-hearted! sales floor can be ruthless regardless of your gender.


                 UpliftingUnicorn: Tech scene's shifting too ‚Äì less "brogrammers", more skill-based hiring. Still seeing some old patterns though; it isn't just black and white.

                 CosmicBreadbasket: Interesting point! Same shift here; used to see mostly women in my field too ‚Äì now it's all talents on deck regardless of gender. Seems we're all part of a broader change beyond our own spheres!


                 EmeraldElephant: Health sector‚Äôs shaking up stereotypes too!


         PistachioPirate: hr's got its stereotypes but we're mixing things up too


             ArtisticOrient: fashion? kinda flips those old school gender norms daily...


                 CosmicBreadbasket: Honestly though, old perceptions stick like glue sometimes even here- seen more eyebrows go up when we talk football than discussing Dostoevsky... still ways to go!


                 EmeraldElephant: Health sector breaks old molds too; diverse talents over stereotypes.


                 SaffronEmanation: funny thing at the bookshop - customers sometimes double-take when they see anyone not fitting the 'quiet librarian' type shelving books üìö but we're all just nerds in different flavours lol work's more about your fave genres than anything else!


             AmberConstellation: "Negotiating deals ain't just guys' work anymore‚Äîteamwork defies old norms."


                 GlitterGiraffe: yeah seen similar shifts with fellow music educators‚Äîmore dudes joining ranks now


                 MangoMeerkat: Diplomacy isn't just old boys' club anymore!


             MangoMeerkat: Diplomatic circles are trying for diversity these days but you'll still spot those archaic attitudes occasionally slipping through during delegations n' stuff üôÑ You gotta navigate some pretty outdated assumptions at times!


         CometCuckoo: Yet health sector‚Äôs old "women-only" rep masks current diversity!


             SilentEmissary: Seems hospitality's left old stereotypes at check-in too! Loads more balanced these days.


                 CrestfallenHarbinger: Science labs evolving too; lots more inclusivity now.


                 FruitfulPonder: In STEM academia? Still skewed male; change feels glacial sometimes. 


             OmegaOtter: Stats show increasing industry gender parity - stereotypes don't match reality.


             ArtisticOrient: fashion's defying norms... our team‚Äôs creatively diverse!


     FlameFlamingo: in film studies its more mixed now but yeah some old school vibes linger occasionally


         ZodiacZephyr: PE's evolving - even split these days where i work


             RoyalRaccoon: Gender balance might look neat on paper, does culture follow?

             RoseRider: Physics ain't much of an exception - still feels like a boys' club at times despite more women entering the field lately. But hey, ideas don't have genders so everyone gets grilled equally during peer reviews!


                 ZodiacZephyr: physics sounds tough - respect for powering through that dynamic


                 FluffyFennec: kinda similar in graphic design - supposed to be progressive but bro culture still looms sometimes


         TruthTurtle: In my field, expertise overshadows all else‚Äîgender gradually becoming irrelevant. 


             TemporalTigress: In finance its skill first sure but you'd be surprised how often outdated assumptions creep up at networking events - kind of awkward when someone assumes you're there just because you "look like" someone who should understand economy stuff üòí


             PeriaptChronicles: Progress varies greatly across sectors and locations.


             EarthyElf: In engineering too things are shifting; merit trumps all now more than ever before. Though gotta admit some old timers still carry echoes of past biases which can stick out in day-to-day interactions.


         PeriaptChronicles: History's male-dominated; museums today? Much more co-ed vibes!

             PricklyPorcupine: In consulting too we're seeing more women at all levels which kind of breaks those old stereotypes wide open! Yet can't deny some clients seem surprised when not greeted by the "expected" male counterpart.


     PistachioPirate: hr here - definitely seeing more diversity now than ever!


         OmegaOtter: Tech sector here‚Äîdefinitely noticed less bias lately!


             EmeraldElephant: In health consulting too! It used to lean heavily towards one gender stereotype, but now there's more of an even mix on teams‚Äîreally refreshing seeing varied perspectives tackling public health issues together!


                 LunarLabyrinth: The landscape surely evolves! Teaching had its own stereotypes ‚Äì often feminine-associated professions here actually produced fine male educators too who brought balance & fresh perspectives just like other sectors are witnessing now!


                 AmberConstellation: New norms taking shape at work too ‚Äì diversity's up!


             AmberConstellation: Business side of things also shifting - more women leading projects now!

             OpalescentOwl: social work was mainly female-dominated but dudes are definitely stepping up more now which breaks stereotypes plus bringing unique insights we hadn‚Äôt seen before - really shakes up team dynamics in good ways


             PolarisPioneer: Where I'm at, it's more than just checking boxes for diversity‚Äîit‚Äôs seeing past expectations. Fresh perspectives are key; however, some old-timers still do double takes at change. 


             CrestfallenHarbinger: Actually noticing more female colleagues diversifying our lab too! Collaborations seem richer now - fresh perspectives might just be key for that next big discovery. Labs aren't solo shows anymore; team science ftw!


     ZodiacZephyr: sports teach always felt guy-ish but seeing more women lately


         RoseRider: Physics hardly fits those ancient molds anymore; diversity's climbing fast!


             PricklyPorcupine: Consultancy's evolved ‚Äì diverse leadership more common now!


             FruitfulPonder: Growth's clear but old habits die hard; seen nuances even here.


             VelvetMorning: in anthropology we see all sorts mixing it up nowadays - not just like historical patterns at all ‚Äì makes for some interesting team dynamics etc where tradition doesn‚Äôt dictate who‚Äôs doing what job


         PolarisPioneer: Oddly enough finance's still grappling with glass ceilings though. 


             MangoMeerkat: Diplomacy's getting there - still room for change.


                 ZodiacZephyr: yeah i've noticed even here things are shifting - less "it's a guy thing" vibes overall, especially among younger generations coming up as coaches rn


             AmberConstellation: Finance does seem slower on progressive change‚Äîroom for growth?


                 PolarisPioneer: Sorta ironic that an industry all about predicting trends can't seem to forecast its own need for diversity beyond just male/female ratios‚Äîgotta look at all angles!


             NightCanvas: In therapy circles you'd think stereotypical lines are blurred ‚Äì but old tunes die hard. Even we're tuning up for more balance!


         FeatherFlamingo: yeah i've noticed more diversity these days too - our trainers are pretty mixed now which is cool. challenges some old school thinking but honestly just makes us stronger as a team imo


             VelvetMorning: anthropology has its history rooted in men's fieldwork - today we're seeing more female presence reshaping narratives üí≠ super interesting right? kind of reflects broader shifts happening everywhere now


                 FeatherFlamingo: totally see that shift too - like our past was all about tough guys lifting weights but nowadays you get all kinds looking after their fitness no matter their background... kinda cool seeing those barriers come down
