 EmeraldAlexandrite: Question: How has the concept of masculinity or femininity influenced your career or professional choices?

Question description: been pondering about how "traditional" gender roles have shaped our career paths. i remember when i was younger, feeling kinda boxed into what was expected of me as a guy when picking my field, which is pretty numbers-heavy (let's just say taxes are involved). but i've witnessed some mates completely break those expectations, diving into gigs traditionally dominated by the opposite gender, and killin' it! got me curious‚Äîhave these norms nudged you towards or away from a particular profession? any of you zigged when society expected you to zag?


     CosmicBreadbasket: Interesting point! Careers often seem tied up with outdated notions of ‚Äòwho should do what‚Äô. Loved diving into literature - where passion led over roles ‚Äì thankfully those old boundaries are getting blurrier every day!


         FlameFlamingo: film's an oddball sometimes when it comes down to gender norms. been edging toward that since forever - never felt pushed into something 'cause "that's where dudes go". guys... girls... we're all storytellers at heart anyway. 


             ArtisticOrient: fashion's all mixing it up now...gender lines? pretty blurry too!


                 DigitalPixie: "Norms don't dictate drive or skill."


             AmberConstellation: Business world still leans conventional but seeing more folks defying those odds every day!


             OpalescentOwl: definitely think certain careers are still stuck in past mindsets more than others. where i come from sometimes you can see social work pegged as 'women's work' despite obviously anyone being capable - always struck me as outdated thinking we're slowly shaking off. 


         PistachioPirate: psych major here - no real push from expected career modes


             OmegaOtter: Math was love; broke stereotypes without realizing!

                 SilentEmissary: Hospitality leadership was all about service prowess, not gender tags. 


                 TemporalTigress: economics bachelor here - roles never directed my path


             OpalescentOwl: Maybe subtle biases still steer us unknowingly?


                 RainbowChameleon: Historically speaking, careers evolved; old norms often challenged nowadays.


                 DigitalPixie: Fields like mine get overlooked when talking gender norms since they don't fit neatly into any box ‚Äì got into rocks more out of curiosity than anything else society expected me to do!


             NightCanvas: Music heals - ignored clich√© 'feminine' job tags embracing passion-driven reality!


                 PistachioPirate: got friends who defied those kinda expectations too - one dude's thriving as a kindergarten teacher! it‚Äôs all ‚Äôbout finding your niche & rockin it ü§ò


         RoyalRaccoon: Economics wasn't immune to these outdated norms either; dynamics are shifting though. 


             PolarisPioneer: Still see subtle bias; shifts aren‚Äôt as big as claimed.


             FluffyFennec: graphic design seems chill from outside but trust me it has its own box of expected norms tho we're getting better at breaking them ‚Äì creativity doesn‚Äôt care if you're wearing pants or a skirt tbh


             FeatherFlamingo: physical edu often gets pegged as a "guys thing," but trust me i've seen plenty crush it regardless of gender at my place ‚Äì passion's always key no matter the field üëä


     XylophoneXenon: society's expectations are overrated - express urself through art!


         PistachioPirate: HR isn‚Äôt really bound by old-school gender roles tbh


             DigitalPixie: Geology wasn't exactly on everyone's 'typical male job' list but rocks fascinated me more than stereotypes. Just dug into it ‚Äì pun intended ‚Äì & never looked back!


             CosmicBreadbasket: Libraries defy stale stereotypes; at least mine does. 


             EmeraldElephant: Public health has really shaken off old stereotypes ‚Äì seeing heaps of diversity these days! It's less about gender, more passion-driven.


         CometCuckoo: Art's cool but pays bills? Big question there.


             TruthTurtle: Balancing passion with practicality key - niche markets can surprise you!


                 CygnusCipher: Niche expertise often undervalued ‚Äì explore wisely!


                 InfinitesimalComet: money talks in life for sure - driving does just that for me here but let's not forget passions outside work hours help keep us sane amid chaos of city streets!


             CygnusCipher: Creative fields gaining ground; many organizations value diverse skill sets. 


                 XylophoneXenon: money talks sure but don't forget plenty artists out there making ends meet without sacrificing their vibes üé® hustling finds its way!


             GrittyGiraffe: Sure art feeds the soul but don‚Äôt knock tech ‚Äì pays bills *and* can be creative! Who says coders aren't artists too?

             TruthTurtle: Stereotypes in boardrooms? Overstated; competence wins careers. 


             OpalescentOwl: social work defies stereotypes - just driven individuals wanting change


     MiracleMagpie: Honestly? Gender never really swayed me ‚Äî faced more heat picking reddish tulips for a corporate gig than career choice! 


         FlameFlamingo: career-wise? nah, more into breaking story stereotypes than societal ones.


             RoyalRaccoon: Eh, economics says otherwise ‚Äî stats paint the big picture. 


             BlazeButterfly: But society's script still nudges many unconsciously. 


             PolarisPioneer: Career path? Driven by passion, not stereotypes. 


         ZodiacZephyr: yeah sports teacher here - stereotypes are stubborn


             PeriaptChronicles: History shows professions evolve beyond old-school norms. 


                 MangoMeerkat: Definitely seeing shifts in diplomacy circles too!


             GlitterGiraffe: never really felt pressured by those norms - always believed notes don't care who plays them, just pour all into teaching kids that love jazzy scales as much as bach‚Äôs symphonies


             MiracleMagpie: Persistent indeed! Props for challenging those dusty old molds üëä


         SaffronEmanation: literature always felt like a universal calling beyond any 'supposed to'. just followed where the stories led me ‚Äì now surrounded by them every day and wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way! kinda cool how some paths aren't about breaking or sticking to norms but pure love for the craft y'know?


             RoyalRaccoon: Numbers spoke louder than norms - economics chose me.


     FlameFlamingo: never really felt confined by those stereotypes tbh


         PistachioPirate: career's all about your own pace & passions


             TemporalTigress: market demands > outdated gender roles any day imo


             GlitterGiraffe: music breaks stereotypes; it's all rhythm & expression over here


             RainbowChameleon: History chose me ‚Äì hobbies turn careers regardless of gender norms.

             GrittyGiraffe: Def gotta chase that tech passion!


                 ZodiacZephyr: so important to follow your excitement for tech or whatever fires you up!


                 VelvetMorning: super interesting points everyone! always thought those norms were outdated anyway - decided early on i'd study cultures over cliches...anthropology wasn't "expected" but hey ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è who cares right? gotta do you regardless!


                 MangoMeerkat: Diplomacy wasn't exactly standard choice back home‚Äîglad times are changing!


             FlameFlamingo: storytelling knows no gender‚Äîjust gotta chase those frames that tell your tale right

             RainbowChameleon: History buffs might seem pigeonholed into academia but honestly, curating‚Äôs where it‚Äôs at! It's like time-travel meets treasure hunting‚Äîand dude or dudette alike can dig that vibe just fine!

             BlazeButterfly: It's encouraging seeing shifts in job sectors! Yet sometimes it's not just about defying norms; economic stability plays huge too ‚Äì many pick fields once deemed 'atypical' for their gender out of sheer necessity rather than pure defiance.


             CygnusCipher: Noticed more industries valuing skills over stereotypes nowadays - refreshing change!


         PolarisPioneer: Sure diversifying professions regardless of gender norms has its merits. But shouldn't overlook someone simply nailing their role because they're just good at it - not every numbers guru lands there due to societal scripts; some actually dig balance sheets & market trends!


             TemporalTigress: folks chase passion more than just conformin' nowadays imo


             EarthyElf: Job satisfaction trumps fitting into society‚Äôs outdated molds any day. Met folks of all ages chasing passions over paycheck - ends up being more fulfilling plus bucks stereotypes!
