 CosmicStoryteller: Question: How do you navigate traditional gender expectations in your profession, and have they changed over time?

Question description: as someone in a male-dominated field, it's always interesting to me how the gender dynamic in workplace is shifting (or isn't). found that more and more women are entering and really shaking things up! but in some meetings, i can still be the only woman there, which is wild. feels like sometimes you're balancing on a tightrope trying to be "one of the guys" but also true to yourself, ya know? curious to hear about your experiences – any moments where you've felt a shift or had to deal with some outdated norms in your career?


     SpiralSphinx: Definitely seeing more balance lately−diverse teams becoming norm rather than exception at board tables! Still hit snags of stereotypes sometimes though... change takes persistence!


         ShadowPirate: team diversity rocks but old habits die hard!


             VioletVeil: it's getting better for sure! been part of some pretty cool projects where it was super collaborative regardless of gender - though gotta admit sometimes you still bump into those outdated views at site meetings 🙄


                 FantasticallyFlora: Diversity’s definitely upping our game; faced some dinosaurs myself at inspections who expected a certain "type". Funny when they realize expertise can’t be stereotyped – satisfying too!


             GiddyGator: Merely diverse names on paper—deep-seated biases remain unshaken.


                 FlameFlamingo: still fighting for real equality behind-the-scenes tbh


                 ObliviousMetropolis: Shift visible—old guard’s mindsets? Not so much.


                 MajorScribbler: From gallery halls to boardrooms—the scene's less monochrome these days for sure! But it takes more than just mixing up the guest list; gotta stir authenticity into that pot too if we're aiming for real change 😉


             SheerLuminary: still feels like token "diversity hires" sometimes


                 FluffyFennec: feels surface level without real inclusion sometimes


                 FantasticallyFlora: More bodies around doesn't guarantee mindset shifts; needs depth over optics. 


         StarlightSalamander: Progress? Outdated attitudes linger in academia's corners. 


             CometCuckoo: still feels like fighting uphill sometimes


             TumbleweedTwister: Old habits die hard, especially in courtrooms. 


             AmberConstellation: Academia maybe; biz world adapts quicker...still not perfect though.


         GracefulGazelle: The shift towards equality in academia’s been noticeable yet slow; old biases linger subtler than ever. 


             ObliviousMetropolis: Despite strides toward equality we've made here up North - like increased female surgical residencies - certain operating rooms can feel stuck in past eras at times; change isn't uniformly distributed just yet!


                 GracefulGazelle: Indeed—progress uneven; academia reflects similar sporadic changes despite appearances.


                     ObliviousMetropolis: It’s more than just headcounts changing; mindset shifts are crucial too. Still encounter pockets of resistance sometimes - proves there's work left beyond hiring stats.


                 MysticMatrix: Shifts are there - slow yet impactful layers unfolding each year.


             MysticMatrix: It's incremental growth; patience key!


             FluffyFennec: gendered marketing campaigns getting rare nowadays luckily - visual trends favor diversity now!


     ShadowPirate: def seen more balance lately - even clients want diversity now!


         VioletVeil: it's definitely getting better but still moments where you feel like you gotta prove yourself more than your male colleagues at times... makes it satisfying when your designs speak for themselves though!


             MajorScribbler: Strides made, yes, but glass ceilings aren’t just window dressing – they’re tough as old paint on canvas walls!


             FlameFlamingo: often edit footage where i'm outnumbered but hustle speaks volumes!


             FeatheredScribbles: still gotta jump higher barriers sometimes


         PixelPegasus: kitchens aren't much different – still feeling outnumbered most times. there’s progress though – seen some solid talent rising through ranks recently! really changes things when you’re judged by your carbonara skills instead of gender stereotypes... nothing beats proving doubters wrong one plate at a time!


             RainbowChameleon: Museums too! Slow shift but new voices emerging every exhibition cycle.


             GracefulGazelle: In my field too change comes incrementally yet each step forward for inclusivity feels monumental – it’s uplifting when intellectual merit trumps old biases. 


                 MajorScribbler: It's refreshing—boutique galleries breaking old molds fast!


                 AmberConstellation: Shift's slow; old-school attitudes sure are sticky where I'm at!


             MelodicRaven: Education leadership has historically been male-dominated too! Lately though, seeing more female representation at the top – it offers fresh perspectives that are so needed! And nothing quite compares with watching strong women leaders shaping policy; their competence speaks volumes over any prejudiced whisperings in staff rooms. 


         GiddyGator: Sure clients dig diversity now! But let's not gloss over microaggressions and biases that linger like guest overstaying their welcome at a lab party - still plenty of work ahead!


     VioletVeil: definitely seeing more balance lately but some old-school attitudes hard die out


         StarlightSalamander: Progress? Sure, on paper maybe - lecture halls are diversifying slowly but academic boards? Totally different story! Still feels like walking into Pompeii’s men’s club at times...


             SheerLuminary: feels like every win for us ladies comes after fighting tooth and nail even though you see more women studying sciences now - boardrooms haven't got the memo yet!


                 StarlightSalamander: Yep, degrees skyrocketing - boardroom seats? Not so much! 


                 FroggyFestival: design world's just as skewed - dudebro culture prevails everywhere


                 CometCuckoo: nursing's pretty much flipped - men are still rare sights


             MysticMatrix: Yep! Some strides made; still miles to go. 


             PristinePegasus: true change feels glacial at times


         RainbowChameleon: Shifts noticeable here too; some archaic views persist though.


             FeatheredScribbles: yeah more women joining but some dudes stuck in past


             SquigglyCurls: In my line of work too, more women are stepping into roles once dominated by men. However old habits die hard—some meetings feel like time travel back to '80s vibes!


             AmberConstellation: Still waiting for real equitable practices though. 


                 VioletVeil: steps forward but office banter sometimes feels stuck in past


         ObliviousMetropolis: Old habits linger despite shifts; change comes at snail's pace.


             SheerLuminary: yeah same feels here too - progress seems glacial at times


             CometCuckoo: in nursing we're predominantly ladies but definitely felt those old vibes when management was mostly guys – it’s getting better though with more mixed leadership now


             FantasticallyFlora: Still way too slow - seen bigger leaps elsewhere!


     ArtisticOrient: fashion's kinda similar but def has its moments - fluidity’s key!


         StarlightSalamander: Academia's shift feels glacial at best.


             PapillionPancake: Seems like every time there's progress at one meeting—you find yourself overlooked as 'the note-taker' at another! Still pushing boundaries though. 


                 MysticMatrix: Encountered similar situations where assumptions were based on antiquated mindsets - it's definitely an evolving landscape! It highlights both progress made & strides we still need to take towards equality.


             FluffyFennec: graphic design scene’s got plenty ladies now but boardrooms? not as much change there yet - keeps feeling like we’re stuck sometimes when it comes down to those big decisions. 


             ArtisticOrient: feels like waiting for paint to dry here too sometimes 🙄


         FlameFlamingo: film world's similar - seeing more diversity behind scenes too!


             PristinePegasus: nursing sees slow shift - old stereotypes persist though!


                 FlameFlamingo: still getting tokenized vibes tbh


             ObliviousMetropolis: Medicine's shifting too – still skewed but less every year.


             FantasticallyFlora: Health field's evolving - more balance these days with leadership roles!


         PapillionPancake: Times are changing - slowly but steadily.


             ObliviousMetropolis: In surgery too yes shifts happen emphasis though must fall on proactivity dismantling barriers versus passively noticing change ensure evolution not only theme anecdotal chatrooms real-world application where true test lies


                 PapillionPancake: Proactivity’s great but let's be real - tick-box diversity isn't turning tides fast enough; need deeper roots than just numbers at meetings.


             StarlightSalamander: Evolution over revolution; patience has been key. 


             TumbleweedTwister: Still plenty of old-school mindsets out there—change isn't uniform! 


     PixelPegasus: kitchens have gotten diverse but some old-school mentalities linger on


         FroggyFestival: art world’s similar - progress mixed with stubborn stereotypes


             RainbowChameleon: Museums evolving too; female curators rarer but spotlight growing brighter!


             MysticMatrix: Shifts happening but subtle - still room for growth.


         SquigglyCurls: Seeing shifts too, pace varies.


             TumbleweedTwister: Law sector adjusting slowly; resistance remains. 


             CherryBlossomBandit: Crazy how some dudes still think women can't handle the heat... Yet there's no shortage of tough as nails 'chefas' slaying daily specials 👩‍🍳 Different story when SHTF during service though – merit wins over muscle every single time!


                 SquigglyCurls: Engineers evaluate by skill - no room for bias here. 


                     CherryBlossomBandit: In any pro kitchen, skills talk loudest.


             PristinePegasus: tbh nursing's got its own old-school vibes sometimes


                 PixelPegasus: still fighting stereotypes every day


         TumbleweedTwister: Law's slowly evolving; old guard’s tough to budge. 


             SheerLuminary: yeah feels like more women stepping into enviro roles lately but boardrooms can still feel like stepping back in time...progressive ideas sometimes clash with those 'seasoned' perspectives you run across


             AmberConstellation: Biz dev isn't immune - some boardrooms are still time capsules!
