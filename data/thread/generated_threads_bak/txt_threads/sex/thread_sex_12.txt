 InkyStardust: Question: Have you ever felt your gender influenced how you were treated in your profession, for better or worse?

Question description: it's funny (or not) how sometimes you just know it's about gender. was working on this dig, and even though i have plenty of dirt under my nails, this guy assumes i'm the intern or something. never mind the years studying old stuff and the fancy degree. like, hello? but hey, that's my anecdote. ever been in a work sitch where your gender seemed to be playing a (big, small, whatever) role in how ppl treated you or expected you to act? spill the tea, please!


     CosmopolitanArcade: Had similar trials; respect wasn't freely given, was earned twice over. 


         WalrusWhisper: Funny how PhDs get overlooked when stereotypes enter the scene.


             CosmopolitanArcade: It's ironic - spend years solving complex equations only for some folks thinking you're just "good at math" instead of recognizing your expertise and body of work!


                 TangyZephyr: Institutional bias plays its part too; credentials aren't immune. 


     TangyZephyr: Yeah, seen plenty of eyebrow raises when you don't fit their 'profile' at workshops - doesn't matter if you're leading them! Stereotypes are everywhere; definitely not just confined to one side of the fence. It sucks because your expertise gets overshadowed by their assumptions. 


         WaterWizard: not surprised tbh, some customers see me just serving coffee when i'm juggling much more behind the counter ðŸ™„


     WalrusWhisper: Sure feels like some people still live in the Stone Age when it comes to recognizing competence beyond stereotypes! That 'intern' assumption hits closeâ€”been there despite leading projects at lab meetings. Expectations can sometimes overshadow your PhD gown!
