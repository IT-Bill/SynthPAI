 MelodicRaven: Question: Redditors, how have your expectations of gender roles evolved over time?

Question description: i remember back in the day how there were these pretty rigid ideas about what guys and gals were 'supposed' to do, like it was straight outta some 1950s sitcom, ya know? but growing up, and especially while working in education, i've seen attitudes shift quite a bit. still feels like we've got a ways to go though. lately, i've been wondering how everyone's perspectives on gender roles have changed. Have ya noticed a shift in your own thinking or in the community around you? Let's hear some stories - have any of these changes impacted your life decisions or career path?


     DewyDaffodils: definitely seeing more diversity at job sites lately - both good progress for us.


         CosmicChroma: more women at work but equal pay? still not seeing it


             KeysOfAeolus: More ladies at markets too - wages still lagging though.


                 CosmicChroma: even biz admin studies show glaring gaps - frustrating times


                 ShadowPirate: seen similar trends in marketing too but leadership roles? kinda rare


             FroggyFestival: still feels like tokenism sometimes instead of actual change


                 CosmicChroma: looks progressive till you hit glass ceilings


             SeaSerpentShadow: Hello everyone! Significant strides indeed; reminds me of changes post-WWII when wartime norms challenged traditional expectations‚Äîyet wage gaps show some attitudes linger like specters from past eras. 


         ShimmerShark: Noticed similar trends - inclusivity's up within our teams too!


             GiddyGator: Physics teams are also becoming more diverse nowadays.


             WhisperWanderer: tbh despite strides made we're still seeing stereotypes in tech gigs - folks assume coders are guys. slow progress imo.


             FroggyFestival: ok but let's be real, some fields still gotta catch up, like creators' scenes can talk diversity all they want but it doesn't always show... more action less lip service pls


         EmeraldElephant: Noticed big changes in public health sectors too! Diversity's making teams stronger - thinking more broadly leads to better problem-solving for everyone's benefit.


             RoseRider: Still uneven progress - academia can lag behind!


                 DewyDaffodils: academia‚Äôs slow but construction's shaking off old stereotypes too


             EdgeEagle: Even within schools, old mindsets can persist amidst advancements; always room for growth!


             ZenZebra: Tech's evolving too; more diverse voices are definitely enriching our field!


     MoonbeamMoose: Nature never sticks to strict role plays - humans shouldn't either.


         MysticMatrix: Stereotypes break down when you talk less, listen more.


             AzureAlchemy: In my time leading schools, saw strict 'girl/boy things' limit kids‚Äô potential. Mixing it up opened doors‚Äîvital we keep doing so!


                 CelestialBard: gender fluidity's gaining ground here too - school curriculums slowly adapting üëç


                 QuirkyQuasar: Robots don't care about your gender ‚Äì neither should we. 


                 RaspberryRobin: Definitely seen shifts during lab work too‚Äîdiverse teams solving problems way better!


             ShimmerShark: Schools today champion skill over stereotype!


                 QuirkyQuasar: Watching peers defy norms daily inspires change! Witnessing girls code and boys design fashion‚Äîdoesn't get better than talent over typecasts. 


                 ParrotParadise: schools maybe but work life? not so much


             MellowMandrill: oldschool dude here saw lots change firsthand


                 VioletVeil: workplace diversity reshaping creativity norms


                 FroggyFestival: people saying "listen more" but then creating noise when describing their 'new' views on genders ‚Äì seems like just repackaging old labels instead of tossing them out completly


         CosmicChroma: roles evolve sure but some old patterns stick hard


             CosmicBreadbasket: Seen it firsthand - traditional expectations still lurk in corners even amongst progressive strides. 


                 MidnightMandolin: Balancing act - some traditions resist change like vintage vinyls cling to their grooves.


                 KeysOfAeolus: In agribusiness too shifts happening - women taking lead isn't so unusual anymore though some folks still act surprised when they see it going down.


                 GlitterGlacier: In every tech team meeting there's sometimes an old-school head who mistakes assertiveness for aggression if not coming from a guy‚Äîtime for another update!


             FantasticallyFlora: Seen plenty change at grassroots - fewer 'musts' more 'can-dos'. Still encounter old-school mindsets though; shift‚Äôs real but slow as molasses.


                 ShimmerShark: In schools now seeing boys knitting & girls coding - progress!


             GlitterGlacier: Sure old habits die hard ‚Äì but even in engineering there‚Äôs slow shift seen. 


         WanderingWolf: still got stereotypes at work tho üôÑ


             FantasticallyFlora: Bias exists, but progress too!


             MellowMandrill: drove buses for years saw it all - women who could handle a bus like champs & guys with kindness that'd surprise you times are changing but old habits stick like chewing gum under seats


                 WanderingWolf: yet schools still push old norms üò§


             CosmicCougar: Def not immune running a small biz either - seen all sorts of expectation dodging!


     MysticMatrix: Society‚Äôs evolving but some workplaces lag behind.


         StarrySplatter: even game dev has these probs‚Ä¶ frustrating tbh


             MidnightMandolin: In academics too there‚Äôs pushback against traditional molds ‚Äì theory often embraces fluidity but practice... another story! Gender norms are stubborn residents in institutional walls indeed. 


                 AzureAlchemy: The academic arena often praises innovation yet clings tightly to old scripts‚Äîa classic "easier said than done" predicament! Even after retirement, witnessing these tug-of-war dynamics between new ideologies and established practices makes you wonder which lessons truly stick...


                 LuminousLizard: seems every generation rewrites rules slowly


                 VioletVeil: it‚Äôs definitely tricky out there - i‚Äôve seen shifts first-hand where diverse designs are encouraged but old-school team dynamics sometimes play catch-up still üò¨


             EdgeEagle: Teaching kids now openly challenges old stereotypes.


         MidnightMandolin: Academia's pushing boundaries, more fluidity than corporate sectors.


             CosmicCougar: Small biz sees both sides of coin‚Äîold norms & new waves. 


             ZestfulZebra: even in science we're starting to see less rigid gender expectations


             GracefulGazelle: Even within academia‚Äôs progressive environment, old stereotypes persist among colleagues and administrative policies‚Äîstill room for improvement!


         WanderingWolf: but yeah some fields like politics? slow as snails


             CosmicCougar: Running a shop lets me see firsthand how diverse teams outperform old school 'boys club' mentalities every day! It's more than high time others caught up with us here. 


             WhisperWanderer: tech sector seems ahead with remote work & flex hours pushing equality but still gotta watch for those subtle biases lurking around. 


             CosmicBreadbasket: Definitely noted these trends affecting academic circles too.


     StarrySplatter: gender norms definitely shifting in our industry too ‚Äì feels progressive


         RainbowRambler: Still tech stereotypes abound sadly.


             QuirkyQuasar: Stereotypes persist despite progress‚Äîcan confirm. 


                 ShimmerShark: Teachers actively challenge these old-school norms nowadays yet some outdated views stick like gum under desks‚Äîincredibly stubborn!


                 GracefulGazelle: Academia sees similar trends; slow but discernible change. 


             ParrotParadise: still plenty biases around here


                 StarrySplatter: biases exist but seeing more inclusivity at dev cons lately


                 RainbowRambler: Change needs serious acceleration here.


                     ParrotParadise: slow progress sucks when your paycheck's laughable compared


             SeaSerpentShadow: Witness similar patterns across decades‚Äîcycles indeed.


         CosmicBreadbasket: Witnessed more women authors being studied lately. 


             ShimmerShark: Seeing more girls into STEM subjects at school nowadays!


             EdgeEagle: Seeing curriculums include diverse authors now - refreshing change!


             RaspberryRobin: Laboratories way more diverse now. 


         FantasticallyFlora: In public health too! Seen lots more men nursing lately ‚Äì breaks old stereotypes & benefits everyone by adding diversity & new perspectives!


             WhisperWanderer: tech‚Äôs way more mixed now - cool seeing varied dev teams!


             RaspberryRobin: Chem labs getting diverse too - very cool times!


             CelestialBard: noticed similar trends - even academia isn't immune


     SeaSerpentShadow: Observations over decades reveal shifts towards merit-based opportunities regardless of gender‚Äîechoes perhaps from when Enlightenment thinkers began challenging traditional hierarchies; similar undercurrents undoubtedly navigate today‚Äôs educational spheres.


     CosmicChroma: gender roles still holding strong here, just look at job ads.


         ZenZebra: Tech sector‚Äôs just as bad ‚Äì programmer stereotypes galore. 


             LuminousLizard: nah i gotta disagree here - sure some fields are making strides but overall? tons of outdated expectations still getting shoved on kids at school every day despite all our 'progress'.


             ParrotParadise: definitely see less diversity at coding meetups vs other fields


             VioletVeil: architecture isn't all drawing boards and hard hats anymore - often caught breaking norms 'cause digital innovation doesn‚Äôt care for old-school blueprints or builders' tea stereotypes!


         QuirkyQuasar: Actually seeing more guys venture into design nowadays doesn‚Äôt mean tech‚Äôs old-school norms got rebooted overnight ‚Äì especially in some circles where circuit boards still equal 'boys' club.'


             ShadowPirate: yeah def notice shifts at work too, even clients expect diverse teams now which signals change beyond just job ads or any single field 


             LuminousLizard: noticing way more diverse faces among students these days which is cool but those career stereotypes? they're tough nuts, not gonna crack easily - some parts never change i guess


         GracefulGazelle: Job ads? True, but academia's changing faster!


             ShadowPirate: noticed even in marketing there's more balance these days - was used to seeing certain types skew one way but now getting pitches across all boards that's defying old norms. pretty refreshing change tbh!


             FantasticallyFlora: Definitely seen more diversity protocols at play recently!


             VermillionVulture: In urban development circles, seeing more diversity lately ‚Äì leadership roles too!
