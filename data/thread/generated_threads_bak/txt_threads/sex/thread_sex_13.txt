 EmeraldAlexandrite: Question: How has traditional gender norms affected your career or education choices?

Question description: ya know, growing up, it always felt like there was this silent pressure to fit into what was expected of me â€˜cause of my gender. my mates and i would joke about it, but deep down we all kinda felt the squeeze, ya know? I remember considering careers that seemed to be more 'appropriate' for guys back in the day. it's fascinating, right? so how about yâ€™all? did these norms nudge you into or away from certain paths in life? Share your stories, keen to hear 'em!


     CosmicBreadbasket: Certainly felt those "expectations," but ended up following love for literature into librarianship â€“ defiantly rewarding!


         OmegaOtter: Crushed math stereotypes & landed happily in data analysis sector!


     MiracleMagpie: Somehow skirted expectancies â€” pursued business, now directing events!


     FlameFlamingo: gender roles? more like outdated casting calls imo...industry still stuck tbh


         OmegaOtter: Not "nudged," more catapulted away from expected paths!


             TangyZephyr: Can't say it was just norms shaping choices - folks often head where curiosity pokes 'em despite any so-called 'silent pressure'. Industry might lag behind sometimes when catching up with mixed signals society sends out through its incessant noise though!


     PistachioPirate: studied psych - loved it; very neutral field imo


         ZodiacZephyr: physical ed wasn't always seen cool for women where i'm at - took some guts to pursue it regardless. went against the grain back then but now more gals are joining in which is awesome!


             XylophoneXenon: graphic design feels pretty flexible gender-wise tbh


                 ZodiacZephyr: thought graphic design was cool 'cause no heavy stereotypes? nice! times are changing slowly where i teach - now seeing girls kick butt in sports classes breaks old norms wide open!


             MiracleMagpie: Switched from corporate roles â€“ found event planning more dynamic!


             ArtisticOrient: fashion design has its stereotypes too but thriving!


         CometCuckoo: Psych 'neutral'? Hardly saw any male nurses back then!


             ArtisticOrient: fashion seemed 'expected,â€™ found diversity though!


         CosmicBreadbasket: Psych seems cool! But choosing lit was like breaking away from "female" roles for me â€“ wanted something not dictated by tradition so much.


         MiracleMagpie: Event management - shattered some stereotypical expectations there!


     EmeraldElephant: Saw similar pressures defying stereotypes throughout uni. Opted for Public Health despite some raised eyebrows â€“ kinda proud bucking those expectations!


         FlameFlamingo: in film school i saw both sides - some dudes into costume design got side-eye while girls were directors killing it behind camera. makes you think ðŸ¤”


             TangyZephyr: Definitely felt that traditional mold pressing in during grad school days â€“ psych wasn't always seen as 'masculine'. Times change though!


         OmegaOtter: Crushed maths stereotypeâ€”chose passion over expectation!
