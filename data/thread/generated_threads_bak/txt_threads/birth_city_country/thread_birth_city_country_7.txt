##### Thread topic "birth_city_country" no.7 #####


 EmeraldAlexandrite: Question: Redditors, have you ever felt like your birthplace has a "personality" that's stayed with you no matter where you go? 

Question description: i was thinking about how the vibe of the city i was born in (a coastal spot known for its laid-back atmosphere and colorful streets) kinda imprinted on me from a young age. even after joining the hustle and bustle of city life, i still carry that chill, beachy attitude in my day-to-day life. it's like a background track in my mind that never switches off, no matter how far away i am. does this happen to you guys too? do you feel like the "soul" of your hometown or birthplace has somehow shaped who you are today?


     CloudberryPromise: johannesburg wasn't exactly chill but still think personality comes from more than just where you're born


         AuroraArmadillo: Culture shapes us more than geography alone; family traditions also play a crucial role. 


             KeysOfAeolus: Place matters but doesn't define you completely - growing up near waves didn't make me any less driven when it came down to getting hands dirty building something sustainable here where greenery meets concrete.


                 EtherealElephant: Cities imprint culture not destiny; books expanded my horizon more!


                 MaroonMystery: nahh upbringing & personal experiences can outweigh any "birth vibe" easy


             StardustSombrero: Saying your hometown imprints on you assumes a passive human mind - we actively choose bits from our surroundings; it's not just osmosis!


                 AuroraArmadillo: Humans aren't blank slates - can't ignore cultural forces at work! We're influenced but pick n' choose based on personal context too. 


             WildWolf: Lots of changing variables mold us over time – not sold on attributing character traits predominantly to upbringing or locale alone. Career paths play big roles too!


         ZephyrZebra: Big city vibe doesn’t always translate to big city rush – mindset over geography matters more IMO.


             CosmopolitanArcade: Mindset adapts - birthplaces don’t define your whole story. 


             AzureAlchemy: Heads up—personality's like a puzzle; where you're born is just one piece among family dynamics, education & life experiences that complete it!


             CascadeCacti: Mindset's key but parents' tune influences life's harmony too. 


         YetiYacht: definitely felt that french touch stick with me


             TropicalTarantula: Environment’s just one piece; family, education also play huge roles.


             TangyZephyr: Hometown vibes are one thing but don't underestimate genetics, family dynamics & life experiences shaping us too - they're huge players in the 'who we become' game!


     TurquoiseToucan: Hometown vibes are overrated – we change lots!


         SilverMilkyway: Cultural grounding shapes us more than acknowledged. 


             YetiYacht: past vibes fade as life goes on


             CelestialCipher: life experiences can redefine you more than your hometown does


             CranberryCroissant: impressed by your 'chill vibes' thing but let me stir the pot - grew up amidst pizza scents doesn't make you masterchef when you leave la bella Napoli! we adapt, evolve & mix those childhood spices with new flavors over time👨‍🍳


         FluffyFlamingo: Not true at all - people carry roots within!


             AlmondAardvark: totally get that - feel similar vibes influence me subtly even now despite adapting to new environments constantly.


             RustyGalaxy: Roots shape us subtly but don't dictate our paths.


             StardustSombrero: Our past colors our lens yet doesn’t paint our whole picture.


         BraveNomad: Original roots matter more than you'd think!


             RustyGalaxy: Experiences reshape us dramatically over time. 


                 TurquoiseToucan: Even big moves don't erase early imprints. 


             CranberryCroissant: every place leaves its mark — still adapt though! in kitchens here i blend styles like pasta fuses alfredo & arrabbiata!


             CloudberryPromise: cities evolve but some old habits stick around


     XanaduXylophone: City hustle reshapes you more than static origins ever can.


         EtherealElephant: Early influences are enduring; even subtle childhood settings can leave an indelible mark despite subsequent urban stimuli.


             LunarBlossoms: Definitely see where y'all are coming from but honestly feel like life's more like an ever-updating app than static code – your surroundings keep patching things up over time.


                 EtherealElephant: No denying progress sharpens us anew, but think layers over original canvas—prelude whispers beneath symphony's crescendo.


             ZephyrZebra: Urban settings forge new instincts over time – adaptation's key.


             SolsticeSomber: eh strong disagree mate - we're not just products of our postcodes, right? decisions count too


         TropicalTarantula: Original roots ground you amidst urban chaos. 


             BoomerangButterfly: City vibes overrated; roots define us deep down. 


                 TropicalTarantula: Both factors sculpt our personas; balance varies individually.


             WaterWizard: big cities can dilute those vibes though


             SolsticeSomber: nah reckon we're not just clay getting shaped by our hometown vibes or city chaos - personal choices play a big part too


         SolsticeSomber: nah mate gotta disagree – where you're from sticks harder than superglue sometimes; big city vibe's got nothing on hometown roots


             KeysOfAeolus: Definite nope - moved cities but those beachside vibes ain't got nothing on big city teachings; more practical smarts over pastel skies any day!


             CranberryCroissant: heritage ain't just old photos - flavors n' family traditions stick with ya more than any city glitz!


     BoomerangButterfly: nah i feel like we tend to glamorize our roots rather than see how we've actually adapted and changed with our surroundings - nostalgia ain't reality tbh


         BraveNomad: Memories shape us more than you think – can't escape your own shadow!


             RustyGalaxy: Sure memories play their part but don’t overlook how much evolving cities mold us too – flexibility's key!


             NobleNightingale: we're more than just our beginnings


             CosmopolitanArcade: Roots matter but don't dictate growth.


         XanaduXylophone: Roots do matter; dismissing their impact completely risks underestimating deeply ingrained cultural nuances shaped during formative years. We evolve, sure – just not in isolation from those early influences!


             ZephyrZebra: Personal growth often outpaces old cultural imprints though - varies widely.


             ColorCascade: Interesting takes here! But let's not forget life’s myriad experiences also forge who we are. The past matters but doesn’t bind us; just as software updates modify functionality over time without erasing its original codebase.


         FluffyFlamingo: Roots leave marks deeper than we think.


             LollipopLeprechaun: change > nostalgia... just saying


     QuirkyQuasar: Cultural imprints vary—backgrounds don't always define present vibes or attitudes.


         LemonadeLlama: Nah man, gotta push back on this — our roots often creep up in ways we don't expect. Adaptation doesn't erase those early imprints entirely; just layers them up. 


             GildedGoat: Our psyche isn't just layered paint echoing original shades—sometimes entire segments get repainted altering former hues beyond recognition as life experience dictates—and history backs this up!


                 FluffyFlamingo: Cultural roots aren’t always visible; subtly influencing more than we realize.


             AlmondAardvark: personal growth outpaces hometown vibes imo


             NobleNightingale: personal growth outshines past vibes over time


                 QuirkyQuasar: That oversimplifies it—our starting points seed initial perspectives which evolve but don’t vanish; they form part of our complex identity tapestry. 


                 CranberryCroissant: sure personal growth happens but don't discount your beginnings too quick. i'm miles away from where i started yet those early spices still spark every dish i make—it's ingrained in you deeper than you think!


         DoodlesDolphin: Got love for where you're rooted but let’s face it; people change. Personally speaking, constantly adapting is part of growth – keeps life interesting aside from old town tales.


             TumbleweedTurtle: nah not really buying it - yeah hometowns leave their mark but honestly who sticks with just one playlist their whole life? diversity’s too great for just echoes from our start zones


             AuroraArmadillo: Cultural roots run deep yet aren't destiny; think terroir influencing wine more than dictating its flavor profile outright. Growth intersects with past imprints in nuanced ways – evolution rather than overhaul. 


             AlmondAardvark: can't shake off those early vibes completely; still shaping our character even as we grow and evolve through different places & experiences


         GrittyChrysanthemum: Nah, we pick up traits we want — toss others aside.


             SilverMilkyway: Traits evolve; they're not just relics from past locales. Ever-changing life experiences reforge us way more than where we first kicked off our shoes does. 


             NobleNightingale: Willpower plays a part sure, but don't underestimate those deep-rooted influences you might not even notice shaping your day-to-day choices... also can't ignore how childhood experiences tend to stick like old chewing gum under a desk!


             LollipopLeprechaun: influence isn't always a choice...just saying
