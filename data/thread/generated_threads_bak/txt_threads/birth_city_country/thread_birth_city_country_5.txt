##### Thread topic "birth_city_country" no.5 #####


 MelodicRaven: Question: Expats and travelers of Reddit, how did your place of birth influence your expectations of other places you've visited?

Question description: So, there I was, backpacking through Europe, thinking every beach would be like the stretches back home — boy, was I in for a surprise! Turns out, the familiar coastlines I grew up with weren't the norm everywhere. Got me thinking about first impressions and expectations we carry from our hometowns. Have you ever been taken aback by how different a new place felt compared to the city or country where you were raised? Share your 'this is not what I expected' moment!


     DewyDaffodils: noticed massive cultural shifts more than landscape changes tbh


         MysticMatrix: Landscape shifts can deeply surprise too!


             LuckyLemur: Desert roots made lush greenery abroad astonishingly alien!


                 ZenZebra: Tech infrastructure variation was what caught me off guard!


                 VermillionVulture: Back home beaches are planned out for use + least environmental damage. Seeing some overseas spots felt unplanned was honestly baffling—even more than different trees or architecture!


                 FroggyFestival: where i'm from beaches aren't all sandy... mind-blowing!


             SeaSerpentShadow: Cultural shifts often reflect deep historical currents.


                 CosmicChroma: historical vibes totally shape our street norms too


                     MysticMatrix: History's cool but psyche adapts!


                 MidnightMandolin: Definitely found that social norms can trip you up more than anything else - like unwritten rules everyone follows but nobody tells you upfront!


                 FantasticallyFlora: Underestimated public services variation – sanitation levels caught me off-guard!


             ShimmerShark: Both aspects can catch you off-guard tbh!


                 EmeraldElephant: Often it’s not the scenery but varying health regulations abroad that really catch you off guard!


                 GracefulGazelle: Kulturschock ist real – city vibes differ wildly!


         CosmicChroma: cultural shifts are real eye-openers for sure


             WanderingWolf: administrative systems can be really baffling too!


                 EmeraldElephant: Healthcare admin differences are wild!


                 EdgeEagle: Tourist spots often gloss over local realities—service quality can differ wildly!


             QuirkyQuasar: Travel definitely throws curveballs at you. Growing up with iconic skylines didn't prepare me for small-town vibes elsewhere! The world seems smaller online though - gotta love that internet connect!


                 EdgeEagle: Each city whispers different stories. 


                     CosmicChroma: those "whispers" often lack real substance tho


                     QuirkyQuasar: History feels different everywhere you go!


                 ShadowPirate: small town charm can hit you weird when all you've known are crazy-busy streets - kind of flips your view upside down because those quiet spots don't match up with fast city life back home at all


                 MidnightMandolin: Travel sure broadens horizons - expected bustling cafés everywhere after years down cozy side streets in hometown haunts; instead found tranquil solitude overseas. Mind officially expanded!


             EmeraldElephant: Cultural adjustments hit hard during travels! Once expected an 'everywhere English' scenario — needed quick language skills upgrade instead! It’s not just signs and menus; it’s humor, gestures... whole communication style flips! 


                 FantasticallyFlora: Health regulation variances abroad are eye-openers too!


                 KeysOfAeolus: Totally feel it! Even marketplace bartering styles vary wildly abroad!


         RainbowRambler: Stark contrast - Midwest modesty versus Swiss efficiency struck me hard. 


             KeysOfAeolus: Traveling brings surprises; expected bustling markets & open spaces everywhere like back home - ended up finding cozy coffee shops instead!


                 FroggyFestival: always thought cities would feel similar - big reality check!


                 GlitterGlacier: Interesting perspective! Seen both sides - some places exactly echo hometown vibes while others toss those expectations right out the window!


                 GracefulGazelle: Coasts here contrast greatly; some beaches lack that open expanse – it’s all about cozy niches nested among historical backdrops. 


             ZestfulZebra: coastal hometown set high bar for natural beauty elsewhere


                 RainbowRambler: Miss those Great Lakes sunsets though!


             GracefulGazelle: Travel definitely broadens horizons! Once expected everywhere to share familiar academic enthusiasm like at home – quickly learned it's not always a universal thing ;)


                 EdgeEagle: Learned early - classroom dynamism doesn’t translate universally!


     LuckyLemur: Desert dunes vs sea waves - total reset!


         SeaSerpentShadow: Certain traditions can surprise even more than geography!


             WanderingWolf: sometimes those surprise traditions become fav memories!


                 EmeraldElephant: Travel spots can surprise you big time! Distinct eating habits messed up my routine – gotta adapt fast or risk completely throwing off your wellness groove!


                     SeaSerpentShadow: Adapting dining customs often unveils local history layers!


                 MidnightMandolin: Travel often unravels scripts we didn’t realize we had - like realizing smiling isn’t universal currency! Totally threw me off when some friendly grins were met with blank stares... makes you wonder what other 'norms' are actually just local quirks! 


             FantasticallyFlora: Health regs abroad differ hugely - eye-opener even for pros!


                 EdgeEagle: Local classroom dynamics vs international academic standards—worlds apart! What works teaching-wise back home often puzzles students (and teachers!) abroad big time!


                 RaspberryRobin: Totally get that! Working with labs makes you really notice how safety standards can vary. Traveling opens your eyes – like discovering not everywhere treats waste management the same way we do here – quite the learning curve!


             GlitterGlacier: Bavarian beer tents? Unexpected elegance abroad!


                 LuckyLemur: First Oktoberfest honestly threw me; felt like stepping onto another planet where time-honored rituals overrule daily hustle—even splurged on tradition-tinted souvenirs!


                 FroggyFestival: crazy how every city buzz feels unique too


         MidnightMandolin: Bike-friendly streets weren't universal – lesson learned!


             GlitterGlacier: The surprise was real when finding out not every city has an efficient public transit system - took some adjusting after relying heavily on it back home!


                 RaspberryRobin: Bus rides here? More like survival skills training!


             RaspberryRobin: Miss those beach town vibes; big city just ain’t the same!


             VermillionVulture: Cycling paths? More like obstacle courses!


         ParrotParadise: beaches full of people crammed like sardines totally threw me off – expected roomy sands


             ShadowPirate: overcrowded? ever seen kilyos mid-summer? nightmare fuel!


             ZenZebra: Metropolitan hustle completely differs from tranquil island vibes at home!


                 ParrotParadise: surprised city parks lack space too, where's all the greenery?


     CosmicChroma: definitely get you - thought massive malls were just typical until i saw some cozy downtowns abroad. makes you appreciate the little quirks from where you’re from and all those new vibes too!


         RainbowRambler: Coming from an urban jungle originally, finding super chill towns elsewhere flipped my script big time! Makes you really notice those subtle surprises that stick with you long after unpacking your bags back home. 


             ZestfulZebra: small town quiet feels eerie after always hearing traffic hums


         ShimmerShark: Big malls mask quaint old-world charm often overlooked at first glance!


             KeysOfAeolus: Not all beaches rival our coastlines either!


                 VioletVeil: seriously was thrown off when i realized some cities are pedestrian heaven - thought cars dominated everywhere like back at mine! urban planning surprises ftw!


             VioletVeil: malls never have that authentic vibe you get from those tiny boutiques tucked away in some alley. always feels like cookie-cutter shopping experience tbh... i'll take charming irregularity over retail giants any day!


             RaspberryRobin: Always thought nothing could beat our local ferias until visiting tight-knit marketplaces overseas – so much history in those cobblestone streets!


         VioletVeil: cities aren't cookie cutters anyway... always unique!


             CelestialBard: crowded here vs chill spaces overseas was eye-opening!


             FantasticallyFlora: Always mind-blowing how our start points set standards! Grew up amidst landlocked hustle then moved seaside - talk about contrast! Makes you treasure each place's special sorta magic though, right?


             KeysOfAeolus: Surprising diversity away from home shores!
