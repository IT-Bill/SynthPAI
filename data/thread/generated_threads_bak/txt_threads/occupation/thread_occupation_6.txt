 EmeraldAlexandrite: Question: What profession clich√©s have you found to be surprisingly accurate or hilariously off the mark?

Question description: So the other day we were having this debate at work about the stereotypes associated with different professions. You know, accountants being 'bean counters' and stuff. It was a laugh because I found some to be spot on, while others are clearly pulled from outer space. Made me wonder about the clich√©s from other fields. Have you guys found any clich√©s in your line of work that made you go "Yep, that's us" or maybe some that had you rolling your eyes to the moon and back? Share the good, the bad, and the utterly bizarre!

                 SilentStellar: Talk about 'expected coffee addiction'... Jokes aside though we're more hands-on problem solvers than just theory heads!
