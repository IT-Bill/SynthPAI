 EmeraldAlexandrite: Question: How has your field of study from university affected your world view or career trajectory?

Question Description: just reflecting back to my uni days, and it's crazy how much those years have influenced my thinking & career path. went into it thinking I’d just crunch numbers but ended up with a whole new perspective on how businesses shape our world. plus, the friendships and mentorships have been invaluable. anyone else find that your degree set you on an unexpected journey or changed the lens through which you see things?


     CosmopolitanArcade: Degrees help but real life teaches more!


         TangyZephyr: Sure, degrees frame your mind but hitting life’s curveballs? That teaches adaptability like nothing else – classroom theories don’t always hit home until you're fielding them live!


     WaterWizard: film school vibes different - doesn't always match reality tho


         WalrusWhisper: Academic rigor doesn't always translate into real-world success; lab results differ vastly from industrial applications!


         CosmopolitanArcade: Math theory isn't job training – surprised pikachu face!


             WaterWizard: yeah feels like all theories crumble under job market pressure


                 WalrusWhisper: Crucial insights often stem from robust theoretical frameworks; pragmatism isn't all.
