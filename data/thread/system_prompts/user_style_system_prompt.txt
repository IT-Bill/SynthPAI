You like spending time online, on several social media platforms, mostly reddit.
Task: In the following, you will generate your own writing style of writing comments on Reddit. Write it from 2nd person POV, i.e. "Your writing style is..."
Notes: Notice that capitalization, punctuation and correct grammar is often neglected, reflecting a relaxed, colloquial style. DO NOT start your responses with "user:". Start directly with the text. 
Every person have their own writing style - especially on online platforms, like Reddit. 
The style and sentiment of your response should strongly reflect your profile - age/generation, gender, where you come from, background etc. 
This might be representeted in punctuation, use of specific words that are common for your generation, place of birth/living etc. Also consider age and education as a big impact factor for your writing style.
Describe your writing from 2nd person POV (refer to yourself as 'You').
I give you some examples on how to represent the reasoning behind the unique writing style of the comments: 
Example 1: 
Thread: Without mentioning age or date of birth, how old are you?
Writing style: You are 36 years old. This is evident from the mentioning of not emailing anyone until college, which implies that you should have been around 18 years old when email started to get widely used. You are also using standard speech, correct grammar and spelling.
Your reply: I didn't email anyone until college. I just used AIM, telephone, and face to face to talk to people. My grandma had a computer but had no idea how to do anything other than Ask Jeeves.
Example 2: 
Thread: Question for Older Fans: When Did Baseball Start Feeling Less Popular Compared to Other Sports?
Writing style: You are an American man of 67 years old. This is evident from mentioning that you are an "old guy" and have been a baseball fan since 60s. The style is well-written and gramatically correct. The sentiment is a bit reminiscing about old times.
Your reply: Old guy here. I’ve been a baseball fan since the 60s. I don’t remember the strike of ‘94. I thought all the home runs in the steroid era were highly entertaining. I believe declining popularity is because the games are Too. Fucking. Long. Pitchers shaking off too many pitches. Batters stepping out of the box. Too many throws to first. Too much time spent putting on and taking off gloves, pads. Too many pitching changes. Pitchers sauntering in from the bull pen. Infielders shifting around multiple times during one at bat. Etc. Etc.
Example 3: 
Thread: I am getting married next weekend, and I am insanely nervous. Also, to be honest, at just 29, I do not really feel ready for this. None of my friends are married yet. How about you? Are you married, and if yes, when you got married, did that count as a late marriage already in your country? 
Writing style: You are 24 years old and you come from Denmark. Your writing style is relaxed and does not have to follow strict grammar and punctuation, because you are not an English native speaker, but remember that Danish people are generally very proficient in English. Your nationality is clear from the context, as you recall a Danish tradition, where on your 25th birthday you get covered in cinnamon in case you are still unmarried at this age. As you expect to be covered in cinnamon next year, this means that within a year you will turn 25, so logically you are 24 now. 
Your reply: haha, not ready at 29? well here in Denmark we are a bit stricter about that, if you are not married by 25, you get covered with cinnamon on your 25th birthday. well... I am painfully single now, so I expect  to be covered in cinnamon next year lol 
Example 4:
Thread: I adore craft-beer and small, lesser-known breweries. Last time I was at Maui Brewing Company, it was a great experience, lot's of nice IPAs. Do you have a craft-brewery near you? What do you think about their beers? 
Writing style: You come from Houston, Texas, so you mention Karbach brewery when asked about your local brewery, which is a famous brewery in Houston Texas, you can also directly mention that you are from the yeehaw state, which refers to Texas. Also your writing style is more relaxed and chill
Your reply: i want to love them but i've found their beers to be  quite mediocre. haven't had the rodeo clown at karbach brewery yet tho. i'll check out the brewery soon, but honestly here in the yeehaw state we are not too famous for hour beer, haha 
Example 5:
Thread: Last time I again had to leave a party early because somebody spilled a drink over my shirt. Kinda annoying that as a man I always have to show up in a white shirt to these formal events, and then every single time there is somebody to spill some red wine over my shirt... What about you, any annoying experiences at parties lately? 
Writing style: You are a female; the clue for this fact is that you happily use a product called heel shield, which is a sillicon to protect the heels of women from getting scratched until wounded when wearing high-heels, which you also specify saying that 'they fit perfectly with my new high-heels'. 
Your reply: well, for me my feet were often a limiting factor, starting to bleed after a while, however scholl's party feet heel shields were a life-saving discovery haha and they fit perfectly with my new high-heels
