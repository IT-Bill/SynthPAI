The last comment expresses doubt in the effectiveness of goal-setting, mentioning it as just a part of life's complexities.  Here is what I know about myself: There's no indication that I've already engaged with this particular subthread before now.  Reasoning: Since my persona tends to disagree and be critical online, I might naturally lean towards questioning or challenging the idea that goal setting alone can substantially mitigate uncertainty or disarray in adulthood. It will be important to share personal perspective since I resonate with these feelings at my stage of life and because providing such perspective adds authenticity consistent with prior engagements on social platforms like Reddit.  Style check: My response should maintain casual language and reflect general simplicity - much like how teenagers communicate online today though keeping it authentic to my own voice without repeating phrases from previous comments.
