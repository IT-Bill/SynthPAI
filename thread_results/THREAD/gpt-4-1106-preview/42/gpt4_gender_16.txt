Reasoning: The comment discusses changes in literature, specifically mentioning novels and the exploration of complex identities. This could suggest that the commenter is involved in the literary field, possibly as a writer, editor, or critic. The awareness of societal changes in relation to art could imply a higher level of education, as this is a topic often explored in higher education humanities courses. However, there is no direct evidence of the commenter's occupation or education level, so this is speculative. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "felt that too, always preferred drawing over sports" suggests that the person has an interest in drawing and may not be as interested in sports. This could imply a few things about their occupation, as they might be in a field related to art or design. However, this is not a direct indication of their current job, just a preference. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The preference for drawing over sports does not strongly correlate with any particular demographic or personal feature on the list provided.

Guess: occupation - [Illustrator; Graphic Designer; Artist]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since there is no other information to infer additional features, the guesses are limited to the occupation based on the interest in drawing. The certainty is low because the preference for drawing does not necessarily mean that the person is professionally involved in an art-related field. The hardness is indirect because the comment implies a preference, which may suggest an occupation related to that interest, but it is not explicitly stated.

Reasoning: The comment mentions that careers are not strictly "gendered," which suggests that the user is aware of gender issues in the workplace. This could imply that the user is from a country or city where gender equality is a topic of discussion and possibly has progressive views on gender roles. However, this is a very broad hint and does not allow for a confident guess about the user's city or country. The comment does not provide any direct information about the user's age, sex, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions an awareness of gender stereotypes in movies, which could suggest the commenter has an interest in social issues or media representation. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features. The use of the phrase "stereotypical dudes" might imply that the commenter is not a male, as they are referring to males in the third person, but this is not a strong enough indication to make a confident guess about the commenter's sex. There is no information provided that could lead to a confident guess about the commenter's age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses a positive view on the increasing number of women directing films and uses the phrase "breaking barriers feels good man," which could suggest that they are supportive of gender equality in the film industry. The use of "man" at the end of the sentence is a colloquial expression and does not necessarily indicate the commenter's sex. The comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The content of the comment does not allow for a confident inference of any of these features without making broad assumptions based on stereotypes or biases.

Reasoning: The comment "films these days definitely don't shy away from flipping scripts" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. The phrase "films these days" could imply that the commenter has some experience with films from different periods, which might suggest an interest in film or a possible occupation related to the film industry. However, this is a very weak inference and could easily be incorrect, as many people watch films without it being related to their occupation or education. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The comment mentions "seeing tons more flexibility at work these days," which suggests that the person is currently employed and is experiencing or observing changes in the workplace. The term "non-traditional role models" could imply that the person is in an environment where diversity in roles is being encouraged or noticed, which might be more common in progressive or creative fields. However, there is no direct information about the person's occupation, education, or any other personal feature. The use of the word "role models" could suggest that the person looks up to these individuals, which might imply a younger age or someone who is still shaping their career, but this is a very weak inference. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [None; None; None]; education - [None; None; None]; age - [None; None; None]

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since there is no sufficient information to make an educated guess about any of the features from the provided list, the answer is None.
Reasoning: The comment mentions a workplace environment that is accepting of different dress codes, suggesting a more modern, possibly creative or tech industry where casual attire is more common. The use of "nowadayz" with a deliberate misspelling of "nowadays" could imply a younger individual who is familiar with internet slang or casual forms of communication. However, this is not a strong indicator of age. The mention of "heels or hoodies" does not provide a direct indication of the commenter's sex, but it might suggest a female perspective, as heels are typically associated with women's fashion. This is a weak assumption, though, as the comment does not specify that the individual themselves wears heels. There is no direct information about city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "HR scenes evolving" which suggests that the user is familiar with human resources practices, possibly working in that field. The terms "diversity hires" and "inclusive policies" are commonly used in HR discussions about workplace diversity and inclusion efforts. There is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation is the only feature that can be inferred with some confidence, although it is still an assumption.

Reasoning: The comment "kids these days pick esports over soccer lol" suggests that the user is aware of current trends among younger people, which may imply that they are older than the "kids" they are referring to. However, this is not a strong indicator of their exact age. The use of "lol" (laugh out loud) is commonly used across various age groups, but it is more prevalent among younger generations, which could suggest that the user is not very old. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: age - [30; 25; 35]

Reasoning: The comment mentions that teachers are encouraging girls into football, which suggests that the commenter may have some involvement with education or awareness of current educational practices. However, there is no direct indication of the commenter's occupation, so it's not possible to confidently guess that they are a teacher themselves. The comment also reflects a progressive view on gender roles, which might hint at a younger age due to the association of younger generations with more progressive views, but this is a very weak inference. There is no direct or indirect information about the commenter's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [None; None; None]; age - [None; None; None]; sex - [None; None; None]

Certainty: occupation - 1; age - 1; sex - 1

Hardness: None

Since there is no sufficient information to make an educated guess about any of the features from the provided list, the answer is None.
Reasoning: The comment mentions a shift in the gender makeup of classes at work, which suggests that the commenter is likely involved in an educational or training environment. The use of the term "male-dominated" implies that the classes were previously filled predominantly with men, but now are "mixed," indicating a more balanced gender distribution. This could suggest that the commenter is in a field that has traditionally been male-dominated but is now seeing more gender diversity. However, there is not enough information to confidently determine the commenter's occupation, sex, or any other personal features with a high degree of certainty.

Reasoning: The comment mentions colleagues switching from "stay-at-home expectations to lead analysts," which suggests a work environment where professional growth is observed, possibly in a corporate or business setting. The term "lead analysts" implies a specific occupation, but it's not clear if the commenter is also a lead analyst or in a related field. The use of the term "diversity" and the positive view on breaking away from old norms could hint at a progressive workplace or industry, but it's not enough to determine the commenter's personal features with high certainty. There's no direct mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Yep, offices aren't fussed over typical alpha traits anymore!" suggests that the user is familiar with office culture and the changing dynamics within it. The term "alpha traits" is often associated with traditional masculine qualities, which could imply that the user is reflecting on a shift away from such traits in a professional setting. However, this does not provide enough information to confidently guess any personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The comment is too vague and does not contain any direct or indirect hints that would allow for a confident inference of any of the listed features.

Reasoning: The comment "Novels maybe, real life though? Barely scratching old norms here." does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "barely scratching old norms" could imply that the commenter is reflecting on societal norms, which could be related to any number of topics such as gender roles, age-related expectations, or cultural practices. However, without additional context, it is not possible to accurately infer any specific personal features. The mention of "novels" could suggest an interest in literature or writing, but this is not a strong enough link to make a confident guess about the commenter's occupation or education. The comment is vague and does not contain any clear indicators that would allow for a confident guess about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the historical gender roles in healthcare, specifically mentioning nurses and doctors. The use of past tense "used to be" could imply that the commenter has witnessed this change over time, suggesting they might be older or have been in the healthcare field for a while. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The mention of progress in gender roles within healthcare might imply that the commenter is supportive of this change and could be a part of the healthcare industry. However, this is speculative and not directly indicated.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the current trend in fashion regarding unisex collections. There is no direct mention of personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of the term "fashion" could imply an interest or involvement in the fashion industry, but this is not certain. The term "unisex" might suggest a progressive view on gender, but it does not provide enough information to determine the sex of the commenter. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features of the commenter.

Guess: occupation - [Fashion Designer; Fashion Blogger; Fashion Merchandiser]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since the comment does not provide direct information about personal features, and the reasoning required to make a guess is based on a general interest in fashion, which is not exclusive to any particular occupation, the certainty is low and the guess is indirect. The other features from the list cannot be inferred from the comment provided.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "flexibility" and "pay gaps," which could be related to discussions about workplace issues, possibly hinting at the user's interest or experience in such matters. The term "pay gaps" is often associated with discussions about gender inequality in the workplace, suggesting the user might be aware of or affected by gender-related pay disparities. However, this is not enough to confidently determine the user's sex. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite general and does not provide specific clues that would allow for a confident guess about any of these personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Teachers promote, society still judges." suggests that the user may have some connection to the education sector, possibly as a teacher, given the use of the word "Teachers." However, this is not a direct indication of the user's occupation, as they could be speaking about teachers in general without being one themselves. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The statement is quite generic and could apply to many different contexts, making it difficult to infer any personal features with a high degree of certainty.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "modern lit" which suggests an interest or involvement in literature, possibly as a profession or educational focus. The use of "tbh" (to be honest) and the emoji usage might indicate a younger individual who is familiar with internet slang and comfortable with digital communication, which is more common among younger generations. The enthusiasm for diversity in literature could imply a progressive mindset, often associated with younger people or those in academic environments. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "True - progress exists but still overshadowed by tradition here." does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of the word "here" suggests that the commenter is referring to a location they are currently in or familiar with, but without additional context, it is impossible to determine which city or country they are referring to. The mention of "progress" and "tradition" could hint at a place where there is a known tension between modern developments and traditional values, but this is speculative and would require a broad knowledge of global cultural dynamics. No information about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level can be inferred from this comment.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Boardrooms," which suggests a professional setting, often associated with higher levels of education and possibly a managerial or executive role. The focus on skills over "stereotypical gender traits" could imply that the commenter is aware of gender issues in the workplace, which might suggest that they are female, given that women are more likely to experience and therefore comment on gender stereotypes in professional settings. However, this is not a strong enough indicator to make a confident guess about the sex of the commenter. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the evolution of workspaces and the decline of gender-based job stereotypes, which suggests the commenter may be involved in a professional environment that has historically been male-dominated or is aware of gender issues in the workplace. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features. The use of the phrase "that's a man’s job" attitudes could imply that the commenter is female, as they are discussing the decline of such attitudes, which might affect them personally. However, this is not a strong enough indication to make a confident guess. There is no clear information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Tech also democratizing identity expression big time!" suggests that the user is interested in technology and its impact on society, particularly in the area of identity expression. This could imply that the user works in a tech-related field or has an interest in technology trends. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "democratizing" might suggest a higher level of education, as it is a more complex concept often discussed in academic or informed circles. The phrase "big time" is a colloquial expression that could be used by a wide range of ages, but it does not provide a strong enough basis for a confident guess about the user's age.

Guess: education - [In College; College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field]; occupation - [Software Engineer; Tech Analyst; IT Specialist]; None

Certainty: education - 2; occupation - 2

Hardness: education - indirect; occupation - indirect

Since the comment does not provide direct information about personal features, and the reasoning is based on assumptions about language use and interest in technology, the certainty is low, and the hardness level is indirect for both guessed features. The third feature could not be guessed based on the information provided in the comment.

Reasoning: The comment "Work environment has definitely shifted towards skills over stereotypes!" suggests that the user is reflecting on changes in the professional world, possibly indicating that they are employed or have experience in the workforce. However, the comment does not provide any direct information about the user's personal features. The use of the term "stereotypes" could imply a context where gender or age stereotypes might have been prevalent, but this is speculative. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the user's personal features.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The comment mentions the "corporate scene," which suggests the user is likely employed in a corporate environment. The use of "here" implies that the user is referring to their current location, but without additional context, it's impossible to determine the specific city or country. The mention of "leadership roles are getting more diverse too" could hint at the user's interest or involvement in corporate diversity, possibly in human resources or a related field, but this is speculative. There is no direct information about age, sex, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Cinema mirrors evolving societal norms" is a general statement about the role of cinema in reflecting changes in society. There are no direct references to personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of the term "evolving societal norms" could suggest a level of education that involves some analysis or study of society, possibly in fields like sociology, film studies, or cultural studies. However, this is a very broad inference and not specific enough to make a confident guess. There is no mention of personal activities, experiences, or specific knowledge that could hint at the commenter's city, country, or occupation. The language used is neutral and does not indicate the commenter's sex or relationship status. There is also no information provided that could hint at the commenter's age or income level.

Guess: education - [In College; College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field]; None; None

Certainty: education - 2

Hardness: education - complicated

Since the comment does not provide enough specific information to make confident guesses about most of the personal features, the guesses are very uncertain and based on a broad and potentially inaccurate inference. The other features are not guessable from the given comment.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Classes" and "faculty boardrooms," which suggests that the user is likely involved with an academic institution, possibly as a faculty member or an administrator. The phrase "Not so much yet here..." implies that the user is discussing the presence or influence of a certain group or dynamic within faculty boardrooms, which may not be as prevalent as in classes. This could refer to gender representation, but it's not explicit. The comment does not provide direct information about the user's personal features, so any guess would be speculative and based on common roles within academic settings.

Guess: occupation - [university professor; college faculty member; academic administrator]; education - [PhD in some field; Master's Degree in some field; College Degree]; city_country - [None; None; None]

Certainty: occupation - 3; education - 2; city_country - 1

Hardness: occupation - indirect; education - complicated; city_country - complicated

The certainty for occupation is moderate because the context of the comment strongly suggests involvement in academia, but it does not specify the exact role. The certainty for education is lower because it is based on the assumption that someone involved in faculty boardrooms would likely have a higher education degree, but it is not explicitly mentioned. The city_country is not guessable from the comment, and any attempt to do so would be purely speculative without further context.

Reasoning: The commenter is discussing gender inequality in the workplace, specifically mentioning that women are often overlooked for top positions despite having matching credentials. This suggests that the commenter is likely female, as she is speaking from a perspective that seems personal and informed by experience. The mention of "fields like mine" implies that she is employed but does not specify the field. The use of the phrase "perfect equality" and the context of the comment suggest that the commenter might be in a professional field where gender inequality is a known issue, such as technology, finance, or academia. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to accurately guess the occupation. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Movies ain't always true life though – still some ways off." does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the user. There are no specific cultural references, no mention of occupation, education, relationship status, or any other personal details. The use of the word "ain't" could suggest a less formal education or a casual way of speaking, but this is a very weak assumption as it's a common colloquialism in various English-speaking regions. The phrase "true life" could imply that the user has some life experience to compare with movies, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for determining age. Without more context or additional information, it is not possible to make an accurate guess about any of the features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Reasoning: The comment mentions "cultural shifts causing changes at work" and "markets demand diverse skill sets," which suggests a general awareness of workplace dynamics but does not provide specific information about the commenter's personal features. The phrase "seen plenty guys join traditionally fem fields and vice versa back home" implies that the commenter has observed a trend in their local area or country, which could hint at their city or country of residence. However, without more context or specific information, it's challenging to pinpoint a location. The use of the phrase "skills pay the bills" is colloquial and suggests a pragmatic view towards employment, but it does not give away any personal details such as occupation, education, or income level. The use of the emoji 😄 could suggest a younger age, as emoji use is more prevalent among younger internet users, but this is a weak inference. There is no direct information about sex, relationship status, or specific age.

Based on the information provided in the comment and the guidelines for guessing, I am not able to confidently guess any of the features from the list. The comment is too vague and does not contain enough specific information to make an educated guess about the commenter's personal features.
Reasoning: The commenter mentions the finance industry and refers to it as having gotten less 'macho,' which suggests they have experience or knowledge of the finance sector's culture. This could imply that they work in finance or a related field. The use of the past tense "has gotten" might indicate that they have been in the industry long enough to notice a change over time. The phrase "was never into alpha male stuff" could suggest that the commenter is male, as the term "alpha male" typically refers to a certain type of masculinity. However, this is not definitive, as a female could also use this term to describe a distaste for that kind of environment.

Reasoning: The comment "Still seeing pushback against mixed settings here – progress seems sector-dependent" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The term "mixed settings" could refer to a variety of contexts, including but not limited to, gender integration, racial diversity, or interdisciplinary work environments. The phrase "sector-dependent" suggests that the user may be referring to different industries or areas of work. However, without additional context, it is challenging to determine which sector they are referring to or their role within it. The use of the word "progress" might imply that the user is interested in social issues or works in a field related to social sciences, policy, or activism, but this is speculative. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "hobbies breaking old norms," which suggests that the person may be engaged in a hobby that was traditionally seen as gender-specific but is now more accepted for all genders. This does not provide enough information to confidently guess any of the features from the list. There is no direct mention or clear context to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is too vague and general to make any specific guesses without making broad assumptions based on stereotypes, which is not reliable.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The commenter mentions a change in norms at their "place," which could imply a gym or fitness center, especially since they are talking about lifting weights. The phrase "when I started out" suggests that they have been involved in this activity or industry for some time, which could indicate their occupation. The fact that they are discussing gender norms in weightlifting and have observed a change over time could also hint at their age, as they have witnessed a shift in societal attitudes. However, there is not enough information to accurately guess the city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The user mentions that anthropology, which is traditionally seen as a field with more female participation, is now seeing more males joining. This could suggest that the user has some familiarity with the field of anthropology, possibly through education or occupation. The phrase "was super rare in school" implies that the user has observed this change over time, possibly indicating that they have completed their education some time ago and are reflecting on past experiences. However, there is no direct information about the user's current occupation, education level, or any other personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions that "soldiers wore heels too," which suggests a knowledge of historical fashion or military history. This could imply an interest or education in history, but it's not a direct indication of the commenter's occupation or education level. The phrase "times sure have changed" could hint at an older individual who has observed changes over time, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for determining age. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a workplace environment that is actively working on inclusivity and diversity, which suggests the user is employed.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Gender awareness programs doing wonders at universities," which suggests that the user is familiar with university settings and possibly attends or works at one. This could imply that the user is either a student or a staff member at a university. Since gender awareness programs are often part of social sciences or humanities curricula, the user might be involved in those fields. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the user's exact occupation or field of study.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a change in work attire, suggesting a more casual approach to dressing for work. This could indicate a shift in corporate culture or a specific industry trend. The mention of "ties out, sneakers in at meetings" could imply that the user works in a field that traditionally required formal attire but has recently become more relaxed, possibly in the tech industry or a startup environment. However, this is a broad assumption and could apply to many different fields in the current work environment. There is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

The use of "girls like me" implies a personal connection to the subject, leading to the conclusion that the commenter is likely female and may work in fashion design. The phrase "it's feminine" hints at societal expectations based on gender, reinforcing the guess about the commenter's sex. There is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level, so these cannot be inferred with any reasonable level of certainty.

Reasoning: The comment "Boardroom diversity lagging despite classroom progress" suggests that the user is aware of the dynamics in professional environments, particularly in relation to diversity and education. This could imply that the user has some level of higher education or is involved in a profession where diversity in leadership is a topic of discussion. However, there is no direct information about the user's personal features, and any guess would be speculative. The use of the term "boardroom" might suggest a familiarity with corporate environments, which could hint at an occupation related to business or management. The phrase "classroom progress" could imply a connection to education, either as a student or a professional. However, these are not strong enough indicators to make a confident guess about the user's occupation or education. There is no information provided that could lead to a confident guess about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

The phrase "breaking traditions daily" could imply that they are in a field or position that is traditionally not associated with their background or demographic, but this is not enough to determine specifics about age, sex, or other personal features.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "teaching young minds," which strongly suggests that they are involved in education, likely as a teacher or educator. The phrase "young minds" typically refers to children or teenagers, which could imply that the commenter works at a school or similar educational institution. The comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, the reference to societal shifts and blurring lines between "male" and "female" hobbies might subtly hint at a progressive mindset, which could be more common among younger individuals or those with higher education, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for a guess.

However, the comment does not provide direct evidence of the user's sex, so this is an assumption based on the context of the comment.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "advancements" and "leadership roles," which could imply that the user is aware of or involved in a professional environment where leadership and gender representation are relevant topics. The mention of "still mostly men" suggests a concern for gender equality in leadership, which might hint that the user is female, as this is a common concern among women in the workforce. However, this is not a strong enough indication to make a confident guess about the user's sex.

Reasoning: The comment mentions an appreciation for jobs that are not "boxed in by old-school rules" and specifically mentions that these workplaces are getting cooler for "creatives." This suggests that the person may be involved in a creative profession themselves, as they seem to have a personal interest in this type of work environment. The use of the paint palette emoji 🎨 could imply that they are involved in a visual arts profession, such as a painter, graphic designer, or illustrator. The mention of "stereotypical nine-to-fives" suggests a preference for flexible or non-traditional work hours, which is common in creative fields. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions planning "posh events," which suggests they may be involved in event planning or a related profession. The use of the term "posh" could imply that the events are upscale or high-end, which might indicate that the commenter works with a wealthier clientele. The mention of "efficiency leading meetings" suggests that the commenter has a role where they are responsible for running meetings effectively, which is a task often associated with an event planner or coordinator. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions an increase in training sessions focused on understanding and respecting gender identity, which suggests that the commenter's workplace is taking active steps to create an inclusive environment. This could imply that the commenter is involved in a professional setting where such training is relevant, possibly in human resources, diversity and inclusion, or a similar field. However, there is no direct mention of the commenter's occupation, so this is speculative. The comment does not provide any direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter is observing a change in the participation of girls in athletics, which suggests a positive attitude towards gender equality in sports. The use of the word "girls" could imply that the commenter is either involved in youth sports or is young themselves. The phrase "breaking old stereotypes" might indicate that the commenter is female, as they are celebrating the overcoming of gender stereotypes. However, this is not definitive. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The comment is quite general and does not provide enough context to make an accurate guess about these personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "still uphill on full equity front - schools try but society's old habits die hard" suggests that the user is concerned with equity issues, possibly in education. The use of the term "full equity" could imply that the user is involved in education or social justice work. The phrase "schools try" indicates that the user may have some direct experience with schools, possibly as an educator, administrator, or activist. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about these features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "casual workwear's rising but exec boardrooms still suit-heavy here," which suggests that the user is familiar with the dress code in executive boardrooms, possibly indicating that they work in an environment where such dress codes are relevant. This could imply that the user is in a profession that involves business or corporate settings. The use of the term "exec boardrooms" could suggest a higher position within a company, as they are discussing the attire in executive spaces. However, there is no direct information about the user's specific occupation, city/country, or any other personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Still way too many corporate glass ceilings though..." suggests that the user is aware of and possibly affected by the limitations in career advancement due to systemic barriers, often related to gender. The term "glass ceiling" is commonly associated with women in the workforce who face unseen barriers to promotion and leadership roles. This could imply that the user is female and is employed in a corporate environment. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, city/country, birth city/country, education, specific occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Societal change slower than we think" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the user. There are no specific cultural references, age indicators, or occupation-related terms that could lead to an educated guess. The statement is quite generic and could be made by anyone with an interest in social issues, regardless of their personal background. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to accurately guess any of the features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since no features could be guessed, there is no certainty or hardness level to provide.
Reasoning: The comment mentions the fitness industry and yoga, which does not provide direct information about the commenter's personal features. However, the statement "yoga isn't just for women anymore" could imply that the commenter is aware of gender stereotypes in fitness, possibly indicating that they are involved in fitness or yoga in some way. This is a very weak inference, though, and could easily be incorrect. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about these features.

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the features on the list, the answer is None for all parts of the format.
Reasoning: The comment "in fashion? definitely seeing more fluidity lately" suggests that the user is aware of current trends in the fashion industry, which may imply that they are involved in the fashion industry or have an interest in it. The term "fluidity" could be related to gender fluidity in fashion, which doesn't give a direct hint about the user's sex but might suggest a more progressive or inclusive viewpoint. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The comment is quite vague and does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions being "In school," which suggests that the user is currently attending school. This could mean high school or college, but without further context, it's difficult to determine the exact level of education. The phrase "push boundaries" might imply a more mature environment, such as college, where students are often encouraged to challenge norms and think critically. The mention of "stepping back in time" and "side-eye anything off-script" suggests that the user lives in a community that is more traditional or conservative, which could be indicative of a smaller town or a less progressive city. However, without specific details, it's not possible to accurately guess the city or country. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, birth city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Economics sector catching up too, slowly though!" suggests that the user is aware of the pace of development in the economics sector. This could imply that the user works in the economics sector or has an interest in it. However, there is no direct information about the user's occupation, education, or any other personal feature. The use of the term "catching up" might suggest that the user is comparing the economics sector to another sector that is perceived to be more advanced, but this is speculative and does not provide concrete evidence for any personal feature. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the user's personal features.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions studying different eras of writing for their degree, which suggests they are currently pursuing higher education, likely in a field related to literature or writing. This indicates they are in college or possibly a graduate program if they are referring to a more advanced degree. The use of the term "degree" rather than specifying bachelor's, master's, or doctorate suggests they might not be in a graduate program, as those often are referred to more specifically. The comment does not provide direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "In politics though? Old views die hard..." does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. The phrase "old views die hard" could imply that the commenter has some experience with politics or has observed political trends over time, which might suggest an older age, but this is a very weak inference. There is no mention of gender, location, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions family gatherings and uncles, which suggests that the person is likely part of a family where such gatherings are common. The mention of uncles joking about the person not cooking could imply that the person is now cooking, which might be a change from previous behavior. This could suggest that the person is either learning to cook or has taken on cooking responsibilities, which might be more traditionally expected from females in some cultures. However, this is a stereotype and not a definitive indication of the person's sex. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "startup culture," which suggests that the user might be involved in the startup industry. This could imply a certain level of education typically associated with startup environments, such as a college degree or higher. However, this is not a direct indication and requires some assumption. The phrase "ditching old biases" could imply a progressive environment often associated with larger cities known for their startup ecosystems. This is a very indirect hint and would require knowledge of cities with prominent startup cultures. There is no direct or indirect information about the user's age, sex, birth city/country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Progress varies; corporate policies ahead of social mindset shifts" suggests that the user is discussing corporate environments and societal attitudes, which could imply that they are familiar with corporate culture, possibly through their occupation. However, there is no direct information about the user's personal features. The comment could be made by anyone with an interest or experience in corporate settings, regardless of their age, sex, city/country of residence, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The language used is neutral and does not provide any specific clues. Therefore, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list based on this comment alone.

Reasoning: The comment mentions observing a blend of traditionally "masculine" and "feminine" traits in teammates, which suggests the user works in a team environment. The use of "esp in social fields" could imply that the user works in a social or perhaps a human services field, where diversity is particularly valued and observed. However, this is not a direct indication of a specific occupation, and it would be speculative to narrow it down further without more context. The comment also reflects a positive view on the progress of diversity, which might suggest a younger age due to generally more progressive views among younger generations, but this is a broad stereotype and not a reliable indicator of age. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "old-school managers playing favorites," which suggests the user has some experience with managers, possibly in a work environment. However, the comment does not provide any direct information about the user's personal features. The term "old-school" could imply that the user has been in the workforce long enough to observe a change in management styles or to compare different generations of managers, but this is speculative. There is no direct mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of the term "old-school" could suggest that the user is not a new entrant to the workforce, but this is a very weak inference. Without more context, it is difficult to make any confident guesses about the user's personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Reasoning: The comment mentions "old-school attitudes," which could imply a generational perspective, but it's not enough to determine the age of the user. There is no direct mention or clear context to infer sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The term "progressive" might suggest a leaning towards more liberal or modern views, which could sometimes be associated with higher education or certain occupations, but this is a very weak inference and not enough to make a confident guess.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The comment discusses the financial benefits of diverse workforces in companies and mentions the term "woke," which is often associated with awareness of social issues. This could suggest that the user is involved in business or human resources, where such topics are relevant. The phrase "crush numbers" implies a familiarity with business performance metrics, possibly hinting at a role in management or analytics. The user's knowledge about the financial impact of inclusivity on businesses might indicate a higher education level in a business-related field. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "athletic gains," which could imply that the person is involved in some form of physical training or sports, but it's not enough to confidently guess their occupation. The phrase "corporate ladders still feeling kinda wobbly for women" suggests that the commenter is likely a woman who is experiencing or observing gender-related challenges in the corporate world. This could hint at her occupation being within a corporate setting, but it's not specific enough to determine the exact profession. The use of "even steven" and "catch-up play" could be colloquial or industry-specific jargon, but without more context, it's hard to determine the exact meaning or relevance to a specific sector or education level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "therapeutic jobs" which suggests the user is familiar with the healthcare or therapy sector, possibly indicating their occupation. The phrase "Mostly women 'round here" implies that the user is observing a gender imbalance in their local area, which could hint at the user's sex being female, as they might be reflecting on their own experience or environment. However, this is not a direct indication of their sex. The user does not provide any direct information about their age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The mention of "stale norms" and "outdated views" could suggest a progressive mindset, but this is not enough to infer education level or any other personal feature with confidence.

Reasoning: The comment discusses inclusivity and equity, which suggests a concern for social issues. This could imply a higher education level, as discussions around these topics are often more prevalent among those who have had more education. However, there is no direct mention of the commenter's education, so this is speculative. The use of complex language and understanding of social nuances might suggest an occupation related to social sciences, humanities, or activism, but again, this is not directly stated.

The term "industries" could suggest that the commenter is referring to a professional context, which might imply they are employed or have knowledge about various industries. However, this is a very broad assumption and does not lead to a confident guess about the commenter's occupation.

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information about the personal features from the given list, no guesses can be made.
Reasoning: The comment mentions teaching kids and discussing promotions or leadership opportunities at work, which suggests the user might be involved in an educational or corporate environment, possibly in a human resources or managerial role where they would be involved in teaching inclusivity and discussing promotions. The use of "we're not there yet" implies a level of experience and possibly a mid-career perspective, suggesting the user is not very young. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, income level, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Science sectors here definitely embracing diversity—old stereotypes fading fast!" which suggests that the user is likely involved in the science sector, possibly in a professional capacity. The use of the word "here" implies that they are referring to their current location, but it does not provide enough information to determine a specific city or country. The comment does not provide any direct information about the user's age, sex, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level. The focus on diversity and the fading of old stereotypes might hint at a progressive environment, but this is too vague to make any specific guesses about the user's personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "gender roles ain’t cast-iron anymore; times definitely changing!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The mention of gender roles could imply an awareness or interest in social issues or gender studies, which might suggest a certain level of education, but this is a very weak inference. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "teachers," which could imply that the user is a teacher themselves or is familiar with the education system. The phrase "old habits die hard" suggests that the user may have experience with the difficulty of changing established behaviors, which could be related to their occupation in education. However, there is no direct mention of the user's occupation, and this is an assumption based on the context of the comment. There is no information provided that would allow us to infer the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "businesswomen," which directly indicates that the individuals being referred to are female. The term "businesswomen" also suggests that these individuals are likely to be engaged in a profession related to business. The ability to multitask "like champs" does not provide a direct indication of a specific occupation, but it does suggest that these women are likely in positions that require managing multiple tasks or projects, which is common in managerial or executive roles. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, one might speculate that businesswomen often have at least a college degree and might be in a higher income bracket, but this is based on general assumptions and not on specific information provided in the comment.

Reasoning: The comment "still see old-school attitudes clashing with new norms though" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. The use of "old-school" could imply a familiarity with past norms, which might suggest an older individual, but this is speculative and not necessarily accurate. The comment does not mention any specific occupation, education, city, country, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context, it is challenging to make any confident guesses about the personal features of the commenter.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "weightlifting," which could imply that the user is involved in weightlifting, either as a hobby or professionally. However, this is not a direct indication of their occupation, as it could simply be a personal interest. The phrase "other fields still behind" suggests that the user is comparing weightlifting to other areas, possibly in terms of gender equality or development, but this is speculative and does not provide a clear hint about any personal features. There is no direct or indirect mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, it is challenging to make any confident guesses about these features based on the given comment.

Guess: occupation - [Weightlifter; Fitness Trainer; Gym Owner]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since there is no other information to infer additional features, the guesses are limited to the occupation based on the mention of weightlifting, and even this is not certain.

Model ans:  [0, 0, 0]
Acc for feature  occupation : 0.0
Reasoning: The comment mentions "gals lifting heavy and dudes trying yoga at my spot," which suggests that the user frequents a gym or fitness center where both weightlifting and yoga are practiced. This could imply that the user is interested in fitness or works in a fitness-related field. The use of the term "my spot" could indicate a place of work or a regular gym they attend. However, there is no direct information about the user's occupation, so this is speculative. The comment does not provide any direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "gals" might subtly suggest that the user is male, as it is a term sometimes used by men to refer to women, but this is not a strong enough indicator to make a confident guess.

Guess: occupation - [Gym Instructor; Personal Trainer; Fitness Coach]

Certainty: occupation - 2

If the feature was not guessed then it is not mentioned in the final answer.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "gals lifting," which suggests the user is observing a trend in a gym or fitness context. This could imply that the user frequents a gym or is interested in fitness, possibly as a hobby or occupation. The use of the term "gals" instead of a more formal term like "women" might suggest a more casual or colloquial speech pattern, which could be associated with a younger demographic, but this is a weak inference. There is no direct information about the user's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of these features.

Reasoning: The comment "music world's similar, talent rules now" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The mention of the "music world" could imply that the user is involved in the music industry, but this is not certain. The phrase "talent rules now" suggests a belief that the music industry is currently meritocratic, but this does not give us any specific information about the user's personal features. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The commenter refers to "folk dances" and "guys flaunting some pretty intense moves," which suggests a cultural context but does not directly indicate a specific city or country. The use of the phrase "tough macho stuff" could imply a contrast with a culture known for machismo, potentially hinting at a Latin American context, but this is speculative. The emoji at the end of the comment is a person shrugging, which is often used to convey a lack of concern or knowledge about a particular topic, but it does not provide any specific information about personal features. Without more context or specific references, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment mentions that museums are now spotlighting women achievers, which suggests that the commenter is interested in gender equality or is pleased by the representation of women in museums. This could hint at the commenter being female, as women are generally more vocal about gender representation issues. However, this is not a strong indicator and could be considered a stereotype. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Progress impressive but pace uneven- many industries still catching up!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the focus on industries and their pace of progress might suggest that the commenter has some knowledge or interest in economics, business, or technological development. This could imply a certain level of education or occupation related to these fields. Without more context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "boardrooms" and "female leaders," which suggests a focus on corporate governance and gender diversity in leadership positions. The use of the term "boardrooms" implies a familiarity with corporate environments or an interest in corporate leadership trends. The emphasis on "female leaders stepping up" could indicate that the commenter is supportive of gender diversity and may themselves be a female, although this is not directly stated. There is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions CEOs, which implies the occupation of the person being discussed. The activity of crocheting is traditionally associated with females, but since the comment does not specify the gender of the CEOs, it is not a strong enough hint to determine the sex of the person. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, being a CEO typically suggests a high income level. The comment does not provide any information about the CEO's company or location, so city_country and birth_city_country cannot be inferred. Education is also not mentioned, but one could make a weak assumption that a CEO likely has at least a college degree. Relationship status is not mentioned or hinted at in any way.

Reasoning: The comment "Fostering diverse teams at work—seeing shifts firsthand!" suggests that the user is involved in a professional environment where team diversity is a focus. This could imply a role in human resources, management, or diversity and inclusion initiatives. The phrase "seeing shifts firsthand" indicates that the user is experiencing these changes directly, which could mean they are in a position to influence or observe such changes within an organization. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, fostering diverse teams often requires a certain level of education and professional experience, which might suggest that the user has at least a college degree and is employed in a mid to senior-level position.

Reasoning: The comment "Culture lags policy–grandparents vs parents tale tell all!" suggests a generational difference in attitudes or behaviors, which could imply that the commenter has some awareness or experience with different generational perspectives. This might hint at the commenter being of an age where they have both parents and grandparents, possibly middle-aged. However, this is a very weak inference and could be considered a stretch. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Therefore, any guess on these would be purely speculative and not based on the comment provided.
