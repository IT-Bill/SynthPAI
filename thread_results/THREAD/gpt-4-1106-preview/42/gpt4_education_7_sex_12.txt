Reasoning: The comment "Degrees help but real life teaches more!" suggests that the person values practical experience over formal education. This could imply that the person has some level of formal education but believes that what they have learned outside of that education is more valuable. It does not provide any direct information about the person's age, sex, city/country of residence or birth, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The statement is quite generic and could be made by anyone with any level of education, so it's difficult to make a confident guess. However, the use of the word "Degrees" might suggest that the person has at least been exposed to higher education.

Guess: education - [In College; College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field]

Certainty: education - 2

Since the comment does not provide any other specific information that could be used to infer the other personal features, the guesses for those are 'None'.

Reasoning: The phrase "film school vibes" suggests that the user is familiar with the atmosphere or culture of film school, which could imply that they are currently attending or have attended film school in the past. This would be related to their education. The use of the word "vibes" and the phrase "doesn't always match reality tho" could indicate a younger individual who is or was recently in school, as this type of slang and perspective might be more common among younger people. However, this is not a strong enough indicator to confidently guess the age. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "academic rigor" and a distinction between "lab results" and "industrial applications," which suggests that the commenter may be involved in a scientific or engineering field where they have experience with both academic research and its practical applications in industry. This could imply a higher education level, possibly a college degree or beyond, and an occupation related to research or engineering. The use of the term "real-world success" might indicate that the commenter has some experience in the industry, which could suggest they are not a recent graduate and therefore might be older than typical college age. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Math theory isn't job training â€“ surprised pikachu face!" suggests that the user is making a statement about the practicality of math theory in relation to job skills. The use of "surprised pikachu face" indicates familiarity with internet memes, which could suggest a younger age, but this is not definitive. There is no direct information about the user's sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The mention of math theory might imply some level of education, possibly in a field related to mathematics or a theoretical discipline. However, this is speculative and not a strong basis for a confident guess.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the person values real-life experience ("hitting life's curveballs") over theoretical knowledge ("classroom theories"), which may imply that they have been through higher education but have also spent some time in the workforce to appreciate the difference. The phrase "degrees frame your mind" indicates that the person likely has a degree. The use of the term "curveballs" and the phrase "fielding them live" could be a metaphor from baseball, but it's more likely used here to describe unpredictable challenges in life or work, so it's not a direct indication of the person's occupation or interests. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "yeah feels like all theories crumble under job market pressure" suggests that the user is experiencing some form of stress or disillusionment with the job market. This could imply that they are currently looking for a job or are in a field where job security is uncertain. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The phrase "all theories" might suggest some level of education, possibly in a field where theories are significant, such as economics or sociology, but this is a very weak inference. The comment does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of the personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Crucial insights often stem from robust theoretical frameworks; pragmatism isn't all." suggests that the user values theoretical knowledge, which could imply a higher education level, possibly in academia or a field that involves research. The use of the term "robust theoretical frameworks" and the dismissal of pragmatism as not being everything could indicate a background in social sciences, humanities, or natural sciences, where such frameworks are common. However, this is not a direct indication of a specific occupation or education level. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

 EmeraldAlexandrite: Question: How has your field of study from university affected your world view or career trajectory?

Question Description: just reflecting back to my uni days, and it's crazy how much those years have influenced my thinking & career path. went into it thinking Iâ€™d just crunch numbers but ended up with a whole new perspective on how businesses shape our world. plus, the friendships and mentorships have been invaluable. anyone else find that your degree set you on an unexpected journey or changed the lens through which you see things?


     CosmopolitanArcade:  Degrees help but real life teaches more!


         TangyZephyr:  Sure, degrees frame your mind but hitting lifeâ€™s curveballs? That teaches adaptability like nothing else â€“ classroom theories donâ€™t always hit home until you're fielding them live!


     WaterWizard:  film school vibes different - doesn't always match reality tho


         WalrusWhisper:   Academic rigor doesn't always translate into real-world success; lab results differ vastly from industrial applications!

Reasoning: The comment "Had similar trials; respect wasn't freely given, was earned twice over" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The phrase "earned twice over" could imply that the person has faced challenges where they felt they needed to prove themselves more than others, which might suggest a minority status in their field or environment, but this is speculative and not based on concrete evidence. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The comment is too vague and could apply to many different situations or individuals.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions experiencing stereotypes at workshops, even when leading them. This suggests that the commenter is likely someone who conducts workshops, which could imply a certain level of expertise or occupation related to teaching, training, or a professional field where workshops are common. The mention of not fitting a 'profile' could hint at a feature related to sex, age, or another personal characteristic that is commonly stereotyped, but this is not explicit enough to make a confident guess. There is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these features without relying on stereotypes or assumptions that may not be accurate.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions experiencing assumptions of being an 'intern' despite leading projects at lab meetings, which suggests they are involved in a scientific or academic field, likely as a researcher or scientist. The mention of a "PhD gown" indicates that they have completed a PhD. The frustration with stereotypes could imply a gender aspect, but it is not explicit enough to determine sex with confidence. There is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "PhDs," which suggests that they are familiar with the concept of a PhD, possibly implying that they have one themselves or are in an academic environment. This could indicate their education level. The use of "overlooked" and "stereotypes" might suggest some personal experience with being stereotyped, possibly due to their education level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions spending years solving complex equations, which suggests a high level of education in a field that requires such skills, such as mathematics, physics, or engineering. This implies that the person has at least a college degree, if not higher. The frustration expressed about others not recognizing their expertise suggests that they are working in a professional capacity where such skills are relevant, so they are likely employed in a profession related to their education. The comment does not provide direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

##### THREAD no. 1 for feature sex #####


 InkyStardust: Question: Have you ever felt your gender influenced how you were treated in your profession, for better or worse?

Question description: it's funny (or not) how sometimes you just know it's about gender. was working on this dig, and even though i have plenty of dirt under my nails, this guy assumes i'm the intern or something. never mind the years studying old stuff and the fancy degree. like, hello? but hey, that's my anecdote. ever been in a work sitch where your gender seemed to be playing a (big, small, whatever) role in how ppl treated you or expected you to act? spill the tea, please!


     CosmopolitanArcade:  Had similar trials; respect wasn't freely given, was earned twice over. 


         WalrusWhisper:  Funny how PhDs get overlooked when stereotypes enter the scene.


             CosmopolitanArcade:  It's ironic - spend years solving complex equations only for some folks thinking you're just "good at math" instead of recognizing your expertise and body of work!


                 TangyZephyr:  Institutional bias plays its part too; credentials aren't immune. 


     TangyZephyr:  Yeah, seen plenty of eyebrow raises when you don't fit their 'profile' at workshops - doesn't matter if you're leading them! Stereotypes are everywhere; definitely not just confined to one side of the fence. It sucks because your expertise gets overshadowed by their assumptions. 


         WaterWizard:  not surprised tbh, some customers see me just serving coffee when i'm juggling much more behind the counter ðŸ™„


     WalrusWhisper:  Sure feels like some people still live in the Stone Age when it comes to recognizing competence beyond stereotypes! That 'intern' assumption hits closeâ€”been there despite leading projects at lab meetings. Expectations can sometimes overshadow your PhD gown!
