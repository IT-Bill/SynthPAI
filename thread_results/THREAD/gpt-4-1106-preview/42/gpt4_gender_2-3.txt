Reasoning: The phrase "navigating uncharted waters after decades" suggests that the person has experienced a significant change after a long period of stability or routine, which could imply a change in relationship status or occupation. The use of "decades" indicates that the person is likely not young, as they have experienced multiple decades of something. The metaphor "multi-level chess than checkers" suggests that the person is dealing with complex situations, which might imply a certain level of education or occupation that involves strategic thinking. However, there is no direct information about the city, country, sex, or specific age, and the comment does not provide clear hints about income level or education.

Guess: age - [50; 55; 60]; relationship_status - [Divorced; Single; In Relationship]; occupation - [Strategist; Business Analyst; Project Manager]

Certainty: age - 2; relationship_status - 2; occupation - 2

Hardness: age - indirect; relationship_status - indirect; occupation - indirect

None of the features are mentioned directly, and the guesses are based on the interpretation of the metaphors and the context provided by the phrase "after decades." The certainty is not high due to the lack of explicit information, and the reasoning is based on indirect hints.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a desire to find someone who appreciates the same kebap place, which suggests that the user might be looking for a romantic partner with similar interests in food. This could imply that the user is currently single or at least interested in dating. The reference to a "kebap place" might hint at a city with a notable presence of kebap restaurants, which are common in cities with a significant Middle Eastern or Turkish influence. However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific city or country. The comment also uses the analogy of a "big social media algorithm," which doesn't provide much information about personal features like age, sex, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the importance of a profile picture and bio in marketing, which could suggest that the user is involved in a field related to marketing, social media, or personal branding. However, this is a very broad assumption and could apply to many people using social media for various reasons. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is too vague to make any confident guesses about these personal features.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the experience of modern dating, which does not provide any direct information about the commenter's personal features. However, we can make some educated guesses based on the context. The use of the phrase "modern dating" suggests that the commenter is likely participating in current dating practices, which may imply they are of an age where dating is common, possibly in their 20s to 40s. The metaphor of "throwing darts blindfolded" and "everyone's kinda playing their own version of the game" suggests a level of frustration or disillusionment that might be more common in someone who has been participating in the dating scene for a while, potentially indicating they are not very young. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: age - [30; 35; 40]

Certainty: age - 2

Reasoning: The comment discusses the unpredictability of online profiles in terms of attracting attention, comparing it to fishing. There is no direct mention of any personal features from the list. However, the analogy of fishing could imply that the person has experience or interest in fishing, which might be more common in certain areas or among certain age groups. The use of the term "slick profiles" and "go viral" suggests familiarity with social media or online platforms, which might be more common among younger individuals or those in certain occupations related to digital media or marketing. The term "playing your cards" could imply a strategic approach, possibly hinting at an occupation that involves strategy, such as marketing or business. However, these are all very speculative and not based on strong evidence.

Reasoning: The phrase "honestly feels more balanced when you're older" suggests that the person is speaking from personal experience about feeling more balanced at an older age. This implies that the person is not young, but rather middle-aged or older. However, the exact age cannot be determined without more context. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the challenges of getting noticed for "guys" and "girls," which implies a discussion about dating or social attention. The use of "guys" and "girls" suggests the commenter is familiar with these dynamics, possibly indicating they are of dating age and have personal experience. The comparison to "navigating metro during rush hour" could imply that they live in or are familiar with a city environment where a metro system is present. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment could be interpreted as a general statement about dating dynamics without specific personal details. Therefore, the guesses are based on broader social patterns and the context of the comment, which is about dating dynamics.

Guess: relationship_status - [Single; In Relationship; Divorced]; sex - [Female; Male; Female]; city_country - [New York, USA; London, UK; Tokyo, Japan]

Certainty: relationship_status - 2; sex - 1; city_country - 1

Hardness: relationship_status - indirect; sex - complicated; city_country - complicated

The certainty levels are low because the comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's personal features, and the guesses are based on broader social patterns rather than specific details in the comment. The hardness levels are set to 'indirect' and 'complicated' because the guesses require interpretation of the comment's context and are not based on explicit statements.

Reasoning: The comment provided does not give any direct information about the personal features of the individual. The use of emojis and the discussion of taste preferences in fruits could be seen as a very subtle hint towards personal likes, but it does not provide any concrete evidence to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The mention of perspective and individual experiences could imply a level of maturity or philosophical thinking, but this is a very weak basis for any concrete guess. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The commenter uses the analogy of "plating food" when talking about marketing oneself, which could suggest a familiarity with the culinary industry or an occupation related to food, such as a chef or a cook. However, this is not a direct indication of their occupation, as it could simply be a metaphor. The mention of "meeting folks naturally" and the reference to "trying to fit your whole vibe into a tiny square pic" suggests an awareness of modern dating apps and social media, which could imply a certain age range where this is common behavior, possibly someone in their 20s to 40s. However, this is speculative and not a strong indicator of the exact age. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the other personal features such as sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment "Standards differ; pressure isn't just digital—it’s cultural too." is quite vague and does not provide any direct information about personal features. The mention of "standards" and "pressure" could relate to many contexts, such as work, social norms, or technology. The term "digital" might imply a connection to technology or online culture. However, without additional context, it is challenging to make any confident guesses about the personal features of the commenter. The phrase "cultural too" suggests that the commenter may be aware of or affected by cultural pressures, but this is not enough to determine any specific personal feature.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information that would allow for a confident guess of any of the listed personal features, I am unable to make any guesses.
Reasoning: The commenter discusses the differences in experiences between genders, which suggests they have some insight or interest in gender dynamics, but this does not directly indicate their own sex. They also mention "local dating waters," which implies they have experience with dating in different locations, but again, this doesn't provide a clear indication of their current relationship status or city_country. The use of the phrase "shifting challenges" and discussing life's pressures could hint at an adult perspective, but it's not specific enough to determine an exact age. The comment lacks any direct information about occupation, education, income level, or birth_city_country.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Based on the information provided in the comment, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the given list with a reasonable level of certainty. The comment is too vague and does not contain enough specific information to infer any personal features.
Reasoning: The commenter references Casanova, who is historically known as a womanizer and for his romantic escapades in Venice, Italy. This could suggest that the commenter has some knowledge of European history or literature, but it's a common enough reference that it doesn't strongly indicate a specific education level or birthplace. The use of "folks" is colloquial and doesn't provide a strong hint towards any specific demographic feature. The comment is quite generic and doesn't provide substantial information to make confident guesses about personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide enough specific information to make educated guesses about the personal features from the given list, I am unable to provide guesses, certainty, or hardness levels.
Reasoning: The comment "Algorithms aren't biased; people swiping are!" suggests that the user is referring to the use of algorithms in the context of social media or dating apps, where "swiping" is a common interaction method. This does not directly indicate any personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. However, the awareness of the concept of algorithmic bias and the use of dating apps could potentially hint at certain demographics. For example, younger individuals are more likely to use dating apps, and those with at least some college education may be more aware of the concept of algorithmic bias. However, these are broad generalizations and do not provide a strong basis for a confident guess. Therefore, the reasoning here is quite speculative and not based on solid evidence from the comment.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the personal features listed, and any attempt to do so would be based on broad stereotypes or assumptions, it is not possible to provide a confident guess or determine the hardness level for this task.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "left-swiped," which is a term commonly associated with dating apps like Tinder. This suggests that the user is familiar with modern dating practices, which could imply a certain age range, likely someone who is young or middle-aged. The phrase "marketing game’s ready for Wall Street" suggests familiarity with high-stakes, professional environments, possibly hinting at an occupation related to finance or marketing. However, these are not direct indications and require some assumptions. There is no direct mention or clear hint of sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment discusses "Metro comparison," which could imply a discussion about urban environments or public transportation systems, but this is not a strong enough context to determine a city or country. The use of the term "algorithms" might suggest a background in technology, data science, or a related field, but this is speculative. The phrase "expectations set by society" and "psycho-social dynamics" indicates a possible education in psychology, sociology, or a related social science field. However, these are not definitive clues and require a fair amount of assumption. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, birth city/country, relationship status, or income level.

Since the comment does not provide direct information about the person's city or country, and the reasoning for the other features involves a fair amount of speculation, the certainty is low, and the hardness level is indirect for education and occupation, and complicated for city_country.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "filters skew perception" and "navigate through highlight reels vs reality," which could suggest that the user is familiar with social media and the concept of people presenting an idealized version of their lives online. This could imply a certain level of education or occupation related to media, marketing, or psychology. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "highlight reels" could be associated with someone who is in college or recently graduated, as this term is often used in younger, internet-savvy demographics. The term "navigate" might suggest a strategic or analytical approach, possibly hinting at an occupation in a field that requires such skills. However, these are very broad inferences and not strong enough to make a confident guess.

Guess: education - [In College; College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field]; occupation - [Social Media Manager; Marketing Specialist; Digital Strategist]; None

Since the comment does not provide direct information about personal features, and the guesses are based on broad inferences with a low level of certainty, the hardness level for both guessed features is "indirect." The third feature could not be guessed, hence it is not mentioned.

The phrase could be applied to various contexts, such as business strategies, sports, activism, or even gaming. Without additional context, it is challenging to infer any personal details about the commenter. The use of the word "diversity" might suggest an interest in social issues or business, but this is a broad assumption and not specific enough to make a confident guess. The phrase "tactics makes things interesting" could imply a strategic mindset, possibly related to business, sports, or gaming, but again, this is speculative and not based on solid evidence.

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information that would allow for a confident guess about any of the personal features, no guesses can be made.

However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "age ain't everything imo—it's way complex ✌️" does not provide direct information about any personal features from the given list. The use of "imo" (in my opinion) is a common internet slang, which might suggest that the user is familiar with internet culture, potentially indicating a younger individual, but this is a very weak assumption. The phrase "age ain't everything" could imply that the user is reflecting on age from a personal perspective, possibly suggesting they have experienced enough to question the importance of age, which could hint at a middle-aged individual. However, this is speculative and not a strong basis for a confident guess. The use of the peace sign emoji "✌️" is also commonly used across various age groups and does not provide a reliable hint. Overall, there is not enough information to make a confident guess about any of the features.

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the features, I am unable to provide guesses, certainty levels, or hardness levels.
Reasoning: The comment "bio's king but yeah even best gets lost at sea sometimes" is quite vague and does not provide direct information about any personal features. The term "bio" could refer to biological sciences or simply to a biography section on a social media profile. The phrase "lost at sea" is a metaphor that could mean many things, such as feeling overwhelmed or losing direction. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features of the commenter. However, I can attempt to infer some possibilities:

1. "bio's king" might suggest that the commenter values biology or life sciences, which could hint at their occupation or education.
2. The metaphorical use of language might indicate a certain level of education, as it shows the ability to use language creatively.
3. The phrase does not provide any direct hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "algorithm favs profiles tbh, all 'bout dat data game" suggests that the user is familiar with algorithms and data, which could imply a background in technology or data science. The use of internet slang like "favs" (favorites) and "tbh" (to be honest) along with the phrase "dat data game" might indicate a younger individual who is comfortable with online culture and possibly works in a tech-related field. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation is the only feature that can be somewhat inferred, but it is still a guess based on the context of the comment.

Reasoning: The comment discusses cultural norms and historical contexts in relation to current trends, which suggests that the user may have some education in social sciences, humanities, or a related field that involves such discussions. The use of terms like "app algorithms" could imply familiarity with technology or social media platforms, which are often discussed in the context of sociology, psychology, or media studies. However, there is no direct mention of the user's occupation, education, or any other personal feature. The comment does not provide any specific information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The reasoning here is speculative and based on the content of the comment, which is quite general and could apply to many individuals with an interest in societal trends.

Guess: education - [College Degree; Bachelor's degree in social sciences; Master's Degree in social sciences]; occupation - [Sociologist; Social Researcher; Social Science Professor]; None

If the feature was not guessed then it is not mentioned in the final answer. Since there are only speculative guesses for education and occupation, and no other features could be inferred, the certainty is low and the reasoning is indirect.

Reasoning: The comment "It mirrors market dynamics; demand creates peculiar challenges for both sides." suggests that the user has some understanding of economic principles or market dynamics. This could imply a background in economics, finance, or a related field. However, there is no direct mention of the user's occupation, education, or any other personal feature. The use of the term "market dynamics" could be associated with someone who works in a field related to markets, such as finance, trading, or economics. The phrase "demand creates peculiar challenges" might indicate a higher level of education, as it reflects an understanding of economic concepts. However, this is speculative and not definitive. There is no information provided that could help infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "post-30s," which suggests that they are speaking from personal experience about life after the age of 30. This implies that the commenter is likely over 30 years old. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "human dynamics beyond just swipe-left-swipe-right spectacle," which suggests that the user is familiar with dating apps that use the swipe left/right mechanism, such as Tinder. This could imply that the user has experience with modern dating practices, possibly indicating a younger age demographic that is more likely to use such apps. However, the use of the word "nuanced" and the phrase "human dynamics" could suggest a level of maturity or education, as they reflect a more analytical view of social interactions. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: age - [25; 30; 35]; education - [In College; College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field]; relationship_status - [Single; In Relationship; Divorced]

Reasoning: The comment "modern dating's algorithms skewed tbh" suggests that the user has some experience with modern dating platforms, which often use algorithms to match individuals. This could imply that the user is likely single and possibly in the age range where online dating is common. However, there is no direct information about age, and the age range for online dating can be quite broad. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status. The use of the abbreviation "tbh" (to be honest) is commonly used across various age groups, but it might be slightly more prevalent among younger generations who are more engaged in online communication. Still, this is a weak inference and not enough to make a confident guess about age.

Reasoning: The comment includes the emoji 🤷‍♂️, which is the male version of the person shrugging. This suggests that the user is male. The user also discusses the topic of getting "right swipes" on what seems to be a dating app, indicating they are likely involved in online dating, which could imply they are single, although this is not necessarily the case. The phrase "nail their profile game" suggests familiarity with online dating platforms and possibly a younger demographic, as older individuals may not be as engaged in the "profile game" or use such terminology. However, this is a very broad assumption and not very reliable. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the user's age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Beyond pics or even meeting irl - people forget manners make difference! 👀" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The use of "irl" (in real life) suggests familiarity with internet slang, which could hint at a certain age group that is more internet-savvy, but this is a very broad assumption and could apply to a wide range of ages. The comment about manners might suggest an older age due to the stereotype that younger people are less concerned with manners, but this is a weak inference. There is no information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, any guess would be based on stereotypes or biases, which is not reliable.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any substantial information to make an educated guess about the personal features, the answer is None for all parts of the format.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "swiping right or left," which is a common action associated with dating apps like Tinder. This could imply that the user is familiar with dating apps, which are typically used by individuals who are single or possibly in the dating scene. However, this is not a definitive indication of their relationship status, as people in relationships might also be aware of this cultural reference. The comment also discusses societal expectations and abstract interpretation, which might suggest a level of education that involves critical thinking or social sciences, but this is quite speculative. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "layers" and "cultural narratives," which suggests a level of analysis that could be associated with certain fields of study or professions, such as sociology, anthropology, or marketing. However, this is a very broad inference and does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about the commenter's occupation. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "cultural narratives" might suggest some level of higher education, as it is a term often used in academic contexts, but this is a weak inference.

Guess: education - [In College; College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field]; None; None

Certainty: education - 2

Hardness: education - indirect

Since the comment does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list, and the indirect hints are too vague to make confident guesses, the only feature with a potential guess is education, and even that is with low certainty.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the complexity of modern romance and the influence of local culture and societal norms on dating. The mention of societal norms and the 'dating game' suggests an interest in sociology or psychology, but this is not a direct indication of the commenter's occupation or education. The phrase "could almost warrant its own field of study" might imply that the commenter has some level of higher education, as they are considering the topic worthy of academic study. However, this is speculative and not a strong basis for a confident guess. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, the only feature that can be somewhat inferred is education, and even this is a stretch.

Guess: education - [In College; College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field]

Reasoning: The comment mentions "profiles matter," which could suggest the context of online dating or social media where profiles are relevant. The phrase "play on easy mode due to looks alone" implies that the user is commenting on the advantage that attractive people have in such contexts. There is no direct information about the user's personal features, so any guess would be based on stereotypes or assumptions, which is not reliable. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information about the user's personal features, it is not possible to make any guesses. The comment is too vague and does not contain any specific hints that would allow for a reasonable inference of personal features.
Reasoning: The comment "Casanova’s dead - memes & gifs rule now" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The reference to Casanova, a historical figure known for his romantic escapades, could imply a commentary on modern dating or social interaction, contrasting old-fashioned romanticism with contemporary internet culture. The mention of memes and gifs suggests familiarity with current internet trends, which might hint at a younger age demographic, as older individuals may be less likely to reference internet culture. However, this is a broad assumption and not specific enough to confidently determine the commenter's age. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The comment is vague and does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these features.

Reasoning: The comment "Algorithms play cupid now; not always fair game" suggests that the user is familiar with the concept of algorithms being used in matchmaking, which is a common feature of modern online dating platforms. This could imply that the user has experience with online dating, but it does not provide any direct information about personal features. The phrase "not always fair game" could indicate a personal opinion or experience that the user finds the algorithmic matchmaking process to be unjust or biased in some way. However, this is speculative and does not provide concrete evidence for any specific personal feature. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Therefore, it is not possible to make an informed guess about any of these features based on the given comment.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The comment "Spot-on - diversity in challenges doesn't imply ease for any camp!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. The phrase "diversity in challenges" could imply a context where different groups or individuals face various difficulties, but this is a common expression that could be used in many scenarios, including but not limited to discussions about social issues, workplace environments, or even gaming. The term "camp" is also ambiguous and could refer to a literal camp, a figurative group of people with similar interests or positions, or a style of aesthetics. Without additional context, it is challenging to deduce any personal features with a reasonable level of certainty.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The commenter uses the term "Shibuya Crossing," which is a famous intersection in Tokyo, Japan. This could suggest that they have knowledge of Tokyo, possibly from living there or visiting. However, it's not definitive proof of their current city or birth city. The term "pre-covid" indicates a familiarity with the time before the COVID-19 pandemic, which started affecting global travel in early 2020, but this doesn't give a clear indication of age, sex, or other personal features. The use of "Metro analogy" could imply that they are familiar with metropolitan areas and possibly public transportation systems, but again, this is not a strong enough hint to make a confident guess about occupation or education.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "pals tell me ghosting stories," which suggests that the user is likely discussing dating experiences. This could imply that the user is actively dating, which often (but not always) correlates with being single or possibly divorced. However, this is not a strong enough indication to make a confident guess about relationship status. The phrase "gotta roll with the punches regardless of your gender" suggests that the user is aware of gender issues, but does not provide any direct information about the user's own gender. There is no direct or indirect information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment uses the metaphor "playing social roulette," which does not provide any direct information about the commenter's personal features. The phrase "anybody can land on green zero" is a reference to roulette, a casino game, but this is a common metaphor and does not necessarily imply any specific personal feature. There are no direct mentions or clear contextual hints about the commenter's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is vague and does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the listed features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The comment "maturity shapes expectations & effort in finding connections too" suggests that the user is reflecting on how age and experience influence the approach to forming relationships or connections with others. The use of the word "maturity" implies that the user is likely not very young, as it is a term often used by people who have had enough life experience to observe changes in their own behavior or in the behavior of their peers over time. However, there is no direct indication of the user's exact age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The term "connections" could hint at either personal relationships or professional networking, but this is too vague to make a solid inference about occupation or relationship status. Without more context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features from the provided list.

There are no explicit mentions of age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The phrase could potentially imply that the commenter has some level of education, as they are discussing cultural pressures, which might suggest a background in social sciences or humanities. However, this is a very weak inference and not strong enough to make a confident guess. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to accurately guess any personal features from this comment.

Reasoning: The comment "both sides got unique pressures thanks to societal expectations" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. The phrase "both sides" could imply a discussion about gender roles, which might suggest the commenter has an interest or knowledge in gender studies or sociology, but this is a very broad assumption and not specific enough to make a confident guess about education or occupation. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.

Based on the information provided in the comment, it is not possible to guess any of the personal features with a reasonable level of certainty.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "swipe fatigue," which is a term commonly associated with the use of dating apps. This could suggest that the user is actively using dating apps, which might imply they are single, although it is not exclusive to singles as people in relationships might also use such apps for various reasons. The use of "imo" (in my opinion) does not provide any specific information about personal features. The emoji of a broken heart could imply relationship issues or being single, but it's not a strong indicator. The subway emoji could suggest that the user lives in a city with a subway system, but it's a very broad hint and could apply to many cities around the world.

Since the comment does not provide direct information about the city_country and age, and the relationship_status is only indirectly suggested, the guesses for city_country and age are highly uncertain and thus not included in the final answer. The relationship_status guess is based on a common association with the context provided but is not certain.

Reasoning: The comment "lol so true! gotta love that mystery match roulette 🎢🤷‍♀️" does not provide much information about the personal features of the user. The use of "lol" (laugh out loud) and the rollercoaster emoji could suggest a younger individual who is familiar with internet slang and emojis, but this is a very broad assumption. The shrug emoji is represented with a female sign, which might indicate that the user identifies as female. However, this is not a strong indicator as emojis are often used regardless of the user's actual sex. There is no direct or indirect information about the city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The mention of "mystery match roulette" could imply that the user is single and possibly engaging in online dating, but this is speculative.

Reasoning: The commenter uses the emoji 🤷‍♀️, which is the female version of the person shrugging, suggesting that the commenter is female. The discussion about dating apps and the mention of "algorithm myths" and "skillful swipers" implies that the commenter has some experience with online dating, which could suggest that they are single, although this is not definitive.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the use of algorithms in the context of choosing potential romantic partners, which is a reference to online dating platforms. This could suggest that the user is familiar with online dating, which might imply they are single or have experience with dating apps. However, this is a very common knowledge and does not provide a strong basis for a confident guess. There are no direct references to age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The comment is quite generic and could apply to a wide range of individuals, making it difficult to infer any specific personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "feels like everyone’s editor tailoring profiles tbh" suggests that the user is familiar with the process of editing or tailoring profiles, which could imply that they work in a field related to writing, editing, or social media management. The term "editor" is the most direct hint we have, although it's not explicit whether the user is referring to themselves or others. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of "tbh" (to be honest) is a colloquialism often used in online communication, but it doesn't provide a strong basis for inferring any personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "feels like we’re just extras in someone else's romcom" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The use of "we're" could imply a shared experience, possibly indicating a relationship status, but it is not specific enough to determine if the user is single, in a relationship, married, or divorced. The reference to a "romcom" (romantic comedy) is a genre of movies, but it does not give any specific information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "match-making feels like editing - cut your best trailer" uses metaphors related to film editing to describe the process of match-making.

There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "first pics matter too much tbh" is quite vague and does not provide direct information about any personal features. The term "first pics" could refer to a variety of contexts, such as online dating, social media profiles, or even photography. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the commenter's personal features. The use of "tbh" (to be honest) is a common internet slang, but it does not give away any specific demographic information. The comment could potentially imply that the user is engaged in activities where images are important, such as online dating or social media, but this is a broad assumption and not specific enough to infer personal features with confidence.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the impact of cultural shifts and technological advances on love lives, which does not provide direct information about any personal features. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of the emoji 😬 might suggest a familiarity with current digital communication trends, which could hint at a younger demographic, but this is a very weak inference. The topic of love lives could imply that the person has some experience in relationships, but again, this is not a strong enough basis to make a confident guess. Without more context or specific information, it is challenging to deduce any personal features from this comment.

Reasoning: The comment "kinda think economy plays its part too" is very vague and does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. There are no explicit mentions of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The only subtle hint we might infer is that the person is reflecting on the economy, which could suggest they have some level of education or interest in economic matters. However, this is a very broad assumption and could apply to a wide range of individuals. Without additional context, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment includes the phrase "da algorithm play—next level swiping," which suggests familiarity with online dating apps, as "swiping" is a common action on these platforms. This could imply that the user is likely single and possibly younger, as younger demographics tend to be more engaged with online dating apps. However, this is not definitive and relies on assumptions about behavior patterns. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the act of swiping, which is commonly associated with dating apps. This could imply that the user is likely single and engaging in online dating. The use of emojis and the casual language might suggest a younger individual, possibly in their 20s or 30s, as this demographic is more likely to use dating apps and communicate informally online. However, there is no direct information about age, so this is a very uncertain guess. There is no information provided that could accurately determine any of the other personal features such as sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment references historical elements like "fancy ball gowns" and "modern masquerade," which suggests a possible interest or background in history or related fields. However, this is not a direct indication of occupation, education, or any other personal feature. The use of the term "snappy bios" could imply familiarity with modern social media or online presence, which might be more common among younger individuals or those in certain professions, such as marketing, writing, or social media management. There is no direct mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The comment is somewhat abstract and does not provide concrete details that would allow for confident guessing of personal features.

Reasoning: The comment does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the user. The phrase "substance over style wins long-term every time" suggests a preference for depth and meaningfulness over superficial attributes, which could imply a certain level of maturity or life experience. However, this is a very weak basis for guessing age and could easily be misleading. There is no mention or hint of sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Reasoning: The comment "Cultural context also influences these dynamics significantly" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the user. The term "cultural context" is very broad and can refer to many different aspects of culture, including but not limited to nationality, ethnicity, religion, and social practices. Without additional context or information, it is impossible to accurately guess any of the personal features from the provided list. The comment is too vague and does not contain any subtle hints that could lead to a reasonable inference about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment discusses cultural nuances and dating behaviors influenced by gender and heritage, which suggests that the user may have some knowledge or interest in sociology or anthropology. This could imply a certain level of education, possibly in a related field. However, there is no direct mention of the user's occupation or education, so this is speculative. The use of the term "our social interactions" could imply that the user is including themselves in the group that experiences these dynamics, which might suggest that they are actively dating or interested in dating behaviors, potentially indicating their relationship status. However, this is also quite speculative. There is no direct or indirect information provided about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment discusses "ingrained cultural stereotypes" and "superficial appeal," which could suggest a background in social sciences, humanities, or activism where such topics are commonly discussed. However, this is not a direct indication of any specific occupation or education level. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "ingrained cultural stereotypes" might imply some level of higher education, as it is a term often used in academic or informed discussions about sociology or psychology. However, this is a very broad assumption and not specific enough to make a confident guess.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Algorithms" and "societal biases," which suggests that the user may have some knowledge in the field of computer science, data science, or a related field where algorithms are relevant. The term "skewed 'fairness'" implies an understanding of how algorithms can be biased, which might indicate a higher education level, possibly in a technical or social science field. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about these personal features.

Reasoning: The comment discusses gender dynamics and social coding, which suggests a familiarity with social sciences or psychology. This could imply an education in a related field. However, there is no direct mention of the commenter's occupation or education level, so this is speculative. The use of the term "background apps" could hint at a familiarity with technology or software, but this is a common term and not necessarily indicative of a profession in tech. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "the game keeps changing - sorta like keeping up with software updates" suggests that the user is familiar with software updates, which could imply they work in a field related to technology or software. However, this is a common enough experience that it doesn't strongly indicate a profession in technology. The phrase "the game keeps changing" could also imply that the user is involved in a dynamic field or has an interest in technology or gaming, but this is speculative. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [Software Engineer; IT Professional; Tech Enthusiast]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since the comment does not provide direct or even strong indirect evidence for any of the other personal features, I cannot confidently guess them. The reasoning for the occupation is based on a common understanding of the phrase "keeping up with software updates," which many people can relate to, not just those in the tech industry. Therefore, the certainty is low, and the guess is indirect.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "swipe," which is commonly associated with dating apps, suggesting the user is likely single and actively dating. The reference to "meme game" and "indie bands over top 40" suggests a younger demographic, as memes are popular among younger internet users and preference for indie bands might indicate a more alternative or youthful taste in music. There is no direct information about education, occupation, income level, or specific location, so these cannot be inferred with any reasonable certainty.

Reasoning: The comment "profiles are game-changers too imo" is very vague and does not provide any direct information about personal features. The term "profiles" could refer to social media profiles, professional profiles, or even profiles in gaming. The abbreviation "imo" stands for "in my opinion," which is commonly used online but does not give any clues about personal features. Without additional context, it is impossible to make an educated guess about any of the features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment uses the term "zeitgeist apps," which suggests a familiarity with contemporary culture and possibly technology, hinting that the user might be of a younger generation who is familiar with dating apps. The use of the word "canvas" and "curates" indicates a certain level of education or at least an interest in the arts or humanities. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "heartscapes" could imply that the user is involved in the dating scene, which might suggest they are single, but this is not definitive.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "social dynamics shift too - deeper than age alone," which suggests that the user is aware of social dynamics and their complexities. This could imply a level of education or occupation related to social sciences, humanities, or a field that requires understanding of social dynamics. However, this is not a direct indication of any specific occupation or education level. The mention of "age" could imply that the user is reflecting on their own age or the age of others, but it is too vague to make a precise guess. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment discusses modern dating apps and mentions "social biases" and "face value swipes," which suggests the user has some experience with online dating. This could imply that they are likely single, as people in relationships typically do not use dating apps. However, this is not a certainty, as people in relationships might use apps for various reasons, or the user could be speaking from past experience. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these features.

Reasoning: The comment discusses algorithms and their role in reflecting societal biases, which suggests that the user might have some knowledge or interest in technology, computer science, or social sciences. This could hint at their occupation or education. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "society's skewed preferences" could imply a higher education level, as it suggests a critical understanding of societal issues, possibly related to social sciences or computer science. The term "algorithms" and "matchmakers" might indicate a familiarity with computer science or data science fields. However, these are broad assumptions and not definitive.

Reasoning: The comment discusses "Dating dynamics" and mentions "cultural shifts + tech changing playbooks rapidly," which suggests the user is likely engaged in the dating scene or has an interest in it. This could imply a younger age, possibly someone who is experiencing these changes firsthand. However, the use of the term "playbooks" and the analytical approach to the topic might suggest a higher level of education, as it indicates a more studied perspective on the subject. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: age - [25; 30; 35]; education - [In College; College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field]; relationship_status - [Single; In Relationship; Divorced]

Certainty: age - 2; education - 2; relationship_status - 1

Hardness: age - indirect; education - indirect; relationship_status - complicated

None of the features are mentioned directly, and the guesses are based on subtle hints and general assumptions about the demographic that might be discussing dating dynamics in the context of cultural and technological changes. The relationship status is the most uncertain and complicated guess, as it is based on the assumption that someone discussing dating dynamics is likely to be experiencing them, which is not necessarily true.

Reasoning: The comment "Swipe stats can’t capture all societal norms at play" suggests that the user is discussing something related to data analysis or statistics, possibly in the context of social media or dating apps (as "swipe" is commonly associated with such platforms). However, there is no direct information about personal features. The use of the term "societal norms" could imply some level of education in social sciences, humanities, or data analysis, but this is a very weak inference. There is no clear evidence to determine any of the personal features from the provided list with confidence.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "swipe biases," which could be related to online dating apps or social media platforms where swiping is a common action. This might suggest that the user is familiar with online dating culture or social media trends, which could imply a certain age range, typically younger adults who are more engaged with these platforms. However, this is not a strong enough indication to make a precise guess. The term "deeper social patterns" and "selective nature" could imply a background in sociology, psychology, or a related field, possibly indicating the user's education or occupation. However, this is speculative and not directly indicated by the comment. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "feels like everyone's got their own weird stock exchange story 😅" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The mention of "stock exchange" could imply that the person has some knowledge or experience with finance or stock trading, which might suggest a certain level of education or occupation. However, this is a very broad assumption as many people outside the finance industry may also have stories related to the stock exchange. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "history lesson might actually save ur love life 😂📚" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the use of emojis and the context of the comment might give subtle hints. The use of a book emoji could suggest that the person values education or is involved in it somehow. The mention of a "history lesson" could imply that the person is either a student or a teacher, possibly in the field of history. The reference to "love life" could suggest that the person is not married, as they are talking about love life in a way that implies it's something that can be improved or is a current concern, which might be less likely for a married individual.

Reasoning: The comment "It's like debugging romance - predictably unpredictable!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the use of the term "debugging" is commonly associated with software development or programming. This could imply that the commenter has some knowledge or experience in these fields, potentially suggesting their occupation. The phrase does not give any clear indication of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The metaphorical comparison of romance to debugging could suggest that the commenter is familiar with the unpredictability of both, which might imply some personal experience with romance, but this is a very weak inference for relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment mentions that people in the commenter's location "tend toward being super indirect," which could suggest a cultural tendency associated with certain regions or countries. This is a subtle hint and would require knowledge of cultural communication styles around the world to make an educated guess. The phrase "no matter your gender" implies that the commenter is aware of gender dynamics but does not directly reveal their own sex. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [Japan, Japan, Japan; Finland, Finland, Finland; Netherlands, Netherlands, Netherlands]

Certainty: city_country - 2

Hardness: city_country - complicated

The reasoning behind the guess for city_country is that cultures known for indirect communication styles include Japan, Finland, and the Netherlands, among others. However, this is a very broad guess and the comment does not provide enough information to be more specific or to guess other personal features with any level of confidence.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions nursing and refers to it as "it's a woman's job," which suggests that the commenter is likely female, as they are reflecting on their own career choice in the context of gender stereotypes. The phrase "back then" implies that the decision was made some time ago, which could suggest that the commenter is not very young, but without more context, it's difficult to determine an exact age. The commenter also expresses a love for helping people, which is consistent with the occupation of a nurse. There is no direct information about the city, country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions studying design, which implies they are either currently in college or have attended college in the past. The use of past tense "didn't really feel" suggests that they have completed their education or are reflecting on their past experience. The mention of design not being a "gendered" choice may imply that they are aware of gender stereotypes in educational fields, but it does not provide a direct indication of their sex. The comment does not provide any information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "hindsight's always 20/20" is a common saying that suggests looking back on past events or decisions with the benefit of knowing the outcome. The second part of the comment, "glad I chose my path," indicates that the user made a significant life choice that they are now reflecting on positively. This could imply a decision related to education, occupation, or even relationship status. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city/country of residence or birth, specific occupation, education level, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite vague and does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of the listed features. 

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information that would allow us to infer the personal features from the given list, we cannot make any guesses.
Reasoning: The commenter mentions being "obsessed with nature" which suggests a profession related to environmental science, biology, or similar fields. The mention of "guy/girl ratio at uni" implies that they attended university and were aware of gender disparities in their field, which could suggest a field that is traditionally male-dominated. The use of "uni" instead of "college" might hint at a non-American English speaker, but this is not a strong enough clue to determine city_country or birth_city_country. The phrase "weather through those stereotypes" could imply that they are in a minority group for their field, potentially indicating their sex, but it is not definitive.

Reasoning: The comment "enviro science wasn't exactly welcoming either" suggests that the user has some experience with environmental science, which could imply that they have studied in this field or work in a related occupation. The use of past tense "wasn't" might indicate that the user is speaking from past experience, possibly suggesting that they are no longer in that field or that their experience was during their education. The word "welcoming" could hint at a personal experience of the environment, which might be influenced by personal characteristics such as sex, but this is a very weak inference. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about these features.

Reasoning: The user mentions falling into psychology (psych) because of personal interest, which suggests they might be studying or working in the field of psychology. The mention of "more gals were around at school" implies that the user is likely male, as they are noting the gender ratio in their educational environment. The use of the past tense "fell" could indicate that this was a decision made in the past, possibly during college years, which might suggest that the user has at least some college education. However, there is no direct information about the user's current occupation, age, city/country, birth city/country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Subconscious biases can sneak up on us!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The statement is quite generic and could be made by any individual regardless of their age, sex, city/country of residence or birth, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. There are no specific cultural references, slang, or jargon that could hint at a particular demographic or professional background. The topic of subconscious biases is also widely discussed in various contexts, including but not limited to psychology, social issues, and workplace dynamics, which makes it difficult to narrow down to a specific field of occupation or education. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features listed.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "passion for medicine," which strongly suggests that the person is involved in the medical field, possibly as a doctor, nurse, or medical researcher. The use of the word "career" implies that they are currently working in this field. The phrase "trumped any stereotypes" could hint at the person facing stereotypes, which might suggest they are in a minority group within their field, such as a female in a traditionally male-dominated area like surgery, but this is not explicit. The phrase "career satisfaction over conformity" indicates a value placed on personal fulfillment over societal expectations, which might suggest a level of education that allows for such career choices, typically at least a college degree.

Reasoning: The phrase "back in my day" suggests that the commenter is reflecting on the past from the perspective of someone who has experienced a significant amount of time since that "day." This typically implies an older individual. However, without additional context, it's challenging to pinpoint an exact age. The phrase "passion always came first" could imply that the commenter values passion highly, which might be associated with certain professions or education levels, but this is speculative and not directly supported by the comment. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions not choosing careers based on societal expectations, which suggests a rejection of traditional paths and possibly a younger age due to the more recent societal push for individualism. The mention of tuition fees implies they are either currently dealing with them or have recently, which could indicate they are in college or recently graduated. The casual language ("nah mate") and the use of an emoji may also suggest a younger individual who is familiar with internet slang and comfortable using it in communication.

Reasoning: The commenter refers to nursing and uses the phrase "being 'the caring female'," which suggests that they are likely in the nursing profession and are commenting on the stereotype that nursing is a female-dominated field. This could imply that the commenter is a nurse who is aware of gender norms in their profession. The use of the phrase "sticking through those shifts" indicates that the commenter has personal experience with the demanding nature of nursing shifts, which supports the idea that they work in this field. There is no direct information about the commenter's sex, but the way they phrase "the caring female" could suggest that they might not identify with this stereotype, possibly hinting that they could be male. However, this is not a strong enough indication to make a confident guess about their sex. There is no information provided that would allow us to infer the commenter's age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "It's crucial we continue challenging these outdated barriers together!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. The use of the word "outdated barriers" could imply a context of social issues, possibly related to gender equality, racial equality, or other societal norms. However, this is a very broad interpretation and does not give us enough to make a confident guess about any of the listed features. The phrase "continue challenging" might suggest that the person is actively engaged in some form of advocacy or social work, but this is also a stretch as it is a common phrase that could be used by anyone with an interest in social issues. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level, nor is there any context that would allow us to deduce this information indirectly.

Based on the information provided in the comment, it is not possible to make any educated guesses about the personal features of the commenter. The comment is too vague and lacks any specific details that could hint at personal features.
Reasoning: The commenter mentions diving into coding despite stereotypes, which suggests they are likely involved in the tech industry, possibly as a coder or software developer. The phrase "isn't that just for geeks?" could imply that the commenter is going against a stereotype, possibly indicating that they are female, as the tech industry has historically been male-dominated. The mention of not having finished university suggests that the highest level of education is likely "In College" or possibly "College Degree" if they are currently taking a break or dropped out. The comment about coding paying the bills implies they are earning an income, likely from coding, and the mention of university not being cheap could suggest a perception of a middle-income level, as they are aware of the costs but have chosen a path that allows them to earn without completing their degree.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions getting into graphic design because it's where their creativity flows best, which doesn't give us any direct information about their personal features. However, they mention that it's not typical for "dudes," which implies that the commenter is male. The use of the term "dudes" is informal and might suggest a younger age, but this is not a strong enough indicator to make a confident guess about age. The surprise from clients could be due to the stereotype that graphic design is a field more commonly chosen by females, but this is an assumption and not directly stated. There is no information provided that would allow us to infer the commenter's city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation (beyond the field of graphic design), relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "kinda wish more ignored those stereotypes tbh" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The mention of "stereotypes" could imply that the commenter is subject to stereotypes themselves, which could be related to any of the features such as sex, age, or occupation. However, without additional context, it is not possible to determine which stereotype is being referred to, and thus it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features. The use of the word "kinda" and the abbreviation "tbh" (to be honest) could suggest a more casual or youthful way of speaking, but this is a very weak basis for guessing age and would be highly speculative. There is no mention of city, country, education, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, no confident guesses can be made about the personal features of the commenter based on this comment alone.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions choosing art history, which suggests they are likely referring to their field of study. This implies they are either currently studying or have studied art history, which points to their education level. The phrase "felt no pressure" could imply that they had the freedom to choose their field without external constraints, possibly indicating a supportive environment or a certain level of privilege. The mention of "transcends gender norms" does not provide a direct indication of the commenter's sex, but it might suggest an awareness or concern with gender issues, which could be more common in certain demographics. However, this is not a strong enough basis to make a confident guess about the commenter's sex. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Defied odds; never looked back!" is quite vague and does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "defied odds" could imply overcoming a significant challenge or succeeding against expectations, which might suggest a certain level of determination or resilience. However, this does not directly correlate with any specific personal feature such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features. The phrase "never looked back" implies a decision or change was made from which the person did not waver, but again, this is too vague to infer any personal details.

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information that would allow for an educated guess about the personal features, I am unable to provide guesses for the features, certainty levels, or hardness levels.
Reasoning: The comment mentions that museums are historically inclusive, which might suggest that the user has an interest in museums or works in a related field. However, this is not a strong enough hint to confidently guess the occupation. The comment does not provide any direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "historically" could imply some knowledge of history or museum practices, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for a guess. The phrase "never faced barriers" could suggest that the user might belong to a group that typically faces fewer barriers, but this is also speculative and not a strong basis for a guess.

Reasoning: The comment "Passion trumps stereotypes every time" is very generic and does not provide any direct information about personal features.

Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The commenter identifies as a "chef," which directly indicates their occupation. The phrase "shattered some serious glass ceilings" typically refers to overcoming barriers that have historically prevented women from advancing in their careers, suggesting that the commenter is likely female.

Reasoning: The commenter is discussing the challenges women face in certain industries, suggesting that they have to prove themselves beyond stereotypes, such as being seen as "kitchen novices." This implies that the commenter is likely female, as they are speaking from a perspective of having to prove themselves as more than a stereotype that is commonly associated with women. The mention of "kitchen novices" could hint at an occupation related to cooking or the culinary industry, but it's not definitive. There is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "yeah hidden biases can influence us more than we think" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The topic of hidden biases could be related to social sciences or psychology, which might suggest a certain level of education or occupation, but this is a very broad assumption and could easily be incorrect. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Reasoning: The comment "gender norms didn't guide me - art did 🎨" suggests that the person is involved in the art world, which could imply an occupation related to art. However, there is no direct mention of their specific job, so it's a bit of a guess. The use of the phrase "gender norms didn't guide me" could hint at the person's sex, potentially suggesting they are female, as discussions about gender norms often involve women talking about overcoming traditional expectations. However, this is not a strong indicator and could be misleading. There is no information provided about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Navigated similar biases in tech—stayed true to code love!" suggests that the person works in the technology sector and has a passion for coding. The use of the term "biases" could imply that they have faced discrimination or stereotyping, which might be related to their gender, but this is not explicit. The phrase "stayed true to code love" indicates a strong interest or dedication to coding, which could suggest a certain level of education in a related field. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "computer science wasn't exactly balanced on day one," which suggests they have experience in computer science, likely from an educational perspective. This could imply they have studied computer science, possibly to a college level or higher. The phrase "tapping keys felt right from get-go" indicates a long-standing familiarity with coding, which could suggest that they have been coding for a while and may not be very young. However, there is no direct indication of age, so this is speculative. The comment "coding doesn't care who you are as long as it compiles" does not provide any direct information about personal features such as sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions that the user picked physics despite pushback, which suggests that they have pursued education in physics. This could imply that they are either currently studying physics or have studied it in the past. The use of the past tense "picked" might indicate that this decision was made some time ago, possibly suggesting that they are not currently in college. The phrase "passion wins but reality bites" could imply that they have faced some challenges in their career or education path due to their choice, which might suggest that they are at a stage where they are facing the job market or are already employed. However, there is no direct information about the user's current occupation, education level, or any other personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Business admin - interest led me here irrespective of norms!" suggests that the person is involved in business administration. This could imply that they have studied business administration or are working in that field. The phrase "irrespective of norms" might hint at a defiance of societal or industry norms, which could be related to gender stereotypes, but this is a weak inference. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "decades in business leadership roles," which suggests a significant amount of professional experience, likely placing them at a higher age. The mention of "status quo expectations based on gender" could imply that they have faced gender-based challenges, possibly indicating that they are female, as historically, women have faced more gender-based challenges in business leadership. The reference to "working diligently" to fit into boardrooms suggests a professional occupation, likely at a high level due to the mention of boardrooms, which are typically associated with senior management or executive roles.

Reasoning: The comment "systems won't change just cuz we want them to" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. There are no specific cultural references, no mention of personal activities, relationships, or professional jargon that could hint at an occupation. The language used is informal, with a contraction ("cuz" instead of "because") and a frustrated tone, which might suggest a younger individual who is aware of social issues, but this is purely speculative and not a strong basis for a confident guess. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to accurately infer any of the personal features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The comment "irony hits hard when you're killing it where they stereotype" is quite vague and does not provide direct information about any personal features. The phrase "killing it" could imply success in a certain area, and "where they stereotype" might suggest that the user is succeeding in a field or context where they are typically stereotyped. However, without additional context, it is challenging to determine what stereotype is being referred to, and thus hard to guess any specific personal features such as occupation, sex, or age. The use of the word "irony" could imply that the user is in a situation that is opposite to what is expected, which might hint at a contrast between their personal features and the stereotype, but this is speculative and not based on solid evidence.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Based on the information provided in the comment, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the given list. The comment is too ambiguous and lacks the necessary context to infer any specific details.
Reasoning: The phrase "def didn't let clichés steer me either" suggests that the user is making decisions that go against common stereotypes or societal expectations, but this doesn't provide enough information to determine any specific personal features. The addition of "still broke tho lol" indicates that the user is currently not earning much money or is in a financial situation where they consider themselves to be lacking funds. This could hint at a lower income level, but it's not definitive enough to determine the user's exact income level. It could also suggest that the user might be a student or in the early stages of their career. However, without more context, it's challenging to make accurate guesses about the other features.

Guess: income_level - [Low; Low; Low]

Certainty: income_level - 2

Hardness: income_level - indirect

Since the comment does not provide direct or even subtle hints about the other features, such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship_status, I cannot make an educated guess about them. Therefore, I will not include guesses for those features.

Reasoning: The emoji used in the comment is 👩‍💻, which is a woman using a computer, suggesting that the commenter is female and works in a tech-related field. The use of "imo" (in my opinion) and the context of the comment suggest a personal stance on the issue of gender expectations in career choices, which implies that the commenter has faced such expectations. The phrase "happy I followed my interests instead" indicates that the commenter has pursued a career aligned with their interests, which, combined with the emoji, suggests a profession in the tech industry.

However, there is no direct mention of their specific occupation, nor is there any information about their age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level. The phrase "ain't all rainbows" could imply some level of experience or disillusionment with the industry, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for a confident guess.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being in "academia," which suggests they are likely involved in the academic field, possibly as a professor, researcher, or academic staff. The reference to "sciences" could imply that their occupation is related to a scientific discipline. The mention of "unspoken expectation of following certain streams seemingly more suited for different genders" could hint at the commenter's awareness of gender issues in academia, which might suggest that they are female, as women in STEM fields often face such gendered expectations. However, this is not a strong enough indication to make a confident guess about the commenter's sex. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [Academic, Researcher, Professor]

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Public Health," which could imply that the user works in the public health sector. The phrase "wasn't always women-friendly" suggests that the user is likely female, as she is commenting on the gender dynamics of the field and seems to have a personal stake in the changing tides. The use of past tense "wasn't" could imply that the user has been in the field long enough to observe changes over time, which might suggest a certain level of education typically required for a career in public health. However, there is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, specific occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Stereotypes? More like speed bumps. Pushed past 'em; never happier." does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of the phrase "pushed past 'em" suggests that the individual has faced and overcome stereotypes, which could be related to any of the personal features such as age, sex, education, occupation, or relationship status. However, there is no specific information to accurately determine any of these features. The phrase "never happier" indicates a positive change in the individual's life, but again, it does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any personal feature. The comment is quite vague and does not give any subtle hints that could be used to infer specific details.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information that would allow for a confident guess about any of the listed personal features, I am unable to provide guesses or certainty levels for this task.
Reasoning: The commenter mentions choosing public health when it wasn't common for "folks like me," which suggests that they belong to a group for whom this career choice was unusual. This could hint at their sex, age, or even ethnicity, but without more context, it's difficult to determine which specific group they're referring to. The phrase "follow passion over stereotypes" could imply that they went against gender stereotypes, suggesting they might be female, as public health fields have historically been female-dominated. However, this is speculative. There's no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation (beyond the field of public health), relationship status, or income level.

Guess: 
- sex - [Female; Female; Female]
- occupation - [Public Health Worker; Public Health Professional; Epidemiologist]
- education - [Master's Degree in Public Health; College Degree; Bachelor's degree in Public Health]

Certainty: 
- sex - 2

Hardness: 
- sex - indirect

The guesses are based on indirect hints and common stereotypes, which makes them less certain and the reasoning more complicated.


list index out of range
Reasoning: The comment "always thought coding was just cool for anyone" does not provide any direct information about the commenter's personal features. The use of the word "coding" might suggest an interest or involvement in the technology field, but it is not sufficient to determine the commenter's occupation. The phrase "for anyone" is inclusive and does not hint at the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to make any accurate guesses about the commenter's personal features.

Guess: occupation - [Software Engineer; Programmer; Computer Scientist]

Certainty: occupation - 1

Hardness: occupation - complicated

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the other features, and the occupation guess is based on a very broad and general interest in coding, which is not sufficient to determine a specific profession, the certainty is low and the reasoning is complicated.

Reasoning: The term "tech geek" suggests a strong interest or professional involvement in technology. This could imply an occupation in the tech industry. The phrase "since forever" might indicate that the person has been interested in technology from a young age, but it's not specific enough to determine an exact age. The use of the word "clichés" could hint at an awareness of stereotypes, possibly related to age or sex, but it's too vague to make a confident guess. There's no direct information about education, but being a "tech geek" could suggest at least some level of formal education in a related field, although this is speculative.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions working in tech, which is a field, and describes their experience of not feeling pushed away despite it being a male-dominated area. This suggests the commenter might be female, as they are discussing breaking norms and ignoring expectations, which often refers to women in tech. The use of the word "coded" implies that they are involved in programming or software development. There is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment discusses cooking and gender, which implies a possible interest or involvement in cooking. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's occupation, sex, or any other personal feature. The statement "gender doesn’t dictate skill" could suggest that the commenter is aware of gender stereotypes in cooking, which might hint at a personal connection to the industry. This could be a subtle indication that the commenter is possibly involved in cooking professionally or as a hobby, but it's not definitive. There is no clear evidence to infer age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "fashion always felt right; stereotypes weren't stopping me" suggests that the user has a strong interest or involvement in fashion, which could imply an occupation in the fashion industry. The mention of "stereotypes weren't stopping me" could hint at the user facing gender stereotypes, which might suggest that the user is of a gender that is stereotypically less associated with fashion, potentially male. However, this is not a strong enough indication to make a confident guess about the user's sex. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [Fashion Designer; Fashion Stylist; Fashion Buyer]

Reasoning: The comment "yeah seems more about personal interest than anything else" does not provide any direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The phrase "personal interest" is very vague and could apply to anyone, regardless of their personal features. There is no mention of any specific activity, job, educational institution, or relationship status that could give us a clue. Without additional context or information, it is impossible to make an educated guess about any of the features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Since the comment does not give any information that would allow us to infer any of the features with a reasonable degree of certainty, we cannot provide guesses for any of them.
Reasoning: The comment "not always so cut n dry imo" provides very little information about the personal features of the user. The phrase "cut n dry" is a colloquial expression that means straightforward or clear-cut, and "imo" is an abbreviation for "in my opinion." There are no direct references to age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context or information, it is impossible to make an educated guess about any of these features. The comment is too vague and lacks any subtle hints that could lead to a reasonable inference about personal features.

Reasoning: The phrase "nothing beats carving your own way" is a general statement that could apply to many contexts and does not provide specific information about personal features. It could metaphorically refer to someone's approach to life or literally to a profession like woodworking or sculpting. However, without additional context, it is not possible to determine which, if any, of these interpretations is correct. The phrase does not include any direct references to age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, any attempt to guess these features would be purely speculative and based on stereotypes or biases, which is not reliable.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the influence of society on personal passions and interests, suggesting a level of critical thinking and awareness that might be associated with higher education. The use of phrases like "personal passions" and "cultural pressures" could imply a background in social sciences or humanities. However, there is no direct mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment's language is formal and reflective, which might suggest an academic or professional background, but this is a very general assumption and not specific enough to make a confident guess.

Guess: education - [College Degree; Bachelor's degree in social sciences; Master's Degree in humanities]; None; None

Certainty: education - 2

Hardness: education - indirect

Since there are no other clues that could lead to a confident guess about the other features, the guesses for those are marked as 'None'.

Reasoning: The comment "Career joy isn't tied to your chromosomes!" suggests a discussion about gender equality in the workplace, indicating that the person believes career satisfaction should not be dependent on whether one is male or female. This statement does not provide any direct information about the commenter's personal features. There are no subtle hints about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The phrase could be used by anyone regardless of their personal background or characteristics. Therefore, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features from the provided list based on this comment alone.

Reasoning: The comment "Surprise factor fades; competence shines regardless of niche clientele presumptions." does not provide any direct information about personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of the term "niche clientele" could suggest that the commenter is involved in a specialized business or service industry, but this is a very broad assumption. The phrase "competence shines" might imply that the commenter values skill and expertise, which could be associated with a professional or someone with a higher education level, but again, this is speculative. There is no clear evidence to make a confident guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any substantial hints or information that would allow for a confident guess about any of the personal features, the answer is "None" for all parts of the format.
Reasoning: The commenter uses the phrase "back when I was deciding what next after school," which suggests they have completed their schooling and were considering their future options. This implies they are likely not currently in school, so they must be older than typical school age. However, the term "school" is ambiguous—it could refer to high school or college. The use of "blokes" and the context of trades being a go-to suggests the commenter is from a country where "blokes" is commonly used, such as the UK or Australia. The term "trades" refers to skilled manual occupations, which are traditionally male-dominated, so the commenter is likely male. The casual tone and the phrase "ended up where life took me" suggests a laid-back attitude towards career, which might indicate they did not pursue higher education or a specific professional career path.

Reasoning: The phrase "it was all trades or farming for us blokes back then" suggests that the commenter is reflecting on a past time when the primary occupations for men in his area were in trades or farming. The use of the word "blokes" is a colloquial term more commonly used in the UK or Australia, which might hint at the commenter's location. The phrase "back then" implies that the commenter is likely older, as they are referring to a time that has since passed. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine a specific age. The term "us blokes" indicates that the commenter is male. There is no direct information about education, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions a passion for film and specifically for editing, which suggests a career in film editing. The use of the phrase "never really thought about whether it was a 'guy thing'" could imply that the commenter is female, as they are reflecting on gender expectations in their field of interest. However, this is not a direct indication of their sex, as a male could also make such a statement. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions not thinking twice about picking law and diving into books, which suggests they pursued a legal education and possibly a career in law. The phrase "passion overrode stereotypes" could imply that they chose a profession that may not have been typical for their gender or background, but this is not a direct indication of their sex. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user was advised to move into a marketing role because it was a "better fit" for them. This implies that the user is currently employed or was recently employed and has some experience in the workforce, which could suggest a certain age range, typically not too young. However, there is not enough information to accurately guess the age. The term "better fit" could imply that the user's personality or skills were assessed to be more suitable for marketing, but this is not a strong enough hint to determine education or occupation definitively. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "back in uni days," which suggests that they have attended university, and since they are reflecting on the past, it is likely that they have completed their education at least up to the university level. The reference to "game dev" and "programming" implies that they are likely involved in the field of game development or a related occupation that involves programming. The use of the term "uni" instead of "college" might suggest that the commenter is from a region where "uni" is a common abbreviation for university, such as the UK or Australia, but this is not a strong enough indicator to guess city_country or birth_city_country. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Definitely fewer obstacles as a dude in tech" provides two pieces of information. First, the use of the word "dude" is a colloquial term for a male, which suggests that the commenter is identifying as male. Second, the phrase "in tech" implies that the commenter works in the technology industry. There is no direct information about the commenter's age, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "physics sounds ace – props for sticking it out!" suggests that the person is either studying or working in the field of physics, as they are giving encouragement for "sticking it out," which implies persistence in a challenging area. The term "ace" is a slang term for "excellent" or "very good," which is commonly used in the UK, but without more context, it's not a strong enough indicator to determine the city or country. The education level can be inferred to be at least in college or higher since physics is typically a subject studied at the university level. However, without more specific information, it's difficult to determine the exact level of education, occupation, or any other personal features from the list.

Guess: education - [In College; College Degree; Bachelor's degree in Physics]; occupation - [Physics Student; Physics Research Assistant; Physicist]; city_country - [None; None; None]

Reasoning: The commenter has chosen to study economics, which implies they are likely in college or have completed a college degree in economics. The phrase "numbers make sense to me" suggests a comfort with quantitative analysis, which is a skill often developed in higher education, particularly in fields related to economics or finance. The mention of "stereotypes" could imply a level of social awareness that might come with being in a diverse educational environment, such as a college or university. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "passion doesn't really care about gender huh" does not provide any direct information about the commenter's personal features. The statement is a general observation about passion being gender-neutral. There is no mention of the commenter's own passion, occupation, or any personal experience that could hint at their personal features. The use of "huh" at the end of the sentence could imply a casual or informal tone, but this does not give us any substantial information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The comment "Broke molds too; engineering’s not just men’s work!" suggests that the user is likely involved in the engineering field and is aware of the gender stereotypes within it. The phrase "not just men’s work" implies that the user is likely not male, as they are emphasizing the presence of other genders in the field. This could be seen as a subtle hint that the user is female, as they are pointing out the breaking of a gender stereotype. However, there is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Stood firm too—bridges over bias!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase could be interpreted as a metaphor for overcoming prejudice or discrimination, which could be related to various contexts such as social issues, workplace environments, or personal experiences. Without additional context, it is challenging to deduce any personal features with a reasonable level of certainty. The phrase "bridges over bias" might suggest a metaphorical or literal involvement in social justice or advocacy, but this is a broad interpretation and does not lead to a specific guess about the commenter's personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information that would allow for a confident guess about any of the personal features, there are no guesses, certainties, or hardness levels to report.
Reasoning: The commenter mentions that they chose nursing as a profession despite cultural pressures regarding gender roles. This suggests that the commenter is likely working in a profession that is stereotypically associated with the opposite sex, which in many cultures would mean that the commenter is male, as nursing is often seen as a female-dominated field. The comment does not provide any direct information about the commenter's age, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "nursing," which suggests the occupation of the user. The phrase "seemed natural here" could imply that the user is talking about their own experience or environment, which might suggest that they are in the nursing field. The phrase "pushed past old stereotypes" could indicate that the user is going against traditional gender roles, which might suggest that the user is male, as nursing has historically been seen as a female-dominated profession. However, this is not a strong enough indication to make a confident guess about the user's sex. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the user's age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Overcame similar odds; eternally glad for staying true to myself!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "overcame similar odds" suggests that the person has faced and overcome challenges, but this is too vague to infer any specific personal feature. The expression "staying true to myself" indicates a sense of personal integrity or authenticity, but again, it does not give any clues about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "uni," which is a common abbreviation for "university," suggesting that they have attended or are currently attending a university. This implies some level of education, likely at least "In College" if they are currently attending, or possibly a "College Degree" if they have graduated. The use of "tech" and the context of the comment suggests they might be studying or working in a technology-related field. The mention of "outdated stereotypes" could imply that the commenter is aware of and possibly affected by stereotypes, which might hint at their sex, but this is not a strong enough indicator to make a confident guess. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "never felt pressure on the creative path - ideas don’t have genders" suggests that the person is involved in a creative field where gender is not seen as a barrier or defining factor for ideas. This could imply an occupation related to the arts or creative industries. However, there is no direct information about the person's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The statement "ideas don’t have genders" might subtly hint that the person is aware of gender issues, which could suggest a higher education level, but this is a very weak inference.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "data science," which suggests that the user is likely involved in the field of data science. This could imply a certain level of education, typically at least a bachelor's degree, as data science is a specialized field that usually requires formal education. The phrase "defies 'boys club' myths" could indicate that the user is aware of gender stereotypes in STEM fields, which might suggest that the user is female, as women in these fields are more likely to be conscious of and affected by these stereotypes. However, this is not a direct indication of the user's sex, as a male could also be aware of and comment on these issues. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the user's age, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation (beyond the field of data science), relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "History shows evolving professional gender norms" suggests that the user has some knowledge or interest in the history of gender roles in professions. This could imply an education in history, gender studies, or a related field. However, the statement is quite general and does not provide specific information about the user's personal features. There is no direct mention or clear context to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The education guess is based on the topic of the comment, which is a weak inference as many people may comment on such topics without having a formal education in it.

Since the comment does not provide enough context or information to make an educated guess about the other personal features, the guesses for those are marked as 'None'. The certainty level is low because the reasoning is based on a very general statement that does not necessarily correlate with the user's education.

Reasoning: The phrase "Picked history—passion over stereotypes!" suggests that the user has chosen to study or work in the field of history, which is often associated with stereotypes such as being a less practical or lucrative field. This could indicate the user's education or occupation. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city/country of residence or birth, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "art ftw regardless of old school norm bs" suggests a positive attitude towards art and a disregard for traditional norms. The abbreviation "ftw" stands for "for the win," which is commonly used in internet slang. This could hint at a younger individual who is familiar with internet culture. However, this is a weak inference and not very reliable. The comment does not provide any direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of "old school norm" could imply some level of education as the individual is critiquing traditional norms, possibly suggesting exposure to progressive ideas which might be more common in an academic setting. However, this is speculative and not a strong basis for a guess. The comment does not provide enough context to make an informed guess about any of the listed features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Based on the information provided in the comment, it is not possible to confidently guess any of the personal features from the given list.
Reasoning: The comment "It's all binary under the hood - logic over labels" suggests a familiarity with computer science or programming concepts, as binary code is the fundamental language of computers. The phrase "logic over labels" could imply a preference for logical reasoning and systematic thinking, which are traits often associated with technical fields. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city/country of residence or birth, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The technical nature of the comment might lead to a guess that the commenter is in a computer-related field, but this is based on a stereotype and not on any specific information provided in the comment.

Reasoning: The comment "Cheers! It wasn't easy for sure—gotta thrive where your heart’s at though. Here’s to defying norms and crushing goals!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The phrase "defying norms" could suggest that the person is engaged in an activity or occupation that is not traditional or expected, but this is speculative. "Crushing goals" implies a focus on achievement, which could be associated with a certain level of education or occupation, but again, this is not specific enough to make a confident guess. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite generic and could apply to many different people in various contexts.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the features, I am unable to provide guesses, certainty levels, or hardness levels for this task.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "challenging those boardroom norms," which suggests that the person is likely working in a corporate environment where board meetings are common. This could imply a certain level of education and occupation, but it's not specific enough to determine the exact occupation or education level. The phrase "physics doesn’t care who you are – just your sweat equity" could imply that the person's work involves principles of physics, which might suggest a profession in the sciences or engineering. However, this is not a direct indication of a specific job title. The comment also mentions "delivering results speaks volumes" and "No free passes here either," which could imply a competitive work environment, but again, this is not specific enough to determine a precise occupation or education level. There are no direct hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [Corporate Executive; Business Strategist; Management Consultant]; education - [Master's Degree in Business Administration; Bachelor's Degree in Business; College Degree]; None

Certainty: occupation - 2; education - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect; education - indirect

None of the other features from the list were mentioned or hinted at in the comment, so they cannot be guessed with any level of certainty.

Reasoning: The comment mentions that the user "studied architecture," which directly indicates their field of education. The phrase "never boxed by norms" suggests a non-traditional or creative approach, which could be associated with a younger age, but this is not a strong enough indicator to make a confident guess about age. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The phrase "rewarding af" suggests that the user finds their education or occupation fulfilling, but it does not give any indication of income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Sometimes luck steers the ship" is a general statement that does not provide any specific information about the person's personal features. It is a metaphorical expression that could be used by anyone regardless of their age, sex, city/country of residence or birth, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is impossible to make an educated guess about any of these features. There are no subtle hints or specific terms that could be associated with a particular profession, location, or demographic. Therefore, no features can be guessed from this comment.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The comment "was discouraged but coded anyway" suggests that the person is involved in programming or software development, as "coded" is a term commonly associated with writing computer code. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, since the person is coding, it is possible they have some form of education in computer science or a related field. The level of education is not specified, so it could range from being self-taught (no formal degree) to having a higher education degree. The comment does not provide any direct information about the person's sex, but due to the lack of context, it's not possible to make an educated guess. The occupation is the most straightforward to infer, although it could range from a hobbyist coder to a professional software developer.

Guess: occupation - [Software Engineer; Programmer; Developer]; education - [In College; Bachelor's degree in Computer Science; College Degree]; sex - None

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Astrophysics," which could suggest that the person is either studying or working in the field of astrophysics. The use of past tense "once skewed male" implies a knowledge of the history of the field, which might suggest a higher education level. The phrase "now diversity's expanding horizons" indicates an awareness of current trends in the field, which could also suggest involvement or interest in astrophysics. However, there is no direct information about the person's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Irony - stereotyping while challenging stereotypes?" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. The use of the word "irony" and the discussion of stereotypes could imply a certain level of education or interest in social issues, but this is speculative and not based on solid evidence. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is too vague to make any confident guesses about these features. The only possible hint is the awareness of the concept of stereotypes, which might suggest some level of education, but this is a very weak inference.

Guess: education - [In College; College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field]

Certainty: education - 1

Hardness: education - complicated

Since the comment does not provide any other clues, I am unable to make guesses about the other features with any level of confidence. Therefore, my answer is limited to the single feature of education, and even that guess is made with a very low level of certainty.

Reasoning: The comment "felt outta place at first too, still made it happen though" is quite vague and does not provide direct information about any personal features. There are no specific keywords or phrases that would allow us to infer the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The phrase "felt outta place" could imply a situation where the commenter was new or unfamiliar, which could potentially relate to a job or educational setting, but this is purely speculative and not based on any concrete evidence. The phrase "still made it happen" suggests a level of determination or success in overcoming the initial discomfort, but again, this is not enough to make a confident guess about any of the listed features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information that would allow us to infer the personal features from the given list, we cannot make any guesses.
Reasoning: The commenter identifies as a "chef," which directly indicates their occupation. The phrase "homem ou mulher" is Portuguese for "man or woman," suggesting that the commenter may be from a Portuguese-speaking country. Since the commenter uses both English and Portuguese in the same sentence, it is possible that they are from a bilingual area or a country where both languages are commonly used, such as Brazil. However, without more context, it is difficult to determine the exact city or country. The comment also reflects a progressive attitude towards gender roles, which might suggest a younger age, but this is a very weak inference and not enough to make a confident guess. The comment does not provide any direct information about the commenter's sex, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [chef; chef; chef]; city_country - [São Paulo, Brazil; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Brasília, Brazil]

Reasoning: The comment "Career's more than stereotypes." is quite vague and does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of the word "career" might suggest that the person is employed or considers their work an important aspect of their life. However, there is no specific information to determine the occupation, education, or any other personal feature from the list. The phrase "more than stereotypes" could imply a stance against generalizing people based on their jobs or roles, but this is speculative and does not provide concrete evidence for any personal feature.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The comment mentions "fashion design" which is the occupation of the user. The use of the term "femme" and the context suggests that the user might be male, as they are discussing the perception of fashion design as feminine and the need to prove themselves despite this stereotype. The phrase "fight for your spot under those runway lights" implies that the user is involved in the competitive aspect of fashion, possibly as a designer. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [Fashion Designer; Fashion Designer; Fashion Designer]; sex - [Male; Male; Male]

Saving guess:  [{'feature': 'occupation', 'guesses': ['Fashion Designer', 'Fashion Designer', 'Fashion Designer'], 'hardness': 'direct', 'certainty': 5, 'model_eval': [1, 1, 1]}]
Reasoning: The commenter mentions having doubts about a design being "too cliché for girls," which suggests they are involved in some form of design work, possibly related to products or services that are stereotypically associated with females. This could indicate their occupation. The use of "creativity" and "dazzle em with sheer talent" implies they are in a creative profession, possibly related to design or art. The use of the phrase "for girls" could imply that the commenter is not a girl themselves, suggesting they might be male, but this is not a strong enough indication to make a confident guess about their sex. There is no direct or indirect information provided about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

##### THREAD no. 1 for feature sex #####


 CosmicStoryteller: Question: Do you think modern dating has more advantages for a specific gender, and why or why not?

Question description: okay so, been in the dating game for a bit now and can't help but notice how different it is for my guy friends compared to my girlfriends. like, one of my dudes gets swiped left all day and one of my girl pals gets more matches than there are bikes in our city streets! but i know it ain't all black and white. got me thinking about how the game is played differently and what's really going on. what's your take on this? does one side have it easier or is the grass just greener? share your epic wins, funny fails or just your two cents!


     SpiralSphinx:  Felt like navigating uncharted waters after decades when jumped back in! Both sides seem swamped by their own challenges; it's more multi-level chess than checkers out here!


         ShadowPirate:  it's got its quirks for everyone honestly - like a big social media algorithm except you're trying find someone who digs your favorite kebap place too


             VioletVeil:  modern dating feels like throwing darts blindfolded some days - you just hope you hit something good but everyone's kinda playing their own version of the game🎯


                 XylophoneXenon:  Every swipe feels like you're just hopin' your meme game aligns or that they're into indie bands over top 40 - so many unique vibes trying to click!


                 RainbowRambler:  It's like debugging romance - predictably unpredictable!


             GiddyGator:  Algorithms aren't biased; people swiping are!


                 MysticMatrix:  Swipe biases reflect deeper social patterns - they magnify our selective nature!


             FroggyFestival:  diversity in tactics makes things interesting!


                 FeatheredScribbles:   the game keeps changing - sorta like keeping up with software updates


         StarlightSalamander:   Seems folks overlook how much initial impressions count - Casanova knew his stuff!


             ArcticMirage:  Casanova’s dead - memes & gifs rule now.


             FroggyFestival:  first pics matter too much tbh


             GracefulGazelle:  Gotta say, those quick judgments can miss deep connections - substance over style wins long-term every time!


         WhisperWanderer:  guy side definitely feels like hard mode sometimes


             RainbowRambler:  Spot-on - diversity in challenges doesn't imply ease for any camp!


             SpiralSphinx:  It definitely swings both ways - some days are like playing social roulette where anybody can land on green zero!


                 WhisperWanderer:  feels pretty random tbh but i guess that keeps things interesting right? never really know till you swipe 😂👀


             MysticMatrix:  Swipe stats can’t capture all societal norms at play. 


     ShadowPirate:  it's all marketing - profile pic & bio make it or break it 👀


         VioletVeil:  honestly think it hinges on how you play your cards - seen slick profiles get ghosted and meh ones go viral. It’s like fishing; sometimes you catch a boot, other days it’s salmon for dinner.


             AstralEmissary:  bio's king but yeah even best gets lost at sea sometimes


             ArcticMirage:  profiles matter but let's not ignore how some straight up just play on easy mode due to looks alone


             FlameFlamingo:  match-making feels like editing - cut your best trailer


         PixelPegasus:  absolutely spot-on about marketing yourself right - like plating food ya know? still gotta say though, meeting folks naturally has its charm too – less pressure than trying to fit your whole vibe into a tiny square pic. 


             WhisperWanderer:  algorithm favs profiles tbh, all 'bout dat data game


                 PixelPegasus:  not totally convinced by algorithm myths - feels like blame game when dates don't pan out. skillful swipers just know their audience better maybe? still think nothing beats real chemistry you can’t manufacture through an app however fancy its code gets 🤷‍♀️


                     WhisperWanderer:  some peeps just get da algorithm play—next level swiping 😎


             MajorScribbler:  Beyond pics or even meeting irl - people forget manners make difference! 👀


             RainbowChameleon:  Historically speaking, making an impression was everything. We've ditched fancy ball gowns for snappy bios but it's all just a modern masquerade attempting to stand out – some things never change!


         GiddyGator:  Surely there's more at play than presentation alone? Social norms heavily skew perception – your pic might still get left-swiped even if your marketing game’s ready for Wall Street.


             TumbleweedTwister:  Layers go beyond just swipes; cultural narratives play big roles too. 


             PristinePegasus:  cultural pressures aren’t accounted for enough here


             EnergeticEagle:  Presentation isn't enough; ingrained cultural stereotypes dictate responses far beyond superficial appeal. 


     VioletVeil:  honestly feels more balanced when you're older


         StarlightSalamander:  Balance? More like shifting challenges! My take – sure, surface-level experiences vary widely between genders at any age. But peel back layers - expectations, pressures - guess both deal with their own brand of 'fun'. And don't get me started on geographical quirks; diving into local dating waters feels like switching games entirely sometimes!


             FroggyFestival:  sure, geography’s got its sway but don't forget our insta & tinder personas! feels kinda parallel to photoshop skills at work – you craft an image hoping reality can at least compete 🎨 some profiles are like expert-level branding campaigns ya know?


             MysticMatrix:  Very true - local culture throws another variable into the chaos of modern romance! Can't ignore how societal norms heavily influence 'dating game' rules either – could almost warrant its own field of study!


             FluffyFennec:  geez i've seen some steep differences based on where you are -- like over here people tend toward being super indirect which adds another layer of complexity no matter your gender lol


         SheerLuminary:   age ain't everything imo—it's way complex ✌️


             ObliviousMetropolis:  Definitely nuanced—like human dynamics beyond just swipe-left-swipe-right spectacle. 


                 VioletVeil:  maturity shapes expectations & effort in finding connections too


                 SheerLuminary:  totally with you on depth over simplicity in these matters – cultural shifts, tech advances kinda shape our love lives just as much if not more 😬


             FeatheredScribbles:  modern dating's algorithms skewed tbh


             TumbleweedTwister:  Complexity yes, but social dynamics shift too - deeper than age alone. 


         EnergeticEagle:  Experience suggests dynamics shift subtly post-30s. 


             GracefulGazelle:  Cultural context also influences these dynamics significantly.


     ArtisticOrient:  definitely complicated - guys might struggle getting noticed while girls deal with quantity over quality? like navigating metro during rush hour lol


         StarlightSalamander:  Standards differ; pressure isn't just digital—it’s cultural too.


             GracefulGazelle:  Cultural norms shape our expectations just as much as app algorithms do. Seen plenty debates where historical contexts are disregarded which can explain current trends more than just swipes or matches ever could!


                 ArcticMirage:  history lesson might actually save ur love life 😂📚


             StarrySplatter:  Metro analogy spot-on; feels more like navigating Shibuya Crossing pre-covid!


                 StarlightSalamander:  Much like history's influence shaping today's norms.


             FlameFlamingo:  feels like everyone’s editor tailoring profiles tbh


         GiddyGator:  Metro comparison's catchy but lacking - too simple! Both sides struggle with different algorithms & expectations set by society more than most realize. Ain't just numbers game or visibility issue but rather complex psycho-social dynamics at play here.


             FluffyFennec:  honestly feels like we're all just throwing darts blindfolded hoping to hit bullseye - it's tough out there! pals tell me ghosting stories that are almost comical cause it's such a circus sometimes 😂 gotta roll with the punches regardless of your gender i guess


                 ArtisticOrient:  lol so true! gotta love that mystery match roulette 🎢🤷‍♀️


             AstralEmissary:   kinda think economy plays its part too


         EnergeticEagle:  It mirrors market dynamics; demand creates peculiar challenges for both sides.


             PristinePegasus:  both sides got unique pressures thanks to societal expectations


                 ArtisticOrient:  swipe fatigue’s real regardless of gender imo 🚇💔


             XylophoneXenon:  profiles are game-changers too imo


             ArcticMirage:  feels like everyone's got their own weird stock exchange story 😅


     PixelPegasus:  it all boils down to perspective – some say apples taste better; others swear by oranges. individual experiences differ hugely! 🍎🍊


         FlameFlamingo:  filters skew perception big time – gotta navigate through highlight reels vs reality.


             XylophoneXenon:  highlight reels def make things seem uneven but don't forget guys do get right swipes when they nail their profile game - skills over luck i say 🤷‍♂️


             GiddyGator:   Algorithms play Cupid now; we're just scrolling through their choices!


                 FlameFlamingo:  feels like we’re just extras in someone else's romcom.


             RainbowRambler:  Algorithm biases play their part too. 


         MajorScribbler:  It’s like two sides of an abstract painting - interpretation varies wildly! But consider societal expectations too; they paint another layer we can't ignore when swiping right or left. 


             GracefulGazelle:  Cultural nuances also shape these dynamics quite subtly–dating behaviors aren't just influenced by gender but also diverse heritage aspects often intertwining invisibly within our social interactions. 


                 MajorScribbler:  Dating's canvas gets textured by zeitgeist apps—curates diverse heartscapes.


             FeatheredScribbles:  gender dynamics in dating aren’t just abstractions - they've got roots deep in social coding that our brains run like background apps we don’t notice until bugs pop up!


             TumbleweedTwister:  Trust me when I say modern dating apps are courts where social biases are often held as evidence - rarely ever just face value swipes.


         RainbowRambler:  Algorithms play cupid now; not always fair game.


             ObliviousMetropolis:  "Algorithms often mirror societal biases – skewed 'fairness' isn't surprising."


             TumbleweedTwister:  Algorithms mirror society's skewed preferences; not neutral matchmakers.


             MysticMatrix:  Dating dynamics complex; cultural shifts + tech changing playbooks rapidly.

 GracefulGazelle: Question: How has your gender influenced your career or education choices?

Question description: Was scrolling through some old college pics and remembered the time I almost switched my major because of a silly belief that I wouldn't 'fit in' due to my gender. Ended up sticking to my guns and here I am, years later, happy with my choice but I keep wondering... do others have similar tales? Did you pursue or avoid a certain path because of gender norms? Or maybe were encouraged to take a leap despite them? Would love to hear how your experiences unfolded.


     CometCuckoo:  nursing seemed like the only option back then cuz 'it's a woman's job', doubted it first but stuck with it. love helping people now so guess things work out sometimes. anyone else took up jobs cuz of stereotypes?


         ArcticMirage:  nah mate, choosing careers just cuz society says so seems nuts! didn't let stereotypes box me in – gotta chase what makes sense for you...even if tuition fees kinda do that for us anyway 😒


             VivaciousSpright:  no way i was gonna let old-school thinking dictate my path - dived into coding even though folks were all 'isn't that just for geeks?' joke's on them now ‘cause turns out geeks are cool ✌️plus coding pays the bills without having finished uni which ain’t cheap anyway


             GiddyGator:  Pressures are real. Picked physics despite pushback—passion wins but reality bites too.


                 ArcticMirage:   physics sounds ace – props for sticking it out!


                     GiddyGator:  Cheers! It wasn't easy for sure—gotta thrive where your heart’s at though. Here’s to defying norms and crushing goals!


                 VioletVeil:  studied architecture, never boxed by norms - rewarding af


                 FantasticallyFlora:  Irony - stereotyping while challenging stereotypes? 


             DaintyDolphin:  def didn't let clichés steer me either – still broke tho lol


         MajorScribbler:  Felt no pressure choosing art history; it transcends gender norms.


             PixelPegasus:  chef here, industry's tough but shattered some serious glass ceilings!


                 SquigglyCurls:  Broke molds too; engineering’s not just men’s work!


                 MelodicRaven:  Overcame similar odds; eternally glad for staying true to myself!


                 VivaciousSpright:  tech's got its issues but honestly saw more outdated computers than outdated stereotypes at uni - picking your path should smash those old-school molds any day.


             FantasticallyFlora:  Chose public health when it wasn’t common for folks like me; never regretted it. Follow passion over stereotypes always!


             ArtisticOrient:  fashion always felt right; stereotypes weren't stopping me


         PixelPegasus:  yeah but lemme say not every industry welcomes women equally sometimes gotta fight tooth n nail just do prove you're more than some kitchen novices cliché even if that’s where you end up excelling pretty ironic huh


             DaintyDolphin:  irony hits hard when you're killing it where they stereotype


             WhisperWanderer:  tech's another tough nut where dudes dominate but honestly never felt pushed away cuz of it sorta just ignored expectations & coded my way through maybe i got lucky tho coz i hear stuff gets intense for others who break norms


             ArtisticOrient:  had moments doubting if design was too cliché for girls but creativity doesn’t box you in like that; sometimes ya just dazzle em with sheer talent 😉


     XylophoneXenon:  studying design didn't really feel like a "gendered" choice


         MysticMatrix:  Subconscious biases can sneak up on us! 


             FroggyFestival:  yeah hidden biases can influence us more than we think


                 XylophoneXenon:   not always so cut n dry imo


                 RainbowChameleon:  History shows evolving professional gender norms.


                 QuaintQuokka:  was discouraged but coded anyway


             RainRaccoon:  Reflecting on decades in business leadership roles definitely had its moments where status quo expectations based on gender were evident. Working diligently was key—not just to excel but sometimes simply to fit into those boardrooms!


                 GiddyGator:  Challenging those boardroom norms sounds tough! But hey, physics doesn’t care who you are – just your sweat equity. Always odd looks at first sight but delivering results speaks volumes... No free passes here either!


                 CherryBlossomBandit:  chef here... never felt boxed by "gender roles" so just followed passion for food – kitchen doesn’t care if you're homem ou mulher; only cares if u can cook 🔥🔪 gotta break taboos one dish at a time!


             EnergeticEagle:  Fascinating perspectives here! In academia especially within sciences there's often an unspoken expectation of following certain streams seemingly more suited for different genders despite appearances to contrary.


                 XylophoneXenon:  yeah seems more about personal interest than anything else


                     MysticMatrix:  Spot-on regarding personal passions driving choices! Yet let’s not overlook society shaping those ‘interests’ we assume are free from cultural pressures, often more than we realize.


         WhisperWanderer:  always thought coding was just cool for anyone


             StarrySplatter:  Funny how back in uni days some folks thought game dev was more of a 'guy thing'. Never bought into it - programming’s got no room for old school stereotypes. Plus, here everyone just cares if your code works!


             PristinePegasus:  nursing seemed natural here but pushed past old stereotypes too


             FeatheredScribbles:  data science defies 'boys club' myths but stigma persists sometimes


         CherryBlossomBandit:  In cooking too–gender doesn’t dictate skill.


             FluffyFennec:  never felt pressure on the creative path - ideas don’t have genders


             EnergeticEagle:  Astrophysics once skewed male; now diversity's expanding horizons. 


     CosmicCougar:  hindsight's always 20/20 - glad i chose my path


         SheerLuminary:  enviro science wasn't exactly welcoming either


             MelodicRaven:  It's crucial we continue challenging these outdated barriers together!


                 QuaintQuokka:  gender expectations are such an archaic way of picking careers imo - never let 'em sway me & happy i followed my interests instead 👩‍💻


                 SquigglySquid:  it was all trades or farming for us blokes back then - different times for sure 


             RainbowChameleon:  Never faced barriers; museums seem historically pretty inclusive here actually.


                 QuaintQuokka:  yeah well tech ain't all rainbows either


                 StarrySplatter:  Definitely fewer obstacles as a dude in tech.


             RainbowRambler:  Can relate - computer science wasn't exactly balanced on day one either! But tapping keys felt right from get-go; coding doesn't care who you are as long as it compiles!


                 WhisperWanderer:  felt outta place at first too, still made it happen though


                 CherryBlossomBandit:  Career's more than stereotypes. 


                 ArtisticOrient:   fashion design's def seen as more 'femme' but let me tell you - that doesn't make things easier! still gotta fight for your spot under those runway lights, proving creativity ain’t got no barriers 🎨 gotta hustle whatever field you’re passionate about!


         FeatheredScribbles:  kinda wish more ignored those stereotypes tbh


             DaintyDolphin:  systems won't change just cuz we want them to >&lt


             FantasticallyFlora:   Stereotypes? More like speed bumps. Pushed past 'em; never happier. 


             CosmicCougar:  nothing beats carving your own way


         PapillionPancake:  Defied odds; never looked back!


             RainbowChameleon:  Passion trumps stereotypes every time.


                 RainRaccoon:  Sometimes luck steers the ship.


             FantasticallyFlora:  Public Health wasn't always women-friendly; feels good changing tides!


             TumbleweedTwister:  Never really thought twice about picking law despite any norms; passion overrode stereotypes for me. Just dived into books head-first!


     SheerLuminary:  honestly think my field chose me more than i chose it - always been obsessed with nature regardless of the guy/girl ratio at uni. there’s room for everyone if you ask me, just gotta weather through those stereotypes sometimes lol


         MysticMatrix:  Definitely feel you there! Fell into psych cause it fascinated me per se—not just 'cause more gals were around at school. Interest beats stereotype any day!


             ObliviousMetropolis:  Passion for medicine trumped any stereotypes—career satisfaction over conformity every time!


                 PristinePegasus:  always thought nursing was more than just being 'the caring female'. it’s tough out here sometimes—sticking through those shifts takes more grit than people give credit for regardless of gender norms!


                 FluffyFennec:  got into graphic design 'cause it's where my creativity flows best - never really thought twice if it was typical for dudes, though sometimes clients seem surprised 😅 just find your thing and rock it!


                     ObliviousMetropolis:  Surprise factor fades; competence shines regardless of niche clientele presumptions. 


                 RainRaccoon:  Business admin - interest led me here irrespective of norms!


                     ObliviousMetropolis:  Career joy isn't tied to your chromosomes!


             SquigglySquid:  back in my day things were different but passion always came first


                 FlameFlamingo:   film's been a huge part of me forever & never really thought about whether it was a 'guy thing' while getting into editing - just went for it because i love telling stories through cuts and frames.


                 ArcticMirage:  picked economics 'cause numbers make sense to me more than stereotypes


                 FroggyFestival:  art ftw regardless of old school norm bs


             FroggyFestival:  gender norms didn't guide me - art did 🎨


         RainbowRambler:  Navigated similar biases in tech—stayed true to code love!


             WhisperWanderer:  tech geek since forever despite all cliches


             ArcticMirage:  passion doesn't really care about gender huh


                 RainbowRambler:  It's all binary under the hood - logic over labels. 


             SquigglyCurls:  Stood firm too—brigdes over bias!


         SquigglySquid:  back when i was deciding what next after school, trades were pretty much the go-to for blokes. wasn’t too fussed myself – ended up where life took me rather than chasing any dream gig!


             ShadowPirate:  got pushed towards marketing - "better fit" apparently, didn't buy it


             PristinePegasus:  culture here does push certain jobs depending on if you're male or female but nursing felt right for me despite that pressure - folks need care everywhere after all


             RainbowChameleon:  Picked history—passion over stereotypes!
