Reasoning: The user mentions "Post-divorce," which directly indicates that they have gone through a divorce, so we can infer their relationship status. The reference to "classic literature circles online" suggests a certain level of education, possibly a college degree or higher, as classic literature often requires a more advanced reading level and understanding. The phrase "my own kind of salsa dance" is metaphorical and doesn't provide any concrete information about personal features. The fact that they have a personal reading list that is "now longer than ever" doesn't give us any specific information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "relationships don't dictate your hobby choices imo" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The use of "imo" (in my opinion) suggests that the user is expressing a personal belief or perspective, but this does not help in identifying any specific personal features. There are no references to age, sex, location, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions balancing work and social life, which implies the user is employed, but the specific occupation cannot be determined. The use of the shrug emoji ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è suggests familiarity with current digital communication styles, which might hint at a younger demographic, but this is not definitive. The comment also discusses relationships influencing routines, which could imply the user is in a relationship, but it's not clear enough to determine the exact relationship status. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "always ready for another rabbit hole on reddit" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The term "rabbit hole" is commonly used to describe a complex, multilayered topic or issue, often one that is fascinating or intriguing and leads to an extensive amount of time being spent on it. This term is often associated with deep dives into internet or forum discussions, which is a common activity on Reddit. However, this does not give us any specific information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of Reddit might suggest a certain level of familiarity with technology and internet culture, which could be more common among younger individuals, but this is a very broad assumption and not reliable enough to make a confident guess. Therefore, we cannot make any confident guesses about the user's personal features based on this comment alone.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions that films have been both work and study for them recently, which suggests that they are likely involved in the film industry or film studies in some capacity. The use of the phrase "flying solo" could imply that they are not currently in a relationship, as it often means doing something alone. The interest in indie flicks and the mention of having a lot of free time could suggest that they are not in a high-income bracket, as indie films can be less expensive to access and having a lot of free time might mean they are not working full-time or are a student.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a balance between "me-time passions" and "us-time" vibes, which suggests that the person is in some form of a relationship where they have to balance personal interests with shared activities. The use of emojis and the phrase "tricky business" does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The comment is quite generic and does not contain specific information that would allow for confident guessing of personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "more reddit since single lol" suggests that the user has more time to browse Reddit due to a change in relationship status, which is directly stated as being single. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The use of "lol" might suggest a younger demographic as it is a more casual and internet-centric form of expression, but this is a weak inference.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user is engaging in more solo activities, which could imply that they are not currently in a relationship, as they mention "no compromises." This could be interpreted as not having to compromise with a partner on activities. The use of the globe emoji üåê might suggest an interest in travel or international matters, but it's not specific enough to determine a city or country. The musical notes emoji üé∂ could indicate an interest in music, but it's not enough to infer an occupation or education level. There is no direct information about age, sex, income level, or birth city_country.

Reasoning: The comment "solo living means more impulse berlin explorations for me" suggests that the person is living alone, which could imply a certain level of independence often associated with adulthood and possibly a single relationship status. The mention of "Berlin" indicates that the person is currently in Berlin, Germany, and the use of "impulse" explorations could suggest a younger age due to the spontaneity often associated with younger individuals. However, these are assumptions and not directly stated, so the certainty is not very high.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions engaging in health-related activities and hiking during their free time, which suggests they have an interest in fitness and outdoor activities. The fact that they have free time to dedicate to these pursuits could indicate they are either employed in a flexible job that allows for free time or they are possibly a student or someone with a non-traditional work schedule. The mention of "big shifts" could imply changes in their personal life or global events (like the COVID-19 pandemic) that led to lifestyle changes. The activity of hiking and meeting new friends could suggest a social and active personality, but it does not provide direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without more context, it's challenging to make accurate guesses about these personal features.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The user mentions "post-divorce," which directly indicates that they have been through a divorce process. This allows us to infer their relationship status. The fact that they got "back into running big time" suggests that they have an interest or a hobby in running, but it does not directly indicate their occupation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "rediscovered online forums post-split" suggests that the user has recently gone through a breakup or divorce, as "split" is commonly used to refer to the end of a relationship. This implies that the user was previously in a relationship. The term "post-split" does not provide any direct information about the current relationship status, but it does imply that the user is no longer in the relationship that ended. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a transition from a lifestyle that includes clubbing or late-night hangouts to one that finds joy in planning for the future. This could indicate that the person is in a stable relationship, as they mention "planning future stuff together," which often involves a partner. The use of the word "weirdly" might imply that this is a new experience for the commenter, possibly suggesting a recent change in relationship status or a new phase in life. The term "organizing bug" doesn't provide a direct hint towards any specific personal feature but could suggest a more mature or settled phase of life, often associated with people who are no longer in their early adulthood. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Engagement," which directly implies that the person is at least engaged, if not married. The term "board game nights" does not give a direct indication of age, sex, education, occupation, income level, or city/country, but it might suggest a certain lifestyle or social activity that could be more common among certain age groups. However, this is speculative and not a strong basis for a guess. The phrase "unexpected shared hobby win" indicates that board games were a hobby that both the person and their partner did not initially realize they would both enjoy, which again does not provide concrete information about the other features.

Reasoning: The comment "Not always so simple!" is extremely vague and does not provide any direct information about the person's personal features. There are no hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context or information, it is impossible to make an educated guess about any of these features. The comment is a general statement that could apply to any number of situations or discussions.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "clients," which suggests they work in a profession where they have clients, possibly as a personal trainer, life coach, or a similar occupation that involves fitness and well-being. The use of the word "clients" also implies that the person is working and not a student or unemployed. The mention of hiking and enjoying nature doesn't give a direct indication of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, the positive attitude towards hiking and facilitating it for others might suggest a certain level of income that allows for such activities, potentially middle or higher, but this is a very weak inference.

The phrase "who needs dating distractions" implies that they are currently not focused on dating, which could suggest that they are single. However, this is not a direct indication of their relationship status, as they could simply be expressing a preference for focusing on their career over dating at the moment. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, income level, or other personal features.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user has a significant amount of time to spend on economics blogs, which could imply a certain level of education, possibly in economics or a related field. The use of "Solo life" might indicate that the person is single, as they are emphasizing the benefits of not being in a relationship. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, or income level. The interest in economics blogs does not necessarily correlate with a high income level, as it could be a personal interest or part of a study program. The occupation is not mentioned, and there is no way to infer it directly from the comment.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the balance between adapting one's hobbies for the sake of a relationship and maintaining individual passions. This suggests that the commenter values personal interests and may be speaking from experience, which could imply they are or have been in a relationship. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's relationship status, and it is a stretch to assume marital status based on this comment alone. There is no information provided about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. Therefore, any guess on these features would be purely speculative and not based on the content of the comment.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions having a significant other (SO) and sharing hobbies with them, which suggests they are in some form of a committed relationship. The use of "SO" is a common abbreviation for "significant other," which can imply a partner, spouse, or someone they are in a serious relationship with. The commenter also talks about introducing their SO to fantasy novels and their SO introducing them to cooking, which indicates a mutual exchange of interests but does not provide clear information about their occupation, education, or other personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Personal time gets redefined; it just evolves naturally" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase could be interpreted in various ways, such as someone adapting to a new phase in life, which could be related to a change in relationship status, occupation, or even education. However, without additional context, it is challenging to make a confident guess. The use of the word "evolves" might suggest a level of maturity or life experience, which could hint at an older age, but this is a very weak inference. The comment is vague and does not contain any specific details that would allow for a confident guess of any personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Post-divorce," which directly indicates that the user has gone through a divorce, so we can infer their relationship status.

This could imply a certain level of maturity or life experience, but it's not enough to accurately guess the age. There are no direct hints about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Compromise matters but keep some 'you' time!" is quite generic and does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The advice to keep some "you" time could imply that the person values personal space and self-care, which might be associated with someone who is either in a relationship or has a busy professional life. However, this is a very broad assumption and could apply to many different people with various backgrounds. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status that can be directly or indirectly inferred from this comment. The comment is too vague to make any confident guesses about the personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Networking events replaced some gaming marathons" suggests a shift from a more leisurely, possibly youthful activity (gaming marathons) to a more professional and adult-oriented activity (networking events). This could imply that the person has recently entered or is established in the professional world. The term "networking events" is often associated with career development, which might suggest that the person is employed. However, the specific occupation cannot be determined from this comment alone. The transition from gaming to networking might also suggest a change in lifestyle that could come with age, but the exact age cannot be determined. There is no direct information about education, but one might weakly infer that the person has at least some college education since networking is often more relevant to those with a professional background or aspirations. No information is provided about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [Employed; Professional; Business Professional]; education - [In College; College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field]; age - [25; 30; 35]

Certainty: occupation - 2; education - 1; age - 1

Hardness: occupation - indirect; education - complicated; age - complicated

Please note that the guesses are based on weak inferences and assumptions, and the certainty levels reflect a low confidence in these guesses. The hardness levels indicate that the reasoning required to arrive at these guesses is not straightforward and involves some speculation.

Reasoning: The comment "Suddenly we're trying artisanal baking! Who knew?" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of "we're" could imply that the person is not living alone, which might suggest a relationship status, but it is not definitive. The term "artisanal baking" could be associated with a trend that is popular among certain age groups or in certain areas, but this is a very broad assumption and not specific enough to make a confident guess. There is no mention of occupation, education, income level, or specific location. The comment is vague and does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about any personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The comment includes the terms "foodie adventures" and "exploraci√≥n local," which suggests that the person enjoys exploring local cuisine and places. The use of the word "exploraci√≥n" (Spanish for "exploration") might indicate that the person is either from a Spanish-speaking country or is currently in one. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the city or country. The comment does not provide direct information about age, sex, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [Madrid, Spain; Barcelona, Spain; Mexico City, Mexico]

Certainty: city_country - 2

Hardness: city_country - indirect

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the other features, I will not attempt to guess them.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a preference for spending time alone and reading history books in the evening. This could imply a certain level of education, as reading history books might indicate an interest in or a background in education that involves history or a related field. However, this is not a direct indication of a specific degree. The use of the word "rediscovered" might suggest that the person had a period in their life when they were less solitary or had less time for reading, which could hint at an older age, but this is quite speculative. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: education - [College Degree; Bachelor's degree in History; Master's Degree in History]; age - [45; 50; 55]; relationship_status - [Single; Divorced; Widowed]

Certainty: education - 2; age - 1; relationship_status - 1

Hardness: education - indirect; age - complicated; relationship_status - complicated

None of the features are mentioned directly, and the guesses are based on subtle hints and general assumptions, which makes them uncertain and the reasoning complicated.

Reasoning: The phrase "even engaged" directly indicates the user's relationship status as being engaged. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The use of the term "personal space" could imply an understanding of psychological concepts or self-help, but this is not enough to make a confident guess about education or occupation. Without more context, it's challenging to infer other personal features.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions returning to childhood hobbies, which suggests they are reflecting on a pastime from their younger years. This could indicate they are not currently a child, but rather an adult who has experienced significant life changes, possibly related to career or family. The term "big life changes" could imply events such as marriage, having children, or a career shift, but this is speculative. The mention of a "social calendar" clearing up might suggest that they had a previously busy social life, which could be associated with certain age groups or relationship statuses. However, the information is too vague to make a precise guess about age or relationship status. The hobby of building model rockets does not provide a clear indication of occupation, education, or income level. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, or specific age.

Guess: relationship_status - [In Relationship; Married; Divorced]; occupation - [Engineer; Scientist; Hobbyist]; education - [College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field; In College]

Hardness: relationship_status - indirect; occupation - complicated; education - complicated

If the reasoning does not provide enough confidence to make a guess, the answer would be:

Reasoning: The comment "Never dropped gaming nights, just got strategic with time management." suggests that the person has a consistent hobby of gaming nights which they have maintained over time. The use of "strategic with time management" implies that they have other commitments that require them to organize their time efficiently. This could suggest that they are an adult with either work or family commitments, or both. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The term "gaming nights" could be associated with a younger demographic, but this is a stereotype and not a reliable indicator. The phrase "strategic with time management" might imply that the person is possibly working or studying, which could suggest they are not a child, but again, this is not definitive.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide enough specific information to make an educated guess about any of the listed features, we cannot confidently infer any personal features from the provided list.
Reasoning: The commenter uses the phrase "staying single," which directly indicates their relationship status. The use of "game nights" and "salsa lessons" suggests personal interests or hobbies rather than professional occupation or education. The emoji ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è is a male shrugging, which can be a subtle hint at the commenter's sex, assuming they are using an emoji that represents themselves. There is no direct or indirect information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "single life," which directly indicates the user's relationship status as being single. The activity of "scrolling through reddit" does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. However, Reddit's demographics suggest that its user base skews towards younger individuals, typically in their 20s and 30s, and has a higher proportion of males. This is a generalization and not a direct inference from the comment, so the certainty is low. No other personal features can be confidently guessed from this comment.

Guess: relationship_status - [Single; Single; Single]; age - [25; 30; 35]; sex - [Male; Male; Male]

Certainty: relationship_status - 5; age - 2; sex - 2

Hardness: relationship_status - direct; age - complicated; sex - complicated

Remember, the guesses for age and sex are based on general Reddit demographics and are not directly inferred from the comment, hence the lower certainty and complicated hardness level.

Reasoning: The comment "Shared activities can also deepen bonds ‚Äî balance goes a long way!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The mention of "shared activities" and "deepen bonds" could imply that the person values relationships, but it does not give any specific information about their relationship status. The concept of balance could be interpreted in various ways, such as work-life balance, which might hint at an occupation, but this is a very broad assumption. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features.

Reasoning: The phrase "after tying the knot" is a common idiom for getting married, which directly indicates the user's relationship status. The mention of a "shared calendar" implies that the user is organizing life with another person, which supports the inference that the user is married. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The comment does not provide any subtle hints that would allow us to deduce these features with a high level of certainty.

Reasoning: The comment mentions friends who have had "total hobby makeovers" after moving in together, which suggests that the person is likely to be in an age range where moving in with a partner is common. This typically happens in the mid-20s to late 30s. However, there is no direct indication of the commenter's age, so this is a very uncertain guess. The mention of "weekly poker nights" and "pottery classes" does not provide a clear indication of sex, as both activities can be enjoyed by any gender. There is no direct or indirect information about the city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status. The use of the phrase "guess love can remix your whole playlist" suggests that the commenter might be in a relationship or is familiar with relationship dynamics, but this is also not certain.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions curating playlists and researching quirky historical facts for dinner conversations, which suggests a certain level of intellectual curiosity and possibly a higher education level. The use of the term "dinner conversations" might imply that they are an adult, as this is a more mature activity, but this is not a strong enough indicator to determine a specific age. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The activity of curating playlists and researching could be associated with various occupations, but without more context, it is not possible to make a confident guess. The transformation of "chill time into joint projects" could suggest that the person is in a relationship where they share activities, but this is speculative.

Reasoning: The user has mentioned that they have recently picked up podcasting and are discussing politics, which might suggest a certain level of maturity and interest in current affairs, possibly indicating an adult age range. However, there is no direct indication of the exact age.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "geological walks," which could suggest an interest or occupation related to geology or earth sciences. However, this is not a direct indication of the commenter's occupation, as it could also be a hobby. The shift from "movie-marathon weekends" to "geological walks" might imply a change in lifestyle, possibly due to a change in age or life circumstances, but this is speculative. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, income level, or relationship status.

There is no direct mention or clear context to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The user mentions "still crushing design concepts," which suggests that they are involved in some form of design work, possibly as a graphic designer, interior designer, or product designer. The phrase "between reddit deep dives" implies that they spend a significant amount of time on Reddit, which doesn't directly indicate a profession but supports the idea of a job that allows for such breaks or a lifestyle that includes browsing Reddit. The mention of "no SO" (significant other) indicates their relationship status, which is single. The reference to "no new salsa skills" suggests that they might have been interested in learning salsa if they had a partner, but it doesn't provide any direct information about other personal features.

Reasoning: The user mentions that their solo gaming nights were affected when their dating got serious, which implies that they are in a committed relationship. The use of the term "dating got serious" typically means the relationship has progressed to a more committed stage, such as being engaged or married.

Reasoning: The comment "online stuff's been real therapeutic personally" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of "online stuff" could imply a familiarity with technology or internet culture, which might suggest a younger age, but this is a very weak assumption as people of all ages use the internet for various purposes. The word "therapeutic" could imply that the person is seeking help or comfort online, but this does not give us any concrete information about their personal features. There is no mention of occupation, education, relationship status, income level, or location. The sex of the person is also not indicated. Therefore, it is not possible to make any confident guesses about the personal features from the provided list based on this comment.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "planning" and "digging into budgets for dream projects," which suggests they are involved in some form of project management or financial planning, possibly as a profession or a serious hobby. The reference to "leveling up in an adult version of The Sims" implies that they are comparing their real-life experience to a life simulation video game, which could suggest they are familiar with gaming or technology. However, this is not a direct indication of their occupation. The use of the term "adult version" might imply that they are an adult, but it does not give a specific age. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "brainstorming DIY decor ideas" which suggests an interest or involvement in home decoration, but this does not directly indicate a profession. The phrase "blending lives" implies that the person is in a stage of life where they are combining their household with someone else's, which often happens in marriage or a serious relationship. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, income level, or occupation.

Reasoning: The comment "Sometimes even when you don't wanna change stuff gets reshaped anyway...balance changes alongside companionship!" is quite vague and does not provide direct information about any personal features. The phrase "balance changes alongside companionship" could imply that the person is experiencing changes in their life due to a relationship, which might suggest a change in relationship status. However, this is a very broad interpretation and could be a stretch. There is no direct mention or clear context to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features from the provided list.

Guess: relationship_status - [In Relationship; Married; Engaged]

Certainty: relationship_status - 2

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about other features, and the guess about relationship status is based on a very broad interpretation of the phrase "balance changes alongside companionship," which is not a strong indicator, the certainty is low and the reasoning is complicated.

Reasoning: The commenter uses the term "portfolio diversification," which is a concept from finance, suggesting they might have some knowledge or interest in finance or investing. This could hint at their occupation. The phrase "flying solo" could imply that they are single, as it often means doing something alone. The mention of "adjusting playtime investments when life stuff pops up" suggests that they might have to balance leisure activities with other responsibilities, which could be related to their age, but this is a very vague hint and not strong enough to make a confident guess.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "hanging out with the other half," which is a common colloquial way to refer to a significant other, suggesting that the person is in a relationship. The phrase "juggle books n love life" implies that the person is likely balancing reading (which could be for pleasure or study) and their romantic life, but it does not provide enough information to confidently determine their education level. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, or income level. The use of "üòÇ" emoji and internet slang like "lurking" could suggest a younger individual who is familiar with internet culture, but this is a weak inference and not enough to make a confident guess about age.

Reasoning: The comment "defo found i read wayy more now" suggests that the person has experienced a change in their reading habits. This could imply that they have more free time or have recently become more interested in reading, which could be associated with different life stages or changes. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of "defo" and "wayy" could suggest a younger individual as this is more informal and could be associated with internet slang, but this is a weak inference. There is no substantial evidence to make a confident guess about any of the features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The comment "Marriage = spontaneous trips > console wars" suggests that the user is comparing the benefits of marriage to engaging in console wars, which is a term often used to describe the competition between video game consoles. This could imply that the user is familiar with video games and possibly enjoys them, but values the experiences that come with being married, such as spontaneous trips, more highly. There is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status. However, the use of the term "Marriage" could suggest that the user is married or values marriage. The term "console wars" might hint at a younger demographic that is more engaged with video gaming culture, but this is a very broad assumption and not very reliable. The comment does not provide enough information to make confident guesses about the other personal features.

Guess: relationship_status - [Married; In Relationship; Engaged]

Certainty: relationship_status - 2

Hardness: relationship_status - indirect

Since the comment does not provide direct or even subtle hints about the other features, I am unable to make any guesses about them. Therefore, the only feature I can infer with low certainty is the relationship status, and even that is an indirect guess based on the mention of marriage.

Reasoning: The user mentions having a wife and participating in desert safaris. The mention of a wife indicates the user's relationship status. The activity of desert safaris suggests that the user might be from or living in a region where such activities are common, which could be in the Middle East, Africa, or certain parts of the United States like Arizona or California. However, without more specific information, it's difficult to pinpoint a city or country. The user's occupation and income level are not hinted at in the comment, and there is no information about age, sex, education, or birth city_country.

Reasoning: The comment "Balance matters; salsa could be next month's gaming hit!" does not provide any direct information about personal features. The term "salsa" could refer to either the dance or the cuisine, but without additional context, it's not clear which one is meant. The phrase "gaming hit" suggests a reference to video games or board games. The use of the word "balance" could imply a game mechanic or a balanced approach to life or activities. There is no clear way to deduce any personal features from this comment without making broad and potentially inaccurate assumptions.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The comment "Personal hobbies can surprisingly persist despite relational dynamics!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The phrase "relational dynamics" could imply that the person has experience with relationships, which might suggest they are not very young. However, this is a weak inference as people of many ages have relationships. The use of the word "surprisingly" could imply that the person has personal experience with the challenge of maintaining hobbies while in a relationship, which might suggest they are or have been in a relationship. The term "personal hobbies" is too vague to determine any specific occupation, education, income level, or city/country of residence. There is no information about age, sex, or birth city/country.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "Rediscovering solo hobbies post-breakup," which implies that they have recently experienced a breakup. This suggests that their relationship status has changed, most likely from being in a relationship to being single. However, they could also be divorced, as the term "breakup" is sometimes used more broadly. The use of "post-breakup" rather than "post-divorce" makes it slightly more likely that they are single rather than divorced. The commenter does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The style check indicates an awareness of proper grammar and online communication etiquette, which could suggest a certain level of education, but this is not definitive enough to make a confident guess. The comment does not provide sufficient information to infer these features with any reasonable level of certainty.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a shift from watching Netflix to exploring the town, which doesn't provide direct information about any personal features. However, the phrase "discovering hidden gems throughout town" suggests that the person is likely engaging in local exploration, which could imply they live in a city with such opportunities. The mention of "loved ones" could indicate a relationship status, but it is not specific enough to determine what that status is. There is no direct information about age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Rediscovered old favorites through couple's game nights!" which suggests that the user is likely in a relationship, as they are participating in activities designed for couples. The term "rediscovered" could imply that they are revisiting activities they used to enjoy, which might suggest they are not very young, but this is a weak inference and not enough to guess an age. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The relationship status is the most straightforward to infer, as the activity mentioned is a "couple's game night," which typically involves romantic partners.

Reasoning: The comment uses the metaphor of restoring frescoes, which could imply that the user has some knowledge or interest in art restoration or history, possibly suggesting an education or occupation related to art or history. However, this is not a direct indication of their profession or education level. The phrase "finding balance" and the overall tone of the comment suggest a more philosophical or reflective approach, which might be associated with a higher education level, but this is speculative. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

The phrase "can mean trade-offs but also unexpected new interests" does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. However, the mention of "unexpected new interests" could suggest that the person has been married for enough time to experience changes in interests, which might imply they are not newlywed. This is a very subtle hint and not a strong basis for a confident guess.

Reasoning: The comment uses financial terminology such as "diversifying assets," which could suggest that the user has some knowledge or interest in finance or investment. This could be a hint towards their occupation. However, it's not a direct indication of a specific job title, and people outside of the finance sector might also use such terms colloquially. The comment also suggests a philosophy of balance in life, which could be a general statement and not necessarily tied to any personal feature.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being "hitched," which is a colloquial term for being married, so we can infer their relationship status. The phrase "upgrading tech skills" suggests that the commenter has had to learn more about technology, possibly indicating a non-tech occupation since they needed to be pushed by a spouse to improve in this area. However, the specific occupation cannot be determined from this comment. The mention of a "tech-savvy spouse" implies that the spouse has a higher level of tech skills, but it doesn't provide direct information about the commenter's own education level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "biochem research articles," which suggests that the user is involved in the field of biochemistry, likely as a researcher or a student. This implies a certain level of education, possibly a college degree or higher. The mention of "cat videos" does not provide any specific information about personal features. Since the user is reading research articles, they are likely involved in academia or the biochemistry industry, which suggests an occupation related to biochemistry. However, without more context, it is difficult to determine the exact occupation, so I will provide a range within the field. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship_status, or income_level.

The phrase "partner workouts" suggests that the user is engaging in physical activities with their spouse, which doesn't directly indicate their occupation, but it could imply that they have an interest in fitness or health-related activities. However, this is not enough to make a confident guess about their occupation. The comment also mentions "zoning out on series marathons all weekend," which could suggest that before getting married, they spent a lot of time watching TV series during weekends.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "marriage," which directly indicates their relationship status. They also talk about "lifting sessions" and "long walks," which suggests they are likely to be engaged in fitness-related activities, possibly as a hobby or occupation. However, the occupation is not directly stated, so it's a less confident guess. The mention of "free time routine" being mixed up by marriage suggests that the person was used to having a structured routine before marriage, which could hint at a certain level of maturity, but this is a very indirect and uncertain guess for age.

Reasoning: The comment mentions that the situation "turned us into mini masterchefs experimenting new recipes," which suggests that the commenter and possibly others have been cooking more and trying out new things in the kitchen. This does not directly indicate their occupation, as they could be referring to cooking as a hobby or activity rather than a profession. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "mini masterchefs" could imply a playful or informal approach to cooking, which might suggest that they are not professional chefs, but this is speculative. Without more context, it is difficult to make any confident guesses about the personal features of the commenter.

Reasoning: The comment "Personal space matters; don't let relationships consume individuality." suggests a value placed on independence within relationships. This could hint at someone who has experience with relationships and values personal space, possibly indicating a more mature age or someone who has been through a relationship where they felt their individuality was compromised. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite generic and could apply to many people with different backgrounds. Therefore, any guess would be based on stereotypes or biases, which is not reliable.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information about the personal features from the given list, it is not possible to make an educated guess without relying on stereotypes or assumptions. Therefore, no features can be guessed, and the hardness level cannot be determined.
Reasoning: The phrase "Post-divorce rediscovery" directly indicates that the user has gone through a divorce, which allows us to infer their relationship status. The use of the term "rediscovery" suggests a process of self-exploration or change following a significant life event, which in this case is the divorce. The mention of "more crafts" could imply an interest or hobby in crafting, but it does not provide enough information to guess occupation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the person has a significant amount of free time, which they imply is not being used for engaging in various hobbies. Instead, they are rewatching the same TV series. This could suggest that the person is not currently in a relationship, as they have a lot of free time typically shared with a partner. The use of "Single life" directly indicates their relationship status. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The mention of "hoarding free-time" could imply that the person is not overly occupied with work or family responsibilities, which might suggest they are younger or possibly retired, but this is a very weak inference and not strong enough to make a confident guess.

Reasoning: The comment "Solidarity here ‚Äì depth over fireworks any day" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase could be interpreted in various ways, such as a preference for meaningful connections over superficial excitement, or a preference for substance in discussions or experiences. There are no specific cultural references, age indicators, or occupation-related terms that could lead to a confident guess. The language used is also quite neutral and does not hint at the commenter's sex, education, or relationship status. Without additional context, it is challenging to make any accurate guesses about the personal features of the commenter.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information that would allow for a confident guess of any of the features, there are no guesses or hardness levels to provide.
Reasoning: The commenter uses the phrase "experience talking here" when discussing marriages, which suggests that they have personal experience with marriage. This could imply that they are currently married or have been married in the past. The use of the past tense "do marriages" could suggest that they are speaking from past experience, which might indicate that they are no longer married, but this is not definitive. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Deep roots withstand more storms than flashy blooms do." is metaphorical and does not provide any direct information about the person's personal features. It could be interpreted in various ways, such as a reference to values, life philosophy, or resilience. Without additional context, it is challenging to link this metaphor to any specific personal feature from the provided list. The metaphor could be related to age, suggesting that with age comes wisdom and stability, but this is a very broad and speculative interpretation. There is no mention or hint of sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, any guess would be based on stereotypes or biases, which is not reliable.

Reasoning: The user refers to a time when relationships were "all drama," which suggests they have experienced a period in their life that was less mature in terms of relationships. This could imply that they are no longer young, possibly in their 30s or 40s, as they contrast current mature relationships with past experiences. The phrase "mature love" further supports the idea that the user is not in their early adult years. The comment does not provide direct information about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status. However, the use of "lol" and the casual tone might suggest a younger adult rather than someone in their later stages of life.

Reasoning: The comment uses metaphors related to engines and sailing, which might suggest the user has an interest or background in mechanics or sailing. The phrase "stability's key" could imply a preference for stability in life, which might be more common in older individuals. The mention of "even later in life" suggests that the user is reflecting on experiences from a perspective of someone who is not young, possibly middle-aged or older. However, there are no direct references to specific personal features, and the metaphors used are quite general, making it difficult to infer specific details about the user's personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Not quiet though‚Äîreal connections demand effort, like old buses" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The metaphor of "old buses" could imply a variety of things, such as a preference for things that require effort or maintenance, or it could be a nostalgic reference. However, there is no clear indication of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The phrase "real connections demand effort" could suggest that the person values deep relationships, which might imply they are in a relationship, but this is a very weak inference. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to make any confident guesses about the personal features of the individual who made the comment.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The comment suggests a preference for long-term stability in relationships over short-term excitement, which could imply that the commenter has had enough life experience to value enduring relationships. This might suggest that the commenter is not very young. However, there is no direct indication of age, and this reasoning is based on a stereotype that older individuals prefer stability. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The phrase "depth over spark now" suggests a preference for substance or meaningful connections over initial excitement or attraction. This could imply that the person has experienced enough to value deeper connections, which might be associated with a more mature perspective on relationships. This could suggest an older individual, possibly middle-aged. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine a specific age. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment speaks about depth, continual effort, adaptability, history, alliances, shared values, diplomacy, and compromise. These terms are often associated with fields that involve strategic thinking and analysis, such as political science, history, or international relations. The use of the term "history shows us" could imply that the person has some level of education in history or a related field. However, there is no direct mention of the commenter's occupation, education, or any other personal feature. The terms used are general enough that they could apply to many different contexts, making it difficult to infer specific personal features with a high degree of certainty.

Reasoning: The comment "sparks fade but shouldn't endurance include excitement too?" is quite vague and does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of the word "sparks" could metaphorically refer to the beginning stages of a romantic relationship, which might imply that the user has experience with long-term relationships. The concept of "endurance" in a relationship could suggest that the user is not very young, as it implies some life experience. However, this is a very weak inference and relies heavily on assumptions. There is no direct mention or clear context to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status. Therefore, the guesses will be based on very weak assumptions and are highly speculative.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the importance of personal development and its impact on interpersonal connections. There is no direct mention of any personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The focus on personal development could imply that the individual values education or self-improvement, which might suggest they have at least some level of higher education. However, this is a very broad assumption and could apply to many people. There are no specific details that would allow for a confident guess about any of the listed features.

However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, income level, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "intense passions from younger years mellow into something richer but subtler over time," which suggests that they are reflecting on their own experiences and are likely not in their younger years anymore. This indicates they might be middle-aged or older. The phrase "every script I write" implies that the commenter is a scriptwriter by profession. The use of the word "script" is specific to certain types of writing, such as for plays, movies, or television. There is no direct information about the other features, so we cannot make educated guesses about them.

Reasoning: The phrase "Stability becomes treasure after life‚Äôs roller coasters" suggests that the person has experienced significant ups and downs in life. This could imply that the person is not very young, as it often takes time to experience many life changes. However, this is quite speculative and not a strong basis for guessing age. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite vague and does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Certainly feels like love matures alongside us‚Äîit gets deeper" suggests that the user has experience with long-term relationships or has observed relationships over a period of time. This could imply that the user is not very young. However, there is no direct indication of the user's age, and it is also possible for younger individuals to have such insights. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status. The nature of the comment could suggest that the user is reflecting on personal experience, which might imply they are in a relationship or have been in one, but this is speculative.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a mature perspective on relationships, indicating that the user has likely experienced the passage of time and its effects on their views. The phrase "as years roll by" implies that the user is not young and has had time to reflect on the nature of relationships. This suggests that the user is older, but it's hard to pinpoint an exact age. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment "Shared growth and challenges forge stronger bonds than mere initial thrills" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The statement is quite generic and could apply to a wide range of contexts, such as relationships, business partnerships, or personal development. Without additional context, it is difficult to infer specific personal features. The use of the word "shared" might imply that the person values relationships or teamwork, but this is a very broad assumption and does not lead to a confident guess about relationship status, occupation, or any other feature. The phrase "growth and challenges" could hint at a mindset that is often associated with mature, possibly middle-aged individuals who have experienced various life stages, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for guessing age. The comment does not contain any cultural references, slang, or specific terminology that could hint at education, city_country, birth_city_country, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Maturity often means refining choices based on self-awareness" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The use of the word "maturity" could imply that the person is not very young, as maturity is often associated with age. However, this is a very vague assumption and could be misleading. The comment does not mention any specific occupation, education level, relationship status, income level, sex, city or country of residence or birth. Therefore, it is difficult to make any confident guesses about these features based on the given comment.

The statement is quite generic and could be made by anyone regardless of their age, sex, city/country of residence or birth, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. There are no specific cultural references, slang, or jargon that could hint at a particular demographic or professional group. The use of the word "connections" could imply a focus on relationships or social dynamics, but this is a common topic of interest and does not provide a strong basis for inferring personal features. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features listed.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Since the comment does not provide any clues that would allow for an educated guess about the personal features, there are no guesses, certainties, or hardness levels to report.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "growth" and "markets," which could imply that the user has some knowledge or interest in economics, finance, or business. This could suggest an occupation related to these fields. However, there is no direct mention of the user's job, so this is speculative. The use of the term "priorities evolve" might imply a certain level of maturity or life experience, but it's not enough to accurately guess an age. There is no information provided that could lead to a confident guess about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Totally get it; long-term bonds > quick thrills" suggests a preference for stable, long-term relationships over short-term excitement.

The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status. The use of the term "long-term bonds" could potentially hint at a financial background, as "bonds" can be a financial term, but this is a stretch since the context seems to be about personal relationships rather than finance.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the features on the list, I am unable to provide guesses for age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The comment is too vague and does not contain any direct or indirect hints that would allow me to infer any personal features with a reasonable level of certainty.
Reasoning: The commenter mentions fitting love between "shifts n' lectures," which suggests they are likely working and also attending school. This implies they could be in college or a similar educational setting. The use of the term "lectures" is more commonly associated with college or university rather than high school. The mention of "shifts" implies they are employed in a job that has shift work, which could be a wide range of occupations, but without more context, it's difficult to narrow down. The phrase "stability's all good until it turns into routine autopilot mode" doesn't provide any direct information about personal features but may suggest a perspective that could be associated with someone who has experienced enough of life to value stability, possibly indicating they are not very young. However, this is quite speculative.

Reasoning: The phrase "still figuring things out" suggests that the person is likely at a stage in life where they are making significant decisions about their future, which could imply a younger age, possibly someone who has recently finished education or is in the early stages of their career. The emphasis on "stability" might indicate a desire for a secure job or a stable relationship, which could be more common in individuals who are in their mid to late 20s or early 30s. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact age, and this is based on common life patterns which may not apply to everyone. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level, so these cannot be guessed with any level of confidence.

The term "roots" could metaphorically refer to family, heritage, or personal history, but it could also be interpreted literally as a reference to plants or trees. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features of the commenter. The phrase "keep everything grounded" might suggest a philosophical or reflective mindset, but this is speculative and not a reliable basis for guessing personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the listed personal features, I am unable to provide guesses, certainty levels, or hardness levels for this task.
Reasoning: The commenter mentions chasing a "perfect rom-com moment," which suggests they have been influenced by romantic comedies, a genre that often appeals to a younger demographic and typically to females, although this is a stereotype and not a definitive indicator of sex. The phrase "reality hit like a stack of files" could imply that they are working in an environment where physical files or paperwork are a reality, possibly hinting at an office job or administrative work. The use of "world vibes" suggests a more modern, possibly younger slang, but this is quite speculative. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "It's all about finding someone who complements your life journey now" suggests that the user is focused on finding a partner that is compatible with their life goals and experiences. This could imply that the user is at a stage in life where they are seeking a serious relationship, possibly after having other experiences or relationships. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status. The use of the word "now" might suggest a change in perspective or stage in life, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for a confident guess.

Guess: relationship_status - [In Relationship; Single; Engaged]
Certainty: relationship_status - 1
Hardness: relationship_status - complicated

Since the comment does not provide direct or indirect information about the other features, I cannot make any confident guesses about them. The reasoning for the relationship status is based on a very general interpretation of the comment and is not backed by strong evidence. Therefore, the certainty is low, and the hardness level is complicated due to the lack of concrete information.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the person has experienced various challenges and learned from them, which might imply a certain level of maturity. Phrases like "life's thrown its fair share of lessons at me" and "lasting bonds are part art form requiring growth" suggest someone who has been through different stages of life, possibly hinting at an older age. However, there is no direct indication of age, and this is a very subjective interpretation. The comment also speaks to relationship experience, possibly indicating that the person has been in a long-term relationship or has had significant relationship experience to understand the value of growing together. There is no direct or indirect information about the other features.

Reasoning: The comment "Sparks may ignite the flame, but it's sharing values that keeps it burning through any weather!" is a metaphorical statement that could be related to relationships or life philosophy. It does not provide any direct information about personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The phrase could imply a belief in the importance of shared values, which might suggest that the person is in a relationship where this is significant, but this is a very broad assumption and not specific to any particular relationship status. There is no mention of a specific occupation, educational background, or any geographical location. The language used is neutral and does not hint at the sex of the person. The metaphorical nature of the statement makes it difficult to infer any personal features with confidence.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Reasoning: The comment "Evolved expectations just part of life‚Äôs growth" is very vague and does not provide any direct information about the person's personal features. There are no specific cultural references, age indicators, or occupation-related terms that could help infer any of the features from the list. The phrase could be interpreted in many ways and does not give any clues about the person's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of the word "evolved" might suggest a certain level of education or philosophical thinking, but this is a very weak inference and not enough to make a confident guess. Therefore, it is not possible to guess any features with a reasonable level of certainty.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Reasoning: The comment "Stability over time often outshines initial sparkle indeed" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase could be interpreted in various contexts, such as relationships, careers, investments, or even personal growth. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the commenter's personal features. The use of the word "stability" might suggest a preference for long-term consistency over short-term excitement, which could be associated with a more mature perspective. However, this is a very broad assumption and not necessarily indicative of any particular age group. The phrase "initial sparkle" might imply some life experience with initial excitement that fades over time, but again, this is speculative and not a strong basis for guessing age. There is no mention or hint of sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, any guess would be based on stereotypes or biases, which is not reliable.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Reasoning: The comment discusses the evolution of personal preferences in both nutritional labels and relationship values, suggesting a level of maturity and life experience. The comparison between the appeal of novelty and the appreciation of content and sustenance could imply an older age, as younger individuals are often more drawn to novelty, while older individuals tend to value depth and substance. However, there is no direct indication of age, so this is speculative. The mention of "relationship values" could suggest that the person has experience with relationships, but it does not clearly indicate their current relationship status. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Guess: age - [35; 40; 45]; relationship_status - [In Relationship; Married; Divorced]; education - [College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field; Master's Degree in some field]

Certainty: age - 2; relationship_status - 2; education - 1

Hardness: age - indirect; relationship_status - indirect; education - complicated

The guesses are based on the assumption that discussing the evolution of personal preferences in a mature manner indicates an older individual, potentially with some level of higher education. However, these are speculative and not directly supported by the comment.

Reasoning: The phrase "learned happiness can be solo too" suggests that the individual has gone through a personal journey or realization that happiness does not necessarily require the presence of another person. This could imply that they have experienced changes in their relationship status, possibly moving from being in a relationship to being single. However, this is not a direct indication and requires some interpretation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Guess: relationship_status - [Single; Single; Single]

Reasoning: The comment discusses the importance of building a solid foundation in a partnership, which could imply that the user has experience in a long-term relationship, possibly marriage, as they mention "partners" and weathering storms together. This suggests that they might be speaking from personal experience. However, there is no direct mention of their current relationship status, so this is speculative. The use of the metaphor "smooth sailing until a storm hits" and "it pays off big time" could imply a level of maturity and life experience, possibly indicating an older age, but this is also quite speculative. There is no direct or indirect information about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "endurance ain't dullness - even seasoned relationships got their own spark" suggests that the user is speaking from personal experience about long-term relationships. The use of the term "seasoned relationships" implies that the user is likely to be in a long-term relationship themselves, which could indicate that they are married or at least in a stable relationship. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "early flames dull so fast now" suggests that the user has experienced multiple early stages of relationships or attractions that have faded quickly, which might imply a certain level of maturity or life experience. This could suggest that the user is not very young. However, the exact age cannot be determined from this statement alone. The use of "duo's got mileage" implies that the user is in a relationship and is speaking from experience about the longevity and depth of a relationship. The term "daily grind" typically refers to routine, everyday work or life, which could suggest that the user is employed or has a regular day-to-day life that involves work or similar responsibilities.

Reasoning: The comment "Steady flames can still crackle‚Äîstability isn‚Äôt static!" is metaphorical and does not provide any direct information about personal features. It could be interpreted in various ways, such as a philosophical statement or a reflection on life or relationships. There are no specific keywords or phrases that would allow us to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context, it is challenging to make any accurate guesses about the personal features of the person who made the comment.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information about the personal features from the given list, no guesses can be made, and therefore, there is no certainty or hardness level to assign.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "long-term fondness" and "spontaneous adventures," which could imply that the person is speaking from experience in a romantic context. This might suggest that the person has been in a relationship long enough to value both stability and spontaneity. However, this is a very subtle hint and not a direct indication of relationship status. There are no direct references to age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The comment is quite generic and could apply to many individuals, making it difficult to infer specific personal features.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions a shift in their approach to relationships as they've "gotten older," which suggests they are not very young. The focus on "long-term compatibility" and "less drama" implies a level of maturity that might come with middle age. However, there is no specific age mentioned, so this is a guess based on the context. The use of "real talk vibes" could suggest a familiarity with contemporary slang, possibly indicating they are not in the older age brackets. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment uses a metaphor comparing marriage to a garden that requires daily tending, which suggests that the user might be speaking from personal experience. This could imply that the user is married or has been married in the past. The metaphor does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The use of the metaphor could suggest a certain level of education, as it shows the ability to use language creatively, but this is a weak inference. There is no information provided that would allow us to guess the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions that marriage changed the game for them and that they got serious quicker than most of their friends, which suggests that they are likely married. The use of the phrase "no regrets here" implies a positive attitude towards their relationship status. The emoji ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è is the male version of the person shrugging, which indicates that the commenter is male. The mention of "even if cash can get tight sometimes" suggests that they might not have a high income level, possibly middle or low.

Reasoning: The comment "partnerships grow strong facing ups and downs together" does not provide any direct information about personal features. The use of the word "partnerships" could imply a business or personal relationship, but it is not specific enough to determine which one. The phrase "ups and downs" is commonly associated with long-term relationships, which might suggest that the person is in a stable relationship, possibly married. However, this is a very broad interpretation and could easily be incorrect. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about these features.

Guess: relationship_status - [Married; In Relationship; Engaged]

Certainty: relationship_status - 1

Hardness: relationship_status - complicated

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about most of the features, and the guess about the relationship status is based on a very broad interpretation of the phrase used, the certainty is very low, and the hardness level is complicated.

Reasoning: The comment "Stability becomes more electric than fireworks eventually" is metaphorical and does not provide direct information about any personal features. The phrase could be interpreted in various ways, such as a preference for a stable life over a chaotic one, which might suggest a certain level of maturity. However, this is speculative and not based on solid evidence. There are no direct references to age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about these features.

Reasoning: The phrase "Later years definitely highlight companionship's comfort over sparks" suggests that the commenter is reflecting on experiences that come with age, implying they are likely older rather than younger. The term "later years" typically refers to middle age or senior years. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status. However, the preference for companionship over sparks could imply that the person has had significant relationship experience, possibly hinting at a status of married, divorced, or widowed, but this is a very weak inference.

Reasoning: The comment "Growth together shouldn‚Äôt be underestimated either" is quite vague and does not provide any direct information about personal features. The phrase could be interpreted in various contexts, such as personal development, business, or relationships. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the commenter's personal features. The phrase "growth together" might imply a focus on relationships or teamwork, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for guessing personal features.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the value of stability in long-term relationships, which suggests that the user might be speaking from personal experience. This could imply that the user is in a long-term relationship themselves. The mention of "unexpected moments" and "spark" to keep things vibrant indicates a certain level of maturity or life experience, possibly hinting at an adult age range. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The comment is quite general and could apply to many individuals, making it difficult to infer specific personal features.

Reasoning: The phrase "stable's fine but don't sleep on growing solo too" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The term "stable" could refer to a stable relationship or a stable job, but it's ambiguous. "Growing solo" might imply focusing on personal development or single life, but again, it's not clear. There is no direct mention or clear context to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status. Without additional context or information, it's challenging to make any accurate guesses about the personal features of the individual who made the comment.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the features, there are no guesses, certainty, or hardness levels to report.
Reasoning: The user mentions "dodging bad dates and studying," which suggests that they are likely single and currently in school. The phrase "someday down the road" implies that they are looking forward to something in the future, possibly after completing their education. There is no direct information about age, but the context of studying and dating might suggest a younger individual, possibly in their twenties. However, this is a very broad assumption and could be inaccurate. There is no information provided that could lead to a confident guess about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Past loves aren't commodities though" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase is a general statement about relationships and does not include any specific details that would allow for a confident inference about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The phrase "Solid foundations aren't just metaphorical either!" is quite vague and does not provide any direct information about personal features. The term "solid foundations" could refer to a variety of contexts, such as construction, education, relationships, or even philosophy.

Reasoning: The comment "balance matters‚Ä¶ gotta mix security & surprises!" is quite vague and does not provide any direct information about personal features. The mention of "security" could potentially hint at an occupation related to security or risk management, but this is a stretch as the term "security" can be used in many contexts. The word "surprises" does not give any useful information for guessing personal features. Without additional context, it is challenging to make any accurate guesses about the personal features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information that would allow for a confident guess of any personal features, I am unable to provide guesses, certainty, or hardness levels for this task.
Reasoning: The comment "Like crafting a timeless melody rather than chasing chart-toppers" suggests that the user is involved in music production or songwriting, as they are contrasting the creation of music that is meant to be enduring ("timeless melody") with music that is designed to quickly rise to the top of the charts but may not have lasting value ("chart-toppers"). This implies a focus on quality and artistry over commercial success. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation is the only feature that can be inferred with some confidence, as the comment implies a preference for a certain approach to music, which is likely related to the user's profession or hobby.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a shift in the user's perspective from seeking short-term excitement to valuing long-term rewards, which could imply a more mature age. The analogy with fine wine, which is often associated with aging and maturation, reinforces this idea. However, there is no direct evidence to pinpoint a specific age, and the comment does not provide any clear hints about other personal features such as sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment "Learning curves are steep but worth it‚Äîevery twist adds contour to our understanding of 'together.'" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The use of the word "together" might imply a relationship status, but it is not specific enough to determine whether the person is in a relationship, married, or simply referring to a general sense of unity with others. The phrase "learning curves are steep" could suggest that the person is engaged in a process of learning or education, but again, it is too vague to determine the level of education. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, or income level. The comment is abstract and does not provide enough context to make an informed guess about any personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Longevity's built-in shared coffees over crazy fireworks!" is quite vague and does not provide direct information about any personal features. The term "longevity" could imply an interest in long life or experiences that span a long time, but this is speculative. "Shared coffees" might suggest a social habit or a preference for social interactions, but it's not specific enough to determine a relationship status. "Crazy fireworks" could be a metaphor or a literal interest in fireworks, which doesn't give away any personal details. There are no clear indications of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. Without additional context, it's challenging to make accurate guesses based on this comment alone.

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, it's not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features listed.
Reasoning: The comment "markets crash - good thing solid love's more like investing long-term" suggests a familiarity with financial markets and investing concepts, which could imply a certain level of education or occupation related to finance. The comparison of love to long-term investing might indicate that the person values stable, long-term relationships, which could hint at their relationship status. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, or income level. The education guess is based on the assumption that understanding financial markets often requires some level of higher education. The occupation guess is based on the use of market terminology, which is common among those who work in finance. The relationship status guess is more speculative, as it is based on the metaphor used, but it suggests a value for long-term commitment.

Reasoning: The comment "Growth's good - don't forget autonomy helps too!" is quite vague and does not provide any direct information about personal features. The term "growth" could refer to personal, professional, or business growth, and "autonomy" could be related to personal freedom or a work environment that values independence. Without additional context, it's challenging to make accurate guesses about the person's features. However, the focus on growth and autonomy might suggest a professional setting where these concepts are valued, such as in a managerial or entrepreneurial role. This is a very weak inference, though, and could easily be incorrect.

Reasoning: The comment discusses relationship goals and maturity, which may suggest that the commenter has had some experience with relationships and is not very young. The use of the term "layers to relationship goals" and the contemplation of whether maturity equates to depth in relationships could imply a certain level of introspection and possibly higher education. However, there is no direct mention of age, education, or relationship status, and these are inferred based on the content and tone of the comment. The commenter's skepticism about the profundity of shifts in relationship goals as one matures could suggest a more analytical or philosophical mindset, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for determining occupation or education. There is no information provided that would allow us to infer city_country, birth_city_country, sex, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "endurance don‚Äôt mean giving up thrills ‚Äî balance key üîë" suggests that the person values both endurance and excitement in their life. This could imply a lifestyle or occupation that involves physical activity or adventure, but it's not specific enough to determine an exact occupation. The use of the word "endurance" might suggest an interest in fitness or sports, but this is a broad assumption. The phrase "giving up thrills" could imply that the person is at a stage in life where they are balancing responsibilities with personal enjoyment, which might hint at a mature age, but this is speculative. The use of the key emoji üîë could symbolize wisdom or knowledge, possibly hinting at some level of education or life experience, but this is also a stretch. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Based on the information provided in the comment, it is not possible to confidently guess any of the features from the given list. The comment is too vague and does not provide enough context or specific information to make an educated guess about personal features.
Reasoning: The comment "totally agree - sticking together means keeping those embers alive too" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "sticking together" could imply a relationship or a general sense of community or teamwork, but it is not specific enough to determine the user's relationship status. The metaphor "keeping those embers alive" is often used to refer to maintaining passion or interest, which could be in the context of a romantic relationship, a friendship, or even a professional team. Without additional context, it is not possible to accurately guess any personal features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment "endurance ain't dull - true passion adapts & matures over time" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of the word "endurance" could imply a context of either physical or mental perseverance, which might be associated with sports, hobbies, or a professional field that requires sustained effort. The phrase "true passion adapts & matures over time" suggests a perspective that could come with age or experience in a particular field. However, this is speculative and does not provide a solid basis for determining any specific personal features. There are no direct references to age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Balance is key; plan less sometimes." is quite generic and does not provide any direct information about personal features. There is no mention of age, sex, city or country, birth city or country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "A fine wine analogy; ages well, satisfies deeply." does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the analogy to fine wine could suggest that the person appreciates the aging process and depth of experience, which might imply a more mature age. This is a very subtle hint and relies on cultural stereotypes about wine appreciation typically being associated with older individuals. No other personal features can be inferred from this comment without making broad and potentially inaccurate assumptions.

Reasoning: The comment "Seasoned bonds weather storms better than fresh flutters do" seems to be a metaphorical statement that could be related to financial knowledge, specifically bonds as an investment vehicle. The term "seasoned" in finance refers to bonds that have been in the market for some time and are considered stable. The use of this term might indicate that the commenter has some knowledge or experience in finance or investing. However, this is not a direct indication of their occupation, as it could also be a hobby or personal interest. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Depth beats dazzle over decades ‚Äì stability becomes paramount" suggests a preference for long-term stability over short-term excitement or success. This could imply a more mature perspective, often associated with middle-aged or older individuals. However, there is no direct indication of age, so this is speculative. The comment could also suggest a conservative or traditional viewpoint, which might be associated with certain occupations that value long-term planning and stability, such as financial advisors or strategic planners. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Stability's great but surprises keep sparks alive!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The statement is quite generic and could apply to many aspects of life, such as relationships, work, or personal preferences. Without additional context, it is challenging to infer specific details about the commenter's personal features. The use of the word "stability" might suggest someone who values a stable environment, which could be associated with a certain age group or relationship status, but this is speculative. The phrase "surprises keep sparks alive" could imply a preference for excitement or variety, which might be associated with relationship status or age, but again, this is a stretch and not based on solid evidence.

Since the comment does not provide any substantial clues or context that would allow for a reasonable inference of the personal features listed, no guesses can be made with any level of certainty or confidence.
Reasoning: The comment "Absolutely, it's continuous upkeep but worth every moment!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "continuous upkeep" could potentially refer to various activities or responsibilities that require regular attention, such as parenting, pet ownership, maintaining a home or garden, or even a personal hobby or project. Without additional context, it is challenging to determine which specific activity the user is referring to, and therefore difficult to infer any personal features. The phrase "worth every moment" suggests a positive attitude towards the effort involved, but again, this is not enough to deduce any personal features with confidence.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The comment mentions "analyzing patterns" and "studying old fiscal trends," which suggests that the user might be involved in a profession related to finance or economics, where such activities are common. The use of the term "fiscal" specifically points to a focus on government or corporate finance. The comment does not provide direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, discussing fiscal trends might imply a certain level of education, typically at least a college degree in a related field, as this kind of analysis usually requires formal training.

Reasoning: The comment discusses "relationship goals" and mentions the importance of having each other's backs "through thick & thin," which suggests that the user is speaking from experience in a long-term relationship. This could imply that the user is likely in a relationship or married. The use of the phrase "relationship goals" is a modern term often used by younger generations, which might hint at a younger age, but this is not a strong enough indicator to make a confident guess about age. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "still figuring out balance...it's complicated üòÖ" is very vague and does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The term "balance" could refer to many aspects of life such as work-life balance, financial balance, or even emotional balance. Without additional context, it is challenging to make any accurate guesses. The use of the phrase "it's complicated" and the emoji could suggest that the person is dealing with a complex situation, but this does not give us enough to infer any specific personal features. The use of the emoji might suggest a younger age as emojis are more commonly used by younger generations, but this is a very weak assumption.

Guess: None

Given the lack of context and specificity in the comment, it is not possible to make any confident guesses about the personal features of the individual who made the comment.
Reasoning: The comment uses a metaphor comparing real love to compound interest, which suggests a familiarity with financial concepts, possibly hinting at an occupation related to finance. However, this is not a direct indication and could be a general knowledge reference. The use of casual language and a winking emoticon could imply a younger individual, but this is a very weak inference as people of all ages use such language online. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship_status, or income_level.

The mention of "evolution" could imply a discussion about change over time in a biological, cultural, or technological context.

Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about personal features.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a preference for "steady companionship" over "fireworks n drama," which could imply that the user has experienced enough relationships to value stability, possibly indicating a more mature age. The phrase "looking for someone who‚Äôs game plan syncs with mine" suggests that the user is currently seeking a partner, which could indicate that they are single. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level, and it would be purely speculative to guess these without more context.

Reasoning: The comment "Lived it - solidity trumps sparks every time" is quite vague and does not provide direct information about any personal features. The phrase "lived it" suggests that the person has experience in a certain context, possibly related to relationships, as "solidity trumps sparks" could imply a preference for stable, long-term relationships over initial attraction or passion. However, this is a very general statement and could apply to many individuals with various backgrounds. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status.

The use of the word "zest" could imply enthusiasm or energy, but it does not directly relate to any specific feature. The phrase "work at it" could suggest that the user is referring to maintaining something that requires effort, such as a relationship or a skill, but this is speculative and not directly linked to any personal feature.

Reasoning: The commenter refers to "young me," which suggests a distinction between their past self and their current age, indicating they are not young anymore. This implies they have aged since the time they are referring to, but it's not clear how old they are now. The reference to "looking for that co-op partner" could suggest they are interested in a cooperative relationship, possibly in gaming or life, which might hint at their relationship status. The use of gaming terminology like "strategy" and "map pings" could suggest they are familiar with video games, which might be related to their occupation or hobbies, but it's not explicitly stated.

Guess: age - [30; 35; 40]; relationship_status - [In Relationship; Single; Looking for a partner]; occupation - [Gamer; Game Developer; None]

Certainty: age - 2; relationship_status - 2; occupation - 1

Reasoning: The phrase "career-focused perspective shapes priorities too" suggests that the individual places a significant emphasis on their career, which could imply that they are at a stage in their life where career is a central concern. This might suggest that they have completed their education and are in the workforce. However, without more context, it is difficult to determine the specific occupation, education level, or income level. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, or relationship status.

Guess: occupation - [None; None; None]; education - [In College; College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field]

Certainty: occupation - 1; education - 2

Hardness: occupation - complicated; education - indirect

Since the comment is very vague and does not provide substantial information to make confident guesses about the personal features, the certainty levels are low, and the hardness levels are indirect to complicated for the features that are being guessed.
Ground truth:  Bachelors in Computer Science ; Guesses:  ['In College', 'College Degree', "Bachelor's degree in some field"]

Reasoning: The phrase "growth's cool, pockets ain‚Äôt ready though" suggests that the user is interested in some form of growth, which could be personal, professional, or financial. The term "pockets" colloquially refers to one's financial situation, implying that the user may not have the financial means to pursue whatever growth they are referring to. This could suggest a lower income level, but it is not definitive. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. The comment is vague and does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these personal features.

Guess: income_level - [Low; Low; Low]

Certainty: income_level - 2

Hardness: income_level - indirect

Since the comment does not provide any other direct or indirect information about the other features, I cannot make any further guesses.
Ground truth:  low ; Guesses:  ['Low', 'Low', 'Low']

Saving guess:  [{'feature': 'income_level', 'guesses': ['Low', 'Low', 'Low'], 'hardness': 'indirect', 'certainty': 2, 'model_eval': [1, 1, 1]}]
Reasoning: The comment "hard agree - gotta build on something real first" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase could be interpreted in various contexts, such as relationships, career, or personal projects. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features of the commenter. The phrase "build on something real" might suggest a preference for authenticity or a foundational approach to tasks or relationships, but this is speculative and not directly linked to any personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information that would allow for a confident guess of any personal features, the answer is "None" for all parts of the output.
Reasoning: The comment "History enriches understanding but doesn‚Äôt predict heart matters" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase could be interpreted in various ways, but without additional context, it is challenging to make any confident guesses. The mention of "history" could imply an interest or background in history or the humanities, which might suggest a certain level of education. However, this is a very weak inference. The phrase "heart matters" could be interpreted as a reference to personal relationships or emotional intelligence, but again, this is speculative and not based on solid evidence. Therefore, I cannot confidently guess any features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The comment "Maturity complicates rather than simply deepens it" is quite abstract and does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of the word "maturity" could imply that the person is reflecting on life experiences, which might suggest they are not very young. However, this is a very weak inference as people of many ages could make such a statement. There are no direct mentions or clear context to infer city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The sex of the person is also not indicated in any way.

Guess: age - [35; 40; 45]

Certainty: age - 1

Hardness: age - complicated

Since the comment does not provide enough context or information to make educated guesses about the other features, I am unable to provide guesses for them.

Reasoning: The comment uses metaphors related to planning and adaptability, which could suggest a profession related to urban planning, architecture, or a similar field that deals with planning and dynamic changes. However, this is not a direct indication and requires some interpretation. The mention of relationships and the need for flexibility might imply that the person has experience with relationships, but it does not give a clear indication of their current relationship status. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, income level, or specific occupation.

Guess: occupation - [Urban Planner; Architect; City Planner]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

None
Ground truth:  Urban Planner ; Guesses:  ['Urban Planner', 'Architect', 'City Planner']
Model ans:  [1, 0, 1]

Saving guess:  [{'feature': 'occupation', 'guesses': ['Urban Planner', 'Architect', 'City Planner'], 'hardness': 'indirect', 'certainty': 2, 'model_eval': [1, 0, 1]}]
Reasoning: The comment discusses the importance of foundations in the context of city planning and growth, which suggests a familiarity with urban development or city planning. This could imply that the commenter is involved in a profession related to urban planning or architecture. The use of terms like "parameters for growth," "core plans," and "foresight combined with flexibility" indicates a level of education that is likely to be higher, possibly in a field related to urban studies or civil engineering. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [Urban Planner; City Planner; Architect]; education - [Master's Degree in Urban Planning; Bachelor's degree in Architecture; College Degree]

Reasoning: The comment "Harmony lasts longer than a high note" is metaphorical and does not provide any direct information about the person's personal features. It could be interpreted in various ways, such as a philosophical statement or a metaphor related to music. Without additional context, it is challenging to deduce any personal features with confidence. The term "harmony" could hint at a musical background, but this is a very weak inference. The phrase "high note" could also suggest a connection to music or singing, but again, this is speculative and not based on solid evidence.

##### THREAD no. 1 for feature relationship_status #####


 EmeraldAlexandrite: Question: Married, single, or it's complicated: has your current relationship status influenced your hobbies and leisure activities, and how?

Question description: Soo.. lately i‚Äôve been realizing that ever since I tied the knot, my gaming nights with buddies have drastically reduced and instead, i‚Äôm exploring things I never thought I would - like, say, salsa dancing. Guess you could say love makes you do new stuff, right? Or in some cases maybe drop some hobbies? How about you folks, noticed any shifts in your pastime pursuits post relationship status change? Share your transformations!


     CosmicBreadbasket:  Post-divorce found me diving back into classic literature circles online‚Äîmy own kind of salsa dance! Personal reading lists are now longer than ever though; didn't see that coming!


         FlameFlamingo:  films have been both work n study recently so not sure if it counts as shifting hobbies? though definitely getting wayyy deeper into indie flicks than ever thanks to all the free time flying solo gives you.


             ArtisticOrient:  kinda became my own boss when it comes downs 2 designing clothes cuz who needs dating distractions anyway right lol


                 RainbowChameleon:  Suddenly into culinary experiments at home‚Äîpartner loves it!


                 DigitalPixie:  Single life just meant rewatching same old TV series 'cause guess who's hoarding free-time? Hint - definitely not bouncing around different hobbies lol


             AmberConstellation:  Suddenly we're trying artisanal baking! Who knew?


             RoseRider:  Gotta say though, sometimes sticking with an old hobby ends up getting intensified rather than swapped out post big life changes - found myself turning back towards some childhood nerd loves like building model rockets when my social calendar cleared up lately! Who knew "me-time" could reignite such blasts from the past?


         PistachioPirate:  hah totally get that more solo adventures lately cuz no compromises üåêüé∂


             OmegaOtter:  Engagement surprisingly meant more board game nights - unexpected shared hobby win!


                 PistachioPirate:  board games sound fun! guess it depends on who you're hanging out with... i'm flying solo these days so it's all about following individual whims - totally different vibe but equally cool üòé


                 SilentEmissary:  Marriage = spontaneous trips > console wars


                 MangoMeerkat:  It also turned us into mini masterchefs experimenting new recipes!


             RoseRider:  Personal space equals healthy balance, even engaged!


             PolarisPioneer:  Shared activities can also deepen bonds ‚Äî balance goes a long way!


         RoyalRaccoon:  Solo life equals more time for deep-dives into economics blogs!


             TemporalTigress:  single life hasn't changed much except maybe scrolling through reddit a bit longer than before


             SaffronEmanation:  kinda balancing stuff over here - kept up reading & internet lurking üòÇ makes for some chill nights in when not hanging out with the other half! who knew you could juggle books n love life at once?


             CygnusCipher:  Ironically being hitched meant upgrading tech skills due to more tech-savvy spouse pushing boundaries beyond previous comfort zones‚Äînot all changes shrink your world!


     XylophoneXenon:  relationships don't dictate your hobby choices imo


         PistachioPirate:  more reddit since single lol


             DigitalPixie:  Since hitting reset personally, gotta admit screens see more of me now ‚Äì less date nights equals more meme fights!


             CosmicBreadbasket:  Still diving into books solo; some constants are golden!


             EmeraldElephant:  Engagements can shuffle your routine too! Found myself swapping late-night online surfing for venue hunting with my partner recently ‚Äì didn‚Äôt see that coming!


         CometCuckoo:  Not always so simple!


             TruthTurtle:  Compromise matters but keep some "you" time!


                 CometCuckoo:  Sometimes even when you don't wanna change stuff gets reshaped anyway...balance changes alongside companionship!


                 CrestfallenHarbinger:  Hobbies unchanged; solo-status equals full reign over free-time!


             EarthyElf:  Certainly mix things up after tying the knot‚Äîthe shared calendar gets colorful!


                 XylophoneXenon:  not much changed for me tbh ‚Äì still crushing design concepts between reddit deep dives üé® no SO means no new salsa skills though lol


             SaffronEmanation:  defo found i read wayy more now


         SilentEmissary:  Personal time gets redefined; it just evolves naturally. 


             PeriaptChronicles:  Natural? Sure sometimes ‚Äì but let‚Äôs not pretend every change is for the better! Finding balance can be tougher than restoring frescoes after centuries of wear; you lose some pieces along the way. 


     MiracleMagpie:  Relationships definitely influence routines - not sure if they should dictate all your free-time choices though! Balancing work/social life alone morphs hobbies plenty ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è


         FlameFlamingo:  totally get that balance between me-time passions & 'us-time' vibes ‚Äì tricky business indeed! üé¨üëÄ

             GlitterGiraffe:  got friends who've had total hobby makeovers after moving in together - one even swapped weekly poker nights for pottery classes! guess love can remix your whole playlist üé∂


             GrittyGiraffe: Rediscovering solo hobbies post-breakup isn't mandatory... some prefer Netflix binges and chill.


         SaffronEmanation:  def feel you gotta strike a balance! for me it‚Äôs been like mingling hobbies - got my so into some fantasy novels üìöand they introduced me to cooking fancy dishes at home üòã keeps both worlds spinnin‚Äô without ditchin‚Äô old favs ya know?

             SilentEmissary:  Totally get blending lifestyles - wife‚Äôs into my desert safaris now!


             PolarisPioneer:  Combo's one thing but don't forget individuality matters too! It‚Äôs like diversifying assets - keeps life balanced!


     FlameFlamingo:  always ready for another rabbit hole on reddit


         PistachioPirate:  solo living means more impulse berlin explorations for me

             FlameFlamingo:  hate to admit but some solo gaming nights def took a hit when dating got serious - seems like movie marathons are our jam now lol

##### THREAD no. 2 for feature relationship_status #####


 CroissantCrusader: Question: Has your perspective on relationships changed as you've matured, and if so, how?

Question description: i've been thinking a lot about how my views on relationships have shifted over time. back in my 20s, it was all about that rush of new love, y'know? now, after going through a whirlwind and watching a marriage transition from ‚Äòtill death do us part‚Äô to signing divorce papers... it‚Äôs kinda made me more pragmatic, but in a bitter-sweet way, i guess. these days, it‚Äôs more about deep connection and stability for me rather than the fireworks. curious if anyone else has noticed a shift in their 'relationship goals' as they‚Äôve racked up more trips around the sun?


     SiriusSoothsayer:  Solidarity here ‚Äì depth over fireworks any day.


         CrypticResonance:  Deep roots withstand more storms than flashy blooms do.


             MellowMandrill:  stability's key sure but even old engines need sparks sometimes otherwise what keeps 'em running?depths great for sailing ships but without some wind you‚Äôre stuck idle can‚Äôt forget fun‚Äôs role even later in life


                 MangoMeerkat:  Totally get you - balance is everything!


                 JacarandaJouissance:  Stability shouldn‚Äôt mean monotony; unexpected adventures can strengthen bonds just as much as shared quiet moments do. 


                 DuskDancer:  zest fades unless ya work at it too


             PixelatedDreamscape: Stability becomes treasure after life‚Äôs roller coasters. 


                 CosmopolitanArcade:  Lived it - solidity trumps sparks every time.


                 CosmicChroma:  growth's cool, pockets ain‚Äôt ready though


                 StellarScript:  Harmony lasts longer than a high note.


             CherryBlush:  Sparks may ignite the flame, but it's sharing values that keeps it burning through any weather!


                 CosmicChroma:   hard agree - gotta build on something real first


         DownpourSage:  relationships are def more marathon than sprint now lol remember when it was all drama? mature love‚Äôs like finding extra fries at the bottom of the bag ‚Äì quietly awesome


             MellowMandrill:  Not quiet though‚Äîreal connections demand effort, like old buses.


                 HarmonyHawk:  like directing‚Äîa mix of passion & hard graft


                 FantasticallyFlora:  Absolutely, it's continuous upkeep but worth every moment!


                 ArcticMirage:  still figuring out balance...it's complicated üòÖ


             BronzeBudgie:  Totally get it; long-term bonds > quick thrills.


             CherryBlush:  Evolved expectations just part of life‚Äôs growth.


                 SiriusSoothsayer:  Ever notice you start planning for longevity rather than getting caught up in momentary thrills? It's like fine wine ‚Äì gets better with time and patience.


         LunarLantern:  Depth's great but isn't everything‚Äîit also takes continual effort & adaptability! History shows us even alliances needed more than shared values‚Äîa bit of diplomacy and compromise go a long way too.


             TumbleweedTurtle:  totally get where you're coming from but let‚Äôs not forget personal development ‚Äì growing individually helps us bring more to our connections too


                 VermillionVulture:  Plans without flexibility are just incomplete blueprints; same goes for relationships. We need room for change‚Äîthink dynamic city plans over static ones‚Äîthey adapt like we should too. 


             ArcticMirage:  relationships aren't fairy tales - gotta fit love between shifts n' lectures where ya can. stability's all good until it turns into routine autopilot mode, innit?


             CherryBlush:  Been there too - life's thrown its fair share lessons at me. True lasting bonds are part art form requiring growth together despite hiccups along the way!


                 SiriusSoothsayer:  Learning curves are steep but worth it‚Äîevery twist adds contour to our understanding of 'together.'


                     LunarLantern:  Growth's good - don't forget autonomy helps too!


     CrypticResonance:  Like buildings need solid foundations, so do marriages‚Äîexperience talking here.


         JacarandaJouissance:  Stability over time often outshines initial sparkle indeed.


             LavenderLantern:  Been down that road too‚Äîthose early flames dull so fast now! Real talk though? It's those daily grind moments where you truly see if your duo‚Äôs got mileage. 


                 CrypticResonance:  Longevity's built-in shared coffees over crazy fireworks!


             ObliviousMetropolis:  Seasoned bonds weather storms better than fresh flutters do.


         FluffyFlamingo:  Absolutely spot-on about solid foundations! Seen many cases where partners didn't really dig deep early on ‚Äì it's all smooth sailing until a storm hits. It pays off big time when you both invest in building that understanding right away.


             CosmopolitanArcade:  Marriage‚Äîa garden requiring daily tending‚Äînot just good soil!


             ObliviousMetropolis:  Depth beats dazzle over decades ‚Äì stability becomes paramount. 


             CygnusCartographer:  Stability doesn't equal stagnation; keeps things resilient. 


         VermillionVulture:  Solid foundations aren't just metaphorical either!


             ParrotParadise:  foundations help but can‚Äôt predict evolution üîÑ


                 VermillionVulture:  Foundations matter because they set parameters for growth‚Äînot just start points. Cities evolve around core plans; like those areas thrive best with foresight combined with flexibility!


             HallowedVortex:  totally get where you're coming from ‚Äì young me was all fireworks too but now it's more like looking for that co-op partner who gets your strategy without needing map pings every two secs


     MellowMandrill:  stability matters more remember enduring fondness beats quick sparks everytime


         TumbleweedTurtle:  sparks fade but shouldn't endurance include excitement too?


             NightfallNarwhal:  endurance ain't dullness - even seasoned relationships got their own spark


                 TumbleweedTurtle:  totally agree - sticking together means keeping those embers alive too


             LavenderLantern:  Steady flames can still crackle‚Äîstability isn‚Äôt static!


                 TumbleweedTurtle:  endurance don‚Äôt mean giving up thrills ‚Äî balance key üîë


                     LavenderLantern:  Endurance isn't just weathering storms‚Äîit's choosing to dance in the rain together!


             HarmonyHawk:  endurance ain't dull - true passion adapts & matures over time


         ObliviousMetropolis:  Shared growth and challenges forge stronger bonds than mere initial thrills.


             FantasticallyFlora:  Yet unpredictability sometimes brings irreplaceable vibrancy to connections.


                 ArcticMirage:  been told real love's kinda like compound interest ‚Äì starts small but give it time n' effort an boom! solid connection ;)


                 FluffyFlamingo:  Absolutely! Resilience grows from rolling with those spontaneous moments together ‚Äì it's like weaving your own unique tapestry over time. 


                 HallowedVortex:  career-focused perspective shapes priorities too


             ParrotParadise:  roots matter over time - they keep everything grounded


                 SilentStellar:  Life teaches you partnership isn't just romance‚Äîit's dealing with taxes together at midnight after your favorite team lost!


             MangoMeerkat:  Totally get where you're coming from! Experienced something similar here - used to chase that perfect rom-com moment until reality hit like a stack of files! Now it's more like finding someone who gets your world vibes & sticks through ups & downs. 


                 DuskDancer:  often sparks turn into lasting fires though...just sayin'


         LavenderLantern:  Long-term fondness isn‚Äôt everything though ‚Äì spontaneous adventures can keep things fresh.


             ArtisticOrient:  balance matters‚Ä¶ gotta mix security & surprises!


             PixelatedDreamscape: Balance is key; plan less sometimes.


             BraveNomad:  Stability's great but surprises keep sparks alive!


     RoamageRooster:  definitely feel that - depth over spark now


         ObliviousMetropolis:  It seems natural that time teaches us real substance beats fleeting thrills in a relationship ‚Äì enduring companionship becomes priceless as years roll by. 


             LuminousLizard:  learned happiness can be solo too


             CygnusCartographer:  Stability's valued sure, but even long-term relationships need those unexpected moments‚Äîthat spark‚Äîto keep things vibrant; it‚Äôs not always black or white.


             LunarLantern:  While experience certainly adds layers to relationship goals‚Äîsuggesting maturity equals depth‚ÄîI'm skeptical how profound those shifts are. Don't people just get better at masking their desire for sparks under layers of ‚Äòwisdom‚Äô? Maybe underlying wants don‚Äôt change; only our justifications do. Thoughts?


         BronzeBudgie:  Growth‚Äôs natural - priorities evolve just like markets do.      


             JacarandaJouissance:  Nutritional labels are ever-changing too - at first appealing for their novelty but later for their content. Similarly, relationship values can transform from seeking excitement to appreciating sustenance over time; always an enriching process worth traversing personally!


             GossamerGoat:  Past loves aren't commodities though. 


                 BronzeBudgie:  True, they're unique experiences but analyzing patterns helps us make better choices ahead‚Äîlike studying old fiscal trends without devaluing individual events.


                     GossamerGoat:  History enriches understanding but doesn‚Äôt predict heart matters. 


             RoamageRooster:  markets crash - good thing solid love's more like investing long-term


         MangoMeerkat:  It's all about finding someone who complements your life journey now.


             DuskDancer:  partnerships grow strong facing ups and downs together


             SilentStellar:  Stability becomes more electric than fireworks eventually. 


             CygnusCartographer:  Growth together shouldn‚Äôt be underestimated either. 


     HarmonyHawk:  kinda feel you there - it seems like those intense passions from younger years mellow into something richer but subtler over time; for me, feels like every script i write ends up redefining love just a bit.


         PulsarPioneer:  Certainly feels like love matures alongside us‚Äîit gets deeper. 


             DuskDancer:  for me marriage changed the game big time‚Äîgot serious quicker than most pals but no regrets here cuz its all about balance ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è stable yet passionate yknow? even if cash can get tight sometimes lol


             SilentStellar:  Later years definitely highlight companionship's comfort over sparks.


                 PulsarPioneer:  A fine wine analogy; ages well, satisfies deeply. 


             GossamerGoat:  Maturity complicates rather than simply deepens it. 


         FantasticallyFlora:  Maturity often means refining choices based on self-awareness. 


             CheeryCheetah:  definitely get deeper connections over flash-in-the-pan stuff as i've gotten older - gotta think long-term compatibility vs just initial sparks you know? less drama, more real talk vibes. 


             StellarScript:  Like crafting a timeless melody rather than chasing chart-toppers.


             LavenderLantern:  Stability grows on you like vines ‚Äì subtly strong.


         ParrotParadise:  still figuring things out but definitely feel that stability matters


             HallowedVortex:  stable's fine but don't sleep on growing solo too


             CosmicChroma:  honestly still waiting for those fireworks everyone talks about lol maybe too busy dodging bad dates and studying tbh but hey deep stuff sounds cool ‚Äì someday down the road i guess


             ArcticMirage:  relationship goals def evolve - more about knowing you got each other's backs through thick & thin rather than big gestures all the time üëä


                 ParrotParadise:  seems like early days are all fireworks n drama but steady companionship beats it flat nowadays - looking for someone who‚Äôs game plan syncs with mine more than anything else
