Reasoning: The commenter reflects on childhood memories, which suggests they are likely an adult reflecting on the past. The mention of "doll-playing" and "family reunions" could imply traditional gender roles, possibly indicating the commenter is female, as doll-playing is often associated with girls. The reference to "libraries" and "books" could suggest a fondness for reading and learning, which might indicate a higher level of education. However, there is no direct evidence of the commenter's current occupation, relationship status, income level, or specific age. The comment does not provide any direct information about the city or country of residence or birth.

Reasoning: The comment mentions that house chores were seen as "everyone's job" during the user's upbringing, which suggests a family environment that promoted gender equality. This could imply that the user's family did not adhere to traditional gender roles, but it does not give us direct information about the user's sex, age, or other personal features. The term "outdated" in reference to gender roles might suggest that the user is from a younger generation who views traditional gender roles as a thing of the past, but this is speculative. There is no direct information about the user's city, country, birth city, country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

The guesses are based on subtle societal cues and common stereotypes, which are not reliable indicators of personal features. Therefore, the certainty levels are low, and the hardness levels are indirect or complicated due to the lack of direct information in the comment.

Reasoning: The comment "Childhood hobbies shouldn't dictate careers; mixed signals growing up here" does not provide direct information about any of the personal features listed. The phrase "mixed signals growing up here" could imply that the person is reflecting on their own childhood, which might suggest that they are an adult, but it does not give a specific age. The comment does not mention any details that would indicate sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about these features.

Reasoning: The comment "def played more video games than football thanks dad lol" suggests that the person's father had an influence on their activities, possibly encouraging video games over sports. This could imply a more sedentary or indoor preference in hobbies, but it doesn't give us much to go on regarding the specific personal features from the list. The use of "lol" might suggest a younger individual who is familiar with internet slang, but this is not definitive. The mention of "dad" indicates that the person has a father, but this does not provide any specific information about the person's current relationship status. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.
Reasoning: The commenter mentions playing "pretend director" instead of football as a child, which suggests an early interest in film or media production. This interest seems to have carried into adulthood, as they mention working "behind the camera," which implies a current occupation in film or related media production. The phrase "instead of some corporate gig" suggests a choice made to pursue a creative field rather than a more traditional corporate job, which might be associated with higher income levels. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's income level, so this remains speculative. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a preference for "edit bays" over "ball courts," which suggests that the user may be involved in a profession related to film or video editing, as edit bays are commonly associated with that industry. The term "passion over stereotypes" could imply that the user is engaged in a field that is stereotypically less popular or glamorous than sports, which are associated with ball courts. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "as I got older" implies that the user has experienced a change in perspective over time, which suggests that the user is not very young. However, the exact age cannot be determined from this statement alone. The use of the term "nudges" might imply some familiarity with behavioral economics or psychology, but this is a weak inference and not enough to guess education or occupation. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions that the user's family pushed sports hard, which could imply that the user has some background in sports, possibly as an athlete or related occupation. However, this is not a direct indication of their current occupation. The mention of Reddit discussions broadening perspectives suggests that the user is engaged in online communities and values diverse viewpoints, which could hint at a certain level of education, but this is quite speculative. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The term "soccer mom" typically refers to a parent who is actively involved in their children's activities, particularly soccer. It often implies that the person is a mother, which suggests the sex of the user. The phrase "made me team captain at work" suggests that the user is employed and has been given a leadership role or responsibility, which could be metaphorical for a promotion or recognition. The use of "😅 perks" implies that there is some benefit or positive aspect to the situation mentioned, although it does not provide specific information about income level, education, or other personal features.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions having played football as a kid and not buying into "girly" stuff, which suggests that the commenter identifies as female and was likely a tomboy in her youth. This is a direct indication of her sex. The use of past tense "as a kid" implies that she is no longer a child, but without more context, it is impossible to determine her current age. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the other features such as city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions that they have always loved sports as a kid and are now a PE teacher. This directly indicates their occupation. The phrase "defy stereotypes much?" could imply that they are in a role or situation that is typically not associated with their demographic, but this is not a clear indication of any specific personal feature without additional context. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, we can infer that since they are a teacher, they likely have at least a college degree in education or a related field. The comment does not provide enough information to infer the other features with any reasonable level of certainty.

Reasoning: The comment "grew up running more than baking but hey you do you" suggests that the person has a history of running, which could imply an interest or background in athletics or related activities. However, this does not provide a direct indication of their current occupation. The phrase "you do you" is a contemporary colloquialism often used by younger generations, which might hint at the commenter's age, but it is not definitive. There is no direct or indirect information about the person's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions excelling in math contests, which suggests a strong aptitude in mathematics and possibly a related education or occupation. The mention of "artsy hobbies" implies a personal interest in the arts, but this is less informative regarding specific personal features. The phrase "Defying stereotypes" could hint at the commenter being of a gender that is typically not associated with excelling in math contests, but this is a weak inference and not enough to make a confident guess about sex. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter identifies as a "Math geek," which suggests a strong interest or background in mathematics. This could imply that they have pursued education in a math-related field. The use of the term "geek" is often colloquial for someone deeply interested in a subject, often implying they have studied it to some extent. The phrase "the only ‘figures’ family endorsed were stats" suggests that their family values education, particularly in statistics or mathematics. This could imply that the commenter has at least a college degree in a math-related field, as statistics is often a subject studied at the college level or higher. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "try juggling shift work" suggests that the commenter is likely engaged in a profession that requires shift work, which could be a variety of occupations such as nursing, law enforcement, or factory work. The term "old-school mentality at home" implies that the commenter may be dealing with traditional gender roles or expectations within their household, which could hint at their sex, possibly female, if they are contrasting their work life with traditional home life expectations. However, this is not a strong enough indication to make a confident guess about sex. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions growing up being encouraged towards sciences and considering it 'not girly,' which suggests that the commenter is female, as they are contrasting their interest in science with traditional gender norms. The term 'public health geek' implies that the commenter works in the public health field, which is an occupation. The mention of 'still loves her sci-fi novels just as much as getting glammed up' does not provide a direct hint towards age, but the fact that they are reflecting on childhood and have established interests and a career might suggest they are an adult, possibly in their late 20s to 40s. However, this is a very broad range and not a precise number, so it's not a confident guess. There is no direct information about education, but given the occupation in public health, it is likely that the commenter has at least a college degree in a related field. There is no information provided about city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "fashion drew me in early... sketchbooks beat soccer any day!" suggests that the user has an interest in fashion and prefers activities related to drawing or designing over sports like soccer. This could imply that the user is involved in a creative field, possibly related to fashion design. The phrase "drew me in early" might suggest that this interest started at a young age, which could have influenced their educational and career choices. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The education guess is based on the assumption that someone interested in fashion and sketching might pursue formal education in that field.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the influence of childhood toys and education on career choices, which suggests the user might be reflecting on their own experiences or observations in society. The mention of "society's job market biases" and "appropriate careers" could imply that the user has some knowledge or interest in education or social sciences, possibly hinting at their occupation. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

However, this is a very weak inference as the term could be used by anyone with a general interest in the subject or who has come across the term in casual reading. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a preference for books over sports from a young age, which could imply a more introverted or academic inclination. The phrase "bucks tradition" might suggest that the commenter is going against a societal norm, which could be related to gender roles, as they also mention not caring for "girly" or "manly" things. This could hint at the commenter's sex, potentially being female, as traditionally, it's more common for males to be pushed towards sports. However, this is not a strong enough indication to make a confident guess. The use of emojis and the casual tone do not provide clear evidence for any of the other features.

Given the information in the comment, it is not possible to confidently guess any of the features from the provided list without making broad assumptions based on stereotypes, which is not reliable.

Reasoning: The comment "Diverse workforce reshaped old-school thinking here" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the use of the term "diverse workforce" could imply that the commenter is involved in a professional environment that has undergone changes in its demographic composition. This might suggest that the commenter has an occupation related to human resources, management, or diversity and inclusion initiatives. The term "old-school thinking" could imply that the commenter has experienced different eras of workplace culture, possibly indicating a middle-aged individual. However, this is speculative and not based on strong evidence. There is no information provided that could lead to a confident guess about the commenter's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Excelled at business school - smashed those glass ceilings!" suggests that the user has attended and performed well in business school, which implies a certain level of education. The phrase "smashed those glass ceilings" is often used to describe overcoming barriers that women face in professional environments, which could hint at the user's sex. However, there is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions balancing long work hours with expected family roles, which suggests that the person is employed and has a family. The term "expected family roles" could imply traditional family responsibilities, which might be more commonly associated with being married. However, it does not provide enough information to determine the person's sex, age, city/country of residence or birth, education, occupation, or income level with any degree of certainty.

Reasoning: The comment mentions that the user's father had them code as a "brain exercise," which suggests that the user has some experience with coding, possibly as a hobby or part of their education, but not necessarily as a profession. The phrase "kitchen still alien territory" implies that the user is not familiar or comfortable with cooking, which could hint at a younger age or a lifestyle that doesn't involve cooking, such as living with parents or in a dormitory. There is no direct information about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

None of the other features from the list are mentioned or hinted at in the comment, so they cannot be guessed with any level of certainty.


'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
Reasoning: The user mentions not being interested in "mom's kitchen rumba" or "dad's sports craze," which suggests that they were exposed to these interests during their upbringing but did not adopt them. The phrase "gravitated towards biz strategy games" implies an interest in business and strategy from a young age. The current activity of "spinning deals" suggests that the user is now involved in a profession related to business, possibly in a role that involves negotiation or deal-making. The phrase "instead of tortillas" could imply a cultural background where tortillas are a common food item, which might suggest a Latin American or Hispanic heritage, but this is not a strong enough hint to determine city or country of origin.

Reasoning: The comment mentions helping "papá" with finance stuff, which suggests a family connection to finance. The use of "papá" instead of "dad" or "father" could imply a Hispanic or Spanish-speaking background. Being an "Excel champ" now indicates that the user has a strong proficiency in Excel, which is often associated with jobs in finance, data analysis, or similar fields that require data manipulation and spreadsheet skills. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Renaissance Florence," which could imply that the user has some knowledge of history or art history, possibly suggesting an education in these fields. However, this is not a strong indicator as it could be a general interest. The reference to "gender norms" might suggest that the user has an interest in gender studies or social sciences, but again, this is speculative. There is no direct information about the user's personal features, and the comment does not provide enough context to make confident guesses about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a preference for science kits over sports or physical activities like skateboarding. This could imply an interest in science from a young age, which might lead to a career in a science-related field. However, there is no direct information about the current occupation, so this is speculative. The avoidance of sports could also hint at a personality type or lifestyle choice rather than a specific age or sex. There is no direct information about the city, country, education level, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions trying soccer because "boys will be boys," which suggests that the commenter is male, as this phrase is typically associated with justifying typical male behavior. The commenter also expresses a preference for chess over soccer, which could imply a more strategic or intellectual occupation, although this is not a direct indication of a specific profession. There is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The term "soccer mom" is typically used to describe a middle-aged woman with children who are active in sports, particularly soccer. This term is often used in the United States, suggesting that the person may be from there. The comment also implies that the person is a mother, which suggests a certain age range and relationship status. However, the term "soccer mom" does not provide specific information about the exact age, income level, or education.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "growing up," which implies they are reflecting on their past, but no direct indication of current age is given. They also mention having studied economics ("econ studies"), which suggests they have at least some college education, as economics is typically studied at the college level or higher. The reference to gender roles and social constructs could imply a more liberal or progressive education, often associated with social sciences or humanities, but this is speculative. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions playing with Legos as a kid and still not building houses, which doesn't provide direct information about any personal features. However, we can infer a few things. The reference to playing with Legos 'as a kid' implies that the commenter is no longer a child, which suggests they are an adult. The fact that they 'still don't build houses' could imply that they are not in a profession related to construction or architecture, but this is a very weak inference. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The comment is vague and does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of the listed features.

Guess: age - [Adult; Adult; Adult]; occupation - [None; None; None]

Certainty: age - 2; occupation - 1

Hardness: age - indirect; occupation - complicated

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about the specific age, occupation, or any other personal features from the list, the guesses are very uncertain and based on very weak inferences. The occupation guess is marked as 'None' because there is no reasonable way to determine the commenter's occupation from the given information.


'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
Reasoning: The user's comment about finance and markets not discriminating suggests that they may work in the finance industry, as they seem to have an opinion on the nature of the industry. The mention of gender roles could imply that they have a personal stake in the conversation about gender discrimination, which might suggest their sex, but it is not explicit enough to make a confident guess. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [Finance Professional; Financial Analyst; Stock Trader]

Certainty: occupation - 3

Since the comment does not provide direct information about the other features, and there are no subtle hints that would allow for a confident guess, the other features are not guessable based on the provided information.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Shifts plus traditional role expectations," which suggests that the person is likely balancing work (implied by "shifts") with traditional family or household roles. This could hint at a profession that involves shift work, such as healthcare, emergency services, or hospitality. However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact occupation. The mention of "traditional role expectations" could imply that the person is in a relationship where such roles are expected, possibly hinting at a more traditional relationship status like married. However, this is a broad assumption and not very certain. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions growing up tossing footballs, which is a sport typically associated with boys, and contrasts this with playing dolls, which is stereotypically associated with girls. This suggests that the commenter is likely female, as she is highlighting a deviation from a gender stereotype. The commenter also mentions getting paid for giving fitness advice, which implies that her occupation is related to fitness or personal training. There is no direct information about age, but the phrase "haven't changed much" implies that the commenter is no longer a child and has been doing this for some time, suggesting that they are an adult. However, there is not enough information to make a precise guess about age.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions growing up watching archaeologist shows and aspiring to be like the archaeologists featured in those shows, which suggests a childhood interest in archaeology. This interest led them to study cultures, which could imply an education in anthropology, cultural studies, or a related field. The lack of interest in dolls and preference for myths over makeup could be a subtle hint towards the commenter's sex, suggesting they might be female, as this goes against the traditional gender stereotype of girls playing with dolls and being interested in makeup. However, this is not a definitive indication of sex, as interests do not necessarily align with gender.

Reasoning: The user identifies as a "History buff," which suggests a strong interest in history, potentially implying a level of education that includes history studies. However, this is not a direct indication of a specific degree. The preference for "ancient warrior queens over knights" does not provide a clear indication of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without more context, it's challenging to make accurate guesses about these personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the user's parents and the roles they played in their upbringing, with the father handling accounts and the mother managing home affairs. This suggests that the user was exposed to both financial and domestic tasks, which could imply that the user's education may have included some form of financial literacy or business skills, and also a balanced view on gender roles. However, there is no direct information about the user's current occupation, education, or other personal features. The phrase "kinda imprinted on me" suggests that these observations from childhood had a lasting impact, potentially influencing the user's values or career choices, but this is speculative.

Guess: education - [In College; College Degree; Bachelor's degree in Business]; occupation - [Accountant; Financial Advisor; Bookkeeper]; sex - [None; None; None]

Certainty: education - 2; occupation - 2; sex - 1

The guesses for education and occupation are based on the user's exposure to financial tasks through their father's role in handling accounts, which might have influenced their educational path or career choice. However, these are indirect inferences and not explicitly stated, hence the lower certainty and indirect hardness level. The sex of the user is not indicated in any way in the comment, so no guess is made for that feature.

Reasoning: The user mentions having aced debate competitions, which suggests they might have been involved in such activities during their education, possibly in high school or college. The use of past tense "aced" could imply that these competitions are not a current activity, which might suggest that the user is no longer in school. The mention of negotiation skills could indicate that the user has pursued a career where such skills are relevant, such as law, business, or diplomacy. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Even rocks are breaking stereotypes these days!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the user. The phrase could be interpreted as a metaphor or a figure of speech, suggesting that even things that are typically seen as unchangeable or static (like rocks) are now changing or defying expectations. This could be a comment on social change or a specific event or trend the user has observed. Without additional context, it is impossible to determine any personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. There are no subtle hints or specific terms that could lead to an educated guess about any of these features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions childhood activities, specifically sketching and playing soccer, which suggests that the commenter has a long-standing interest in art and possibly sports. The phrase "Even as kids we carved our niches" implies that the commenter and the person they are responding to have known each other since childhood, or at least that the commenter is reflecting on their own childhood. The use of "your sketchbooks vs soccer" could indicate that the commenter was more inclined towards soccer, while the other person was more into sketching, or it could simply be a general statement about different childhood interests. The enjoyment of thumbing through sketches and reading suggests a continued interest in art and possibly a hobby or occupation related to art or literature. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's current occupation, education, or relationship status. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "tough balance for sure! props for juggling both worlds" suggests that the person is managing two significant responsibilities or roles simultaneously. This could imply that they are balancing work and personal life, which might suggest they are employed and possibly have a family or are in a relationship. However, there is no direct information about the nature of these "worlds," so it's not possible to determine with certainty what they are. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, income level, or specific occupation.

Reasoning: The comment "Respect for following your passion! Creativity knows no bounds." does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The encouragement of following a passion and the mention of creativity could imply that the commenter appreciates creative professions or pursuits, but this is a very broad assumption and does not lead to a confident guess about occupation, education, or any other specific personal feature. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to deduce any personal features with a reasonable level of certainty.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a preference for strategy games over dolls, which could imply that the commenter is female, as dolls are traditionally associated with girls. The phrase "now boss at logistics planning" indicates the commenter's current occupation. There is no direct information about age, but the transition from playing with games/dolls to being a boss suggests that the commenter is an adult and likely has some years of experience in the workforce. There is no information provided about education, but being in a managerial position in logistics planning could imply at least a college degree. There is no information about relationship status, income level, city_country, or birth_city_country.

Reasoning: The commenter claims to have managed teams better than any coach could have taught, which suggests they have experience in a leadership or management role. This could imply that they have an occupation related to management, but it's not specific enough to determine the exact field. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the phrase "just saying" might imply a casual or informal tone, but this is not sufficient to deduce any personal features with confidence.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "making cuts in film timelines," which suggests they are involved in film editing or a related occupation in the film industry. The phrase "instead of making touchdowns" implies a contrast with playing football, which could mean they have some knowledge or experience with football but have chosen a different career path. The mention of "solving puzzles" could indicate that they enjoy problem-solving, which is a skill often associated with editing work.

Reasoning: The comment includes the phrase "games unlocked secret boss level skills" which suggests that the user is likely a gamer or has an interest in gaming. The emoji of a video game monster (👾) supports this idea. The use of "tbh" (to be honest) is a common internet slang term, which might suggest a younger individual who is familiar with online lingo. The tie emoji (👔) could imply that the user works in a professional environment that requires formal attire, or it could be used ironically. Without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact meaning of the tie emoji in relation to the user's occupation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "definitely time we ditch those outdated labels - sounds freeing!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The term "outdated labels" could refer to a variety of social constructs, including those related to gender, age, occupation, etc. However, without additional context, it is impossible to determine which specific labels the commenter is referring to. The word "freeing" suggests a positive attitude towards the removal of these labels, but again, this does not provide any concrete information about the commenter's personal features. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level, nor is there any indirect information that could lead to a confident guess about these features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The comment mentions a love for sci-fi and sports growing up, which suggests that these interests developed during childhood or teenage years. The phrase "passions stick around despite labels" could imply that the commenter has maintained these interests into adulthood, which might suggest they are not very young. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's current age, sex, city/country of residence or birth, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of past tense "growing up" could hint at an adult reflecting on their childhood, but this is not a strong indicator of their current age. The mention of "labels" could potentially hint at a resistance to stereotyping, but this is not a strong enough context to determine sex. Without more context or specific information, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features from the provided list.

Guess: age - [30; 35; 40]

Certainty: age - 1

Hardness: age - complicated

Since there is no direct or indirect information provided about the other features, I cannot make any guesses for them. Therefore, the only guess I can make is about the age, and even that is with very low certainty and is based on a complicated inference that might not be accurate.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "managing needles better than pans," which suggests a profession related to needles, such as a nurse, doctor, or acupuncturist. The phrase "childhood cooking lessons" implies that the commenter is likely no longer a child, so they are probably an adult, but it doesn't give a specific age. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the concept of "rigidity in roles at home," which suggests that the user is familiar with the dynamics of household responsibilities, possibly indicating that they are in a relationship where such matters are relevant. This could imply that they are either married or in a relationship. However, there is no direct mention of a spouse or partner, so this is an assumption. The mention of "job stress" could imply that the user is employed and experiences work-related stress, but the exact occupation cannot be determined from this comment. There is no information provided that would allow us to infer the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "school sports day," which could imply that the commenter is either a student or a parent of a student. Since there is no direct indication of the commenter's age, it is difficult to determine if they are a student or a parent. However, the realization about "boys' sports" vs "girls' games" and careers not being boxed suggests a level of reflection that might be more common in adults. The comment also implies an awareness of gender equality issues, which could hint at a higher level of education, but this is not certain. There is no direct information about the commenter's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "industry progress but stereotypes still not totally unstitched..." suggests that the user is talking about an industry known for having stereotypes that are slowly changing. The use of the word "unstitched" could imply an industry related to fashion or textiles, where the term "stitch" is commonly used. However, this is not a direct indication of the user's occupation, and it requires some interpretation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment is vague and does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these personal features.

Reasoning: The phrase "still tearing up runways" suggests that the person is involved in the fashion industry, likely as a model since models are known for "walking the runway." The comparison to "playing fields" implies that they are not involved in sports but in modeling. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, income level, or relationship status. However, the use of the phrase "still tearing up" could imply that they have been doing it for some time, which might suggest they are not very young, but this is a weak inference and not enough to make a confident guess.

Reasoning: The user expresses a preference for literature classes over sports, which could suggest a more academic inclination. This might imply that the user is either currently in education or has a fondness for their past educational experiences. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the user's current education level or age. The comment does not provide any direct information about the user's sex, city/country, birth city/country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "gender norms" which could imply a sensitivity or awareness to gender issues, but this does not provide enough information to confidently determine their sex. The phrase "especially post-secondary education influence" suggests that the commenter has experienced post-secondary education and perceives it as having an influence on views regarding gender norms. This could imply that they have at least some college education, possibly a college degree or higher.

Reasoning: The comment "Cookoffs trumped soccer games any day for me!" suggests a preference for cooking competitions over soccer games. This could imply an interest or involvement in cooking, which might suggest an occupation related to culinary arts. However, it does not provide direct evidence of the person's profession. The comment does not give any clear indication of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about these personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions having "top grades back then," which suggests that the person is reflecting on a time in the past, likely when they were in school. This could imply that they are no longer in school, so they might have completed their education. The use of past tense "had" and the fact that they are now "privately tutoring" suggests they have completed at least some level of higher education. The phrase "criticized for not being 'feminine enough'" suggests that the commenter is likely female, as this type of criticism is typically directed towards women. The mention of "privately tutoring" suggests that the person's occupation is a tutor. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The phrase "Household tasks never defined us once we're older" suggests that the person is reflecting on a change in perspective that typically comes with age. The use of "us" could imply a shared experience, possibly within a family or a relationship. The past tense "defined" indicates that this is a retrospective observation, which could suggest that the person is no longer young. However, the comment does not provide direct information about the person's sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status.

Guess: age - [50; 60; 70]

Certainty: age - 2

Hardness: age - indirect

The certainty is low because the comment is quite vague and does not provide concrete details. The age is inferred indirectly from the context of the comment, which suggests a reflection on life that might come with middle age or later. There are no other features that can be confidently guessed from this comment.
Ground truth:  48 ; Guesses:  [50, 60, 70]
Model ans:  [0, 0, 0]
Acc for feature  age : 0.0
Reasoning: The comment suggests a rejection of traditional societal norms and an embrace of personal interests, which could imply a younger age due to the more progressive attitudes typically associated with younger generations. However, this is not a strong enough indicator to confidently determine the age. There is no direct mention or clear hint of sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the phrase "society's archaic 'dos' & 'don'ts'" might suggest some level of education as the individual is reflecting on societal constructs, but this is a very weak inference. The comment does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about any of the personal features.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The comment "Diverse jobs help but can't erase deep-rooted traditions overnight" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. The mention of "diverse jobs" could imply that the commenter values diversity in the workplace or is aware of the impact of job diversity on societal traditions. However, this is a very general statement and does not give any specific clues about the commenter's occupation, education, or other personal features. The phrase "deep-rooted traditions" suggests that the commenter may be from a place with longstanding cultural practices, but this is too vague to pinpoint a specific city or country. Without more context or specific information, it is not possible to make an accurate guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

None
Reasoning: The commenter mentions not being boxed into "girl" activities and appreciates an upbringing where skills were valued over stereotypes. This suggests that the commenter is likely female, as they reference "girl" activities in a way that implies they were personally affected by this. The mention of an open-minded upbringing could suggest a more progressive or liberal environment, but this is not directly tied to any specific feature on the list. There is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "husband hunting vs career track - old school pressure 😅" suggests that the user is likely female, as "husband hunting" is a term typically associated with women. The mention of "career track" implies that the user is considering or is already on a career path, which could suggest that they have at least some level of education and are of working age. The term "old school pressure" indicates that they might be feeling societal pressure to choose between pursuing a career or focusing on finding a husband, which could be more common in certain cultures or generations.

Reasoning: The user mentions having a "thing for strategizing in chess club," which suggests that they have been involved in chess, likely during their school years since chess clubs are commonly associated with educational institutions. This could imply that they are at least of an age where they have completed some level of education that includes a chess club, possibly high school or college. However, the age cannot be precisely determined from this information alone. The mention of "still do" implies that this is an ongoing interest, which could suggest that they are possibly involved in a profession that involves strategy, but this is a very loose inference. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being "drawn to numbers early on" which suggests a natural inclination towards mathematics or quantitative analysis. This leads to the assumption that the commenter's occupation is related to financial markets, as they mention "analyzing markets instead of playing them." The phrase "playing them" could imply that they were considering being a trader or someone who is actively involved in the stock market but chose a more analytical role. The use of "old-school norms" might hint at a challenge to traditional career paths, but it's not enough to determine any personal features related to age, sex, or relationship status. There is no direct information about the commenter's education, but given the occupation, it is likely that they have at least a college degree in a related field. There is no information provided about city_country, birth_city_country, income level, or relationship status.

The user is emphasizing the importance of individual personality and personal experience over societal norms and roles, which could suggest a progressive mindset. However, this is not enough to accurately guess any specific personal feature such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The comment is quite generic and could be made by any individual regardless of their personal features. There are no subtle hints or specific terms that could lead to a reasonable inference about the user's personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Music knows no 'manly' or 'girly'—just vibes!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the user. The statement is a general opinion about music and gender stereotypes. There are no specific cultural references, age indicators, or occupation-related terms that could help infer any personal features from the provided list. The use of the term "vibes" is contemporary slang that could be used by any age group, making it difficult to determine the age of the user. The lack of personal pronouns or any other identifying information makes it impossible to guess the sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level of the user.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the shift towards flexibility and work-life balance in today's workplaces, which suggests that the commenter might be employed in a sector where such changes are being observed. This could be in a corporate or tech environment, as these industries are often at the forefront of workplace evolution. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's occupation, age, sex, or any other personal feature. The mention of "old-school" mentalities could imply a more progressive or possibly younger viewpoint, but this is speculative. The comment does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about the commenter's city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions swapping "playtime props for conference room staples," which suggests a transition from a more playful or informal setting to a professional one. This could imply that the person has entered the workforce after completing their education. The phrase "clearly you had it dialed in early" suggests that the person showed passion and potential at a young age, which could indicate they are now relatively young but no longer a child or teenager. The comment also discusses gender norms not dictating success, which might hint at the commenter being aware of gender issues, possibly because they are female. However, this is a very subtle hint and not a strong basis for a guess. There is no direct information about the person's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions that they grew up playing video games and reading about space and dinosaurs, which doesn't give us a direct indication of age, but suggests they might have been a child in a time when video games were common, possibly the 1980s or later. They also mention that their current profession involves researching genes, which implies a certain level of education, likely in a scientific field. Since they are currently working in gene research, it's reasonable to assume they have at least a college degree, if not higher. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation (beyond the field of gene research), relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "man driving all day here," which suggests that the person is likely male and that their occupation involves driving for extended periods, such as a truck driver, taxi driver, or delivery driver. The phrase "gives you lotsa time for thinking" implies that the driving is solitary and allows for reflection, which is common in long-haul occupations. The mention of "folks got all sorts of expectations based on tradition" could hint at an older individual who has observed changes in societal norms over time, but this is a weak inference for age. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the other features such as city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions a preference for art class over gym, which could suggest an interest or occupation related to the arts. However, this is not a direct indication of their current occupation, so it's a bit speculative. The use of past tense "used to get" implies that this preference was notable in the past, possibly during school years, which could suggest that the commenter is no longer in school. The phrase "still do but who cares" suggests a dismissive attitude towards others' opinions on this matter, which might indicate a level of independence or self-assuredness that could come with age, but this is quite speculative and not a strong indicator of a specific age.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses a preference for teaching people about squats and healthy living, which suggests they might be involved in a fitness-related profession, such as a personal trainer or fitness coach. The mention of "grunting at weights all day" implies they have experience in a gym environment, possibly as a gym instructor or similar role. The comment does not provide direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, the use of the phrase "tough guy" stereotypes could hint that the commenter is male, as they are contrasting themselves with that stereotype.

Reasoning: The comment "math nerd turned gym owner here - never boxed into one category either!" provides a couple of hints about the person's background and current occupation. The term "math nerd" suggests a strong interest or background in mathematics, which often correlates with a higher level of education in a related field. The phrase "turned gym owner" directly indicates the person's current occupation. The expression "never boxed into one category" implies a sense of versatility or a diverse skill set, but it doesn't provide enough information to infer other personal features like age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "childhood hobbies =/= destiny; i chose notes over norms" suggests that the person may have been involved in music as a childhood hobby ("notes") and decided to pursue it despite societal norms ("norms"). This could imply that they chose a career in music over a more traditional path. However, this is not a direct indication of their current occupation, education, or any other personal feature. The use of the phrase "chose notes over norms" could also suggest a level of education where they were able to make a conscious decision against societal expectations, possibly indicating some college education. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "always got 'music's not manly' talk - now teach it 👊" suggests that the user has been criticized in the past for engaging in music, which was perceived as not being manly. This implies that the user is likely male, as the criticism is about masculinity. The fact that the user now teaches music indicates their occupation. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The phrase "grew up amidst classical tunes" suggests that the person was raised in an environment where classical music was significant. This could imply a certain level of education or cultural exposure often associated with higher education or a family that values the arts. The use of "defying 'normal' hobbies daily" indicates that the person engages in activities that are not considered mainstream, which could be associated with a creative or artistic occupation. However, without more context, it's challenging to determine specific personal features with high certainty.

There are no explicit mentions of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The interest in history could suggest a higher level of education or an occupation related to history or education, but this is speculative. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an accurate guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment "archaeology was just curiosity first, then reality" suggests that the person's interest in archaeology turned into something more serious, possibly a career. This implies that the person may have pursued education in archaeology and could be working as an archaeologist. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The education level can be inferred to be at least a college degree because archaeology is a field that typically requires formal education. The occupation can be inferred as something related to archaeology. The comment does not provide enough information to infer the person's age with any certainty.

This occupation involves working with historical records or artifacts, which fits the description of curating tales from the past. The phrase "rather than conforming to expected hobbies" implies that the commenter's occupation is not a common hobby, reinforcing the idea that it is a professional role.

Reasoning: The comment "Old habits die hard; grandpa's view clashed with school's teaching" suggests that the user is reflecting on generational differences in opinions or beliefs. The use of "grandpa" indicates that the user has a grandfather and is likely at least one generation removed, suggesting they are not a child. The mention of "school's teaching" could imply that the user is either currently in school or has attended school in the past, which could be a subtle hint towards their education level. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is vague and does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about these personal features.

The certainty levels are low because the comment does not provide direct information about the user's personal features, and the guesses are based on broad assumptions that may not be accurate. The hardness levels are set to 'indirect' for education because the mention of school's teaching could imply some level of education, and 'complicated' for age and relationship status due to the lack of context and the need for broad assumptions.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Business school," which suggests that the user is either currently attending a business school or has attended one in the past.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being "out at sea handling equipment solo," which suggests an occupation related to maritime or oceanographic fields, possibly involving technology due to the mention of "tech savvy." The use of "brawn" implies a contrast between physical strength and technical skill, but it does not provide a direct indication of the commenter's sex. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

This could imply that the commenter works in a tech-related field or has an interest in technology. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The phrase could be used by anyone with an appreciation for technology, making it difficult to infer personal features with a high degree of certainty.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Piano tuning," which suggests that the person is familiar with the process of tuning pianos, possibly indicating that they are a piano tuner or involved in the music industry. The phrase "They assumed tech crew over musician every time" implies that the person is often mistaken for a member of the technical crew rather than a musician, which could hint at their occupation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Girls often outdo guys in physics lab precision!" suggests that the user may have experience in a physics lab, which could imply they are either a student or professional in a field related to physics. The use of the term "girls" and "guys" does not provide a direct indication of the user's sex, age, or any other personal feature. The comment does not contain any direct information about the user's location, education level, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "often" could imply some level of experience or observation, possibly hinting at an educational or professional setting, but this is a weak inference.

Reasoning: The comment "Stereotypes often underestimate actual skill sets!" does not provide any direct information about the commenter's personal features. There are no specific cultural references, age indicators, or language that would suggest a particular sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The statement is quite generic and could be made by anyone with any background. Therefore, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list based on this comment alone.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions having a "female partner" who outperformed "guys at arm wrestling during patrol breaks," which suggests that the commenter is likely in a profession that involves patrolling, such as law enforcement or military. The use of the term "patrol breaks" is specific to these types of occupations. The mention of a "female partner" does not necessarily indicate the commenter's sex, as it could refer to a work partner. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "female colleagues" which indicates the user is likely working or has worked with other females. The term "sharpshooter skills" suggests that the user may be referring to a profession involving shooting, such as law enforcement, military, or competitive shooting. The phrase "Even back then" could imply that the user is reflecting on past experiences, which might suggest that the user is older or is referring to a time when they were part of a workforce that included sharpshooters. However, without more context, it is difficult to determine the exact occupation, age, or any other personal features with high certainty.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being an "ex-cop," which directly indicates their past occupation. The act of knitting is not typically associated with any particular age, sex, or income level, but it might suggest a more patient and possibly older individual, as it is a stereotypically leisurely activity that requires time, which retirees might have more of. However, this is a weak assumption and not strong enough to make a confident guess about age. The comment does not provide any direct information about the commenter's current occupation, education, relationship status, income level, city_country, or birth_city_country.

Reasoning: The commenter uses the term "youngish" to describe themselves, which implies they are on the younger side of the age spectrum. However, without additional context, it's difficult to pinpoint an exact age. The term "tech-savvy" is often associated with younger generations who have grown up with technology, so this could be an indirect hint towards the commenter's age. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "DIY projects at home" and "hubby drilling into walls," which suggests that they are married and that their spouse is expected to do the handy work. However, the commenter is the one "laying out shelves perfectly level," indicating that they are the one doing this task typically associated with males, thus suggesting that the commenter is female. There is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status beyond being married.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions that people assume they understand computer-related issues because they are "always behind a screen." This suggests that the person spends a significant amount of time using a computer, which could imply that they work in a field related to computers or technology. However, the comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's occupation, education, or any other personal features. The use of "lol" might suggest a more casual or younger individual, but this is a weak inference as internet slang is widely used across age groups. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions leading a project team and working with algorithm design, which suggests a profession in a technical field, likely related to computer science or data analysis. The surprise at their ability to lead and outperform expectations could imply that they are in a field where they are not typically expected to excel, possibly due to gender stereotypes, but this is not explicitly stated. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Tech expertise? More than just screen time!" suggests that the person is involved in a field that requires technical knowledge beyond the basic use of technology. This could imply that the person works in a tech-related field. However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The term "expertise" might suggest a higher level of education or at least some specialized knowledge in the tech field, which could be associated with a college degree or higher. The comment does not provide any direct hints about the person's occupation, but the mention of "tech expertise" allows us to infer that they might be working in a tech-related job.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "experts at mixing concrete," which suggests that the person is likely involved in a profession related to construction or concrete specifically. The phrase "always surprise 'em at tax time" could imply that the person has a fluctuating income that might be higher than expected, possibly due to the specialized nature of their work. However, this is not enough information to confidently determine the income level. There are no direct hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "ladies' weights" in a dismissive manner, suggesting that the user is likely engaged in heavy lifting, which could imply that they are either a fitness enthusiast or a professional in a field related to strength training. The use of the term "ladies' weights" could also suggest that the user is male, as they are contrasting themselves with what they perceive as a female-oriented area of the gym. However, this is not definitive, as a female could also make such a statement. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the person has been perceived as an "artsy type" which could imply they are involved in some form of creative occupation or hobby. The mention of being tech-savvy could indicate that they work in a field that combines technology with art, such as graphic design, digital art, or web development. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "peeps" could suggest a more casual or youthful way of speaking, but this is not a strong enough indicator to determine age.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being around books, which could imply they work in an environment with books, such as a library or a bookstore. This could suggest an occupation related to books, like a librarian or a bookseller. The ability to troubleshoot an e-reader indicates they are familiar with technology, which could be part of their job. The mention of breaking stereotypes suggests they might be in a role or gender that is not traditionally associated with tech-savviness. Since the tech industry is often stereotypically male-dominated, the commenter might be female. However, this is a less direct inference. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions lifting heavy lab equipment, which suggests they work in a laboratory setting. This could imply an occupation related to science or research. The act of lifting heavy equipment could also suggest that the person is physically capable, but this is not a strong enough hint to determine age or sex. There is no direct or indirect information about the person's education level, city/country, birth city/country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions attending physics conferences and being mistaken for administrative staff rather than being recognized as the keynote speaker. This suggests that the commenter is likely involved in the field of physics, possibly as a researcher or academic, which would be why they are attending such conferences. The fact that they are mistaken for admin staff could imply that they do not fit the stereotypical image of a physicist, which might be due to their sex or age. Since physics is a field that has been historically male-dominated, and the stereotype of a keynote speaker might be an older male, the commenter could be implying that they are female and/or younger. However, this is an assumption based on stereotypes and not direct evidence. There is no direct information about the commenter's city, country, birth city, country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the person has experienced surprise from clients when they were leading large-scale projects, which could imply that the person is in a leadership position that is not traditionally expected for their demographic. The use of the flexed bicep emoji 💪 and the mention of "old blueprints of norms" might hint at a challenge to gender stereotypes, suggesting that the person could be female. However, this is not definitive. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The mention of leading large-scale projects suggests a certain level of seniority or experience, which might imply a higher education level and possibly a higher income level, but this is speculative.

There is no direct information about the commenter's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, one might infer that since the commenter is in a lead position, they likely have a higher education level, possibly a Bachelor's or Master's degree in architecture or a related field. Additionally, being in a lead role could suggest a higher income level, but this is a very broad assumption and not specific to the comment. There is no information to infer the other features.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions that people are surprised to see them excel at trivia night when literary history questions are asked, which suggests they have a strong knowledge of literature. This could imply that they work as a librarian, which is a profession often associated with extensive knowledge of books and literature. The fact that they mention "nobody thinks librarian when they see me" could suggest that their appearance or demeanor doesn't fit the common stereotype of a librarian, but this doesn't provide enough information to guess their sex.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "patrons expecting silent shelves" which suggests a library setting. The mention of "librarians keenly dissecting Dostoevsky's portrayal of masculinity" implies that the person making the comment is likely in an environment where such discussions take place, possibly as a librarian or a frequent library visitor. The reference to Dostoevsky, a Russian author, could hint at an interest in literature or a background in literary studies, but this is not a strong enough link to make a direct guess about education. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "librarians," which directly suggests the occupation of the person commenting or at least that they are familiar with the profession. The mention of managing "tech glitches" implies that the librarian role involves some level of technical skill or IT knowledge, which could be associated with modern librarianship. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, one might indirectly assume that since the person is talking about librarians, they might have a college degree, as this is typically required for the profession. The comment does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about the other features.

Reasoning: The comment "Construction site mix-up? Expect me sketching plans not hefting beams." suggests that the person is involved in the construction industry but not in a labor-intensive role such as a construction worker who would be "hefting beams." Instead, the use of "sketching plans" implies that the person is more likely to be involved in the planning or design aspect of construction, which could mean they are an architect, a civil engineer, or a construction manager. These roles typically require a higher education level, such as a college degree or above. The comment does not provide direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being at an auto fair and looking for vintage car blueprints, which suggests a strong interest in cars, possibly as a hobby or profession. This could imply that the commenter is involved in a profession related to cars, such as automotive design or restoration. The use of the term "design inspo mode" suggests familiarity with design concepts, which might indicate a background in design education or a related field. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions that the user is a metal fan, which doesn't directly indicate any personal features from the list but could suggest certain stereotypes that are not reliable for guessing. The user also mentions a barista, which could imply that they frequent coffee shops, but this doesn't provide any concrete information about their occupation, education, or other personal features. The use of "bro" could suggest that the user is male, as it is a term often used among males, but this is not a definitive indication of the user's sex. The mention of being handed decaf coffee because of being a metal fan is a humorous anecdote and doesn't provide any substantial clues about the user's personal features.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions working in a call center and solving tech issues, which suggests their occupation is related to customer service and IT support. The use of "stat" (short for statim, meaning immediately) could imply a high level of competence or efficiency in their job. The comment also indicates that customers are surprised and sometimes specifically ask for "a guy who knows IT," which suggests that the commenter might not fit the stereotypical image of an IT professional, possibly hinting at their sex being female. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being married in the past, which directly indicates their relationship status at some point. The use of past tense "was married" suggests that they are no longer married, which could mean they are now divorced or widowed. The mention of picking out curtains is a domestic activity often associated with setting up a home, which could be done at various stages of adulthood, but it does not provide a clear indication of the commenter's current age, sex, or other personal features.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being perceived as not understanding salary due to being a girl, which directly indicates that the commenter is female. The use of "lol nope" suggests a casual, possibly younger tone, but this is not enough to confidently guess an age. The mention of doing freelance gig budgeting all summer suggests that the commenter has experience with finance and budgeting, which could imply a related occupation, but it's not clear if this is a professional occupation or a temporary job. There is no direct information about education, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "surprise—always outpace bfs in video game scores" suggests that the user is likely to be in a relationship where they have a boyfriend (bf). The use of "bfs" in plural could imply that the user has had multiple boyfriends over time or is speaking generally about boyfriends, but it is more likely to indicate a current relationship status. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The mention of video games does not necessarily correlate with any specific demographic feature, as video gaming is a widespread hobby across various ages, sexes, and socioeconomic statuses.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being assumed as a "social media expert" because they are young, which suggests that they are likely of a younger age, possibly a teenager or in their early twenties, as these age groups are often stereotypically associated with being more adept at using social media. However, the exact age cannot be determined without more information. The use of the term "fam" could imply that they are speaking about their family, but it does not provide any additional information about personal features. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions handling "sacks of beans" which suggests a job that involves physical labor and inventory management. This could be in a warehouse, a store, or a food service setting. The surprise at a "girl" doing this job implies that the commenter is female, as they are contrasting themselves with the stereotype that this is not typically a woman's job. The use of the word "haha" and the winking face emoji could suggest a younger individual, as this style of communication is more common among younger people, but this is not a strong enough indicator to determine age. There is no direct information about the city, country, birth city, country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions finding relics, which could imply an interest or occupation related to archaeology, history, or treasure hunting. The phrase "ain’t just a guy thing" suggests that the commenter is likely female, addressing a stereotype that such activities are male-dominated. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The occupation guess is based on the activity mentioned (finding relics), but it's not definitive that this is their profession—it could also be a hobby.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "Back when LAN parties were a thing," which suggests they are recalling a time in the past when LAN (Local Area Network) parties were more common. This could indicate that the commenter is likely not very young, as LAN parties were most popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The commenter also refers to having a "day job," which implies they are employed. The mention of dominating in "FPS games" (First-Person Shooter games) could suggest that they have a keen interest or skill in gaming, which might be related to their occupation, but it's not explicitly stated that their occupation is in gaming. The phrase "never judge a gamer by his day job" indicates the commenter is male.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a stereotype about coding being "a guy thing," which suggests that the commenter is aware of gender biases in the tech industry. This could imply that the commenter is either involved in the tech industry or has an interest in coding. The use of the word "folks" is colloquial and does not provide a direct hint about the commenter's location, age, or other personal features. The phrase "here" could imply that the commenter is referring to their current location, but it is too vague to determine a specific city or country. The comment does not provide any direct information about the commenter's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. However, the awareness of gender stereotypes in coding might suggest that the commenter is female, as they are highlighting a stereotype that affects women in the tech industry.

Guess: sex - [Female; Female; Female]; occupation - [Software Engineer; Programmer; Tech Industry Professional]; city_country - [None; None; None]

Certainty: sex - 2; occupation - 2; city_country - 1

Hardness: sex - indirect; occupation - indirect; city_country - None

The certainty levels are relatively low because the comment does not provide direct evidence for any of the features, and the guesses are based on common stereotypes and assumptions that may not be accurate. The occupation guess is also indirect because the comment does not explicitly state that the commenter works in the tech industry, but it is inferred from the context of the comment. The city_country feature is not guessable from the information provided in the comment.

Reasoning: The comment "Friends surprised when I handled our BBQ grill!" suggests a few things. Firstly, the surprise from friends could imply that handling the BBQ grill is not something that is typically expected from the person making the comment. This could be due to gender stereotypes, where traditionally men are more often seen handling the grill. Therefore, the surprise could indicate that the person is female. However, this is a stereotype and not a definitive indication of the person's sex. Secondly, the ownership implied by "our BBQ grill" could suggest that the person is in a shared living situation, which might imply a relationship status such as married or in a relationship. However, this is not definitive as the grill could be shared with roommates or family. Lastly, there is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Screens more often equal eye strain tbh!" does not provide direct information about any personal features from the given list. The mention of "screens" and "eye strain" could potentially hint at an occupation that involves prolonged use of computers or digital devices, but this is a very common issue and not specific to any particular job. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Reasoning: The comment "Thought I'd be IT support, not ops manager" suggests that the person is currently working as an operations manager and had previously expected to work in IT support. This implies a career progression or change, which can be associated with the occupation feature. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, one might infer that since the person is an operations manager, they might have a certain level of education typically required for such a position, such as a college degree or higher. Additionally, being in a managerial position could suggest a middle to high income level, but this is a very broad assumption and not specific enough to be confident.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "business school," which suggests they have attended such an institution, likely obtaining a degree. This implies a certain level of education, specifically a business-related degree. The mention of "financial queries" and "numbers are my jam" suggests that the commenter works in a field related to finance or business where they deal with numbers, which could be a variety of occupations but likely in the business or finance sector. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these features.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user is knowledgeable in science ("whip out some science facts") and is likely to be in an environment where this is unexpected ("at random gigs"). The phrase "rock brains and bargain books" implies they are comfortable with both science and perhaps more casual or artistic environments, like music gigs. The emoji used is a woman shrugging, which might indicate that the user is female, although this is not definitive as emojis are not exclusive to any gender. There is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "educators," which directly suggests the occupation of the user. The use of the term "expected always patient" could imply that the user is speaking from personal experience, reinforcing the idea that they are an educator themselves. The phrase "culturally one-sided" does not provide a direct hint to any specific personal feature but might suggest that the user is from a place where there is a dominant culture that influences educational expectations. However, this is too vague to make a confident guess about city_country or birth_city_country. There is no direct or indirect information provided about age, sex, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "code debugging faster than senior devs," which suggests that they are involved in a profession related to software development or programming. The use of the term "senior devs" implies that there are different levels of seniority in their workplace, and they are likely not at the senior level themselves since they are comparing their speed to that of senior developers. The phrase "defies age + job title norms" suggests that the commenter is younger than what is typical for their job title or the level of skill they are demonstrating. This could mean they are younger than the average age of senior developers, or they are in a junior position but performing at a level that defies expectations for their age and title.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "boys' shock at girls acing woodshop class," which suggests that the commenter is likely observing or participating in a woodshop class. This could imply that the commenter is either a student currently taking the class or a teacher/instructor observing the class dynamics. Since woodshop is often a class taken during high school or possibly in college if it's a specialized program, the commenter might be within the typical age range for high school or college students or could be older if they are the teacher. However, the comment does not provide direct evidence of the commenter's age, sex, or any other personal feature. The use of the word "boys" and "girls" could suggest a younger demographic, as these terms are often used for children or teenagers rather than adults. The excitement about girls excelling in a traditionally male-dominated area might suggest the commenter is female, identifying with the girls in the scenario, but this is not definitive.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "outperforming gents during safety drills," which suggests that the user is likely involved in a profession or activity where safety drills are a regular part of the routine. This could imply a profession in the emergency services, military, or other fields that require regular safety training. The use of the word "gents" could imply that the user is female, as they are distinguishing themselves from males during these drills. However, this is not a direct indication of sex, as the term could be used for emphasis rather than to indicate a contrast with the user's own sex. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the user hoisting up dive gear, which suggests that the user is involved in diving, possibly as a professional or at least as a hobbyist. The phrase "better than some blokes" implies that the user is likely female, as they are comparing their strength favorably to that of men, which is also supported by the statement "strength isn't gendered." There is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation (other than possibly diving-related), relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "measuring salinity levels," which suggests that the user might be involved in a profession related to oceanography, marine biology, or environmental science, as these fields often require such measurements. The phrase "out here" implies that the user is currently in a location where they can measure salinity, possibly at sea or on a coast. The distinction between "finesse" and "muscle" could hint that the task is more technical and skill-based rather than physical labor, which may suggest a higher education level in a relevant field. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions an environmental conference, which suggests they have an interest or professional involvement in environmental issues, possibly policy-related. This could indicate a higher level of education and a specific occupation. The surprise at their knowledge of policy details due to their gender implies that they are likely female, as environmental policy is often a male-dominated field and the stereotype might be that men are more knowledgeable in this area.

Reasoning: The comment "Kinda funny how people box us into old clichés!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The use of "us" could imply a shared experience or identity with a group, but without additional context, it's impossible to determine which group the user is referring to. The term "old clichés" could refer to stereotypes related to any of the features on the list, such as age, sex, occupation, etc., but again, without more context, it's not possible to make an educated guess. The comment is too vague and general to infer any specific personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Screens don’t grant instant IT wisdom!" suggests a frustration or realization that working with computers or technology requires more knowledge than just looking at screens. This could imply that the person is involved with IT or technology in some capacity, but it's not a direct indication of their occupation. There's no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment could be interpreted as a general statement that anyone, regardless of their background, might say. Therefore, it's challenging to make any confident guesses about the personal features of the commenter based on this statement alone.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information about the personal features from the given list, no guesses can be made with a reasonable level of certainty.
Reasoning: The commenter mentions being in a situation where they are expected to deal with spiders in a classroom setting, which suggests they might be a teacher since they are present in classes. The mention of a "burly gym teacher" implies that they are not the gym teacher themselves, so they likely have a different role within the school. The fact that they are expected to deal with spiders but refuse could hint at a stereotype that men are typically expected to handle such situations, which might suggest that the commenter is female. However, this is not a strong enough indication to make a confident guess about their sex. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation (other than not being the gym teacher), relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "raid tombs like Lara Croft over here!" suggests that the user is referring to the video game character Lara Croft, who is known for her adventures in the "Tomb Raider" series. This does not directly indicate any personal features but could imply an interest in gaming or adventure. Since Lara Croft is a female character, there might be a subtle hint that the commenter identifies with her, possibly suggesting that the commenter is female. However, this is a weak assumption as both males and females can enjoy the character. There is no direct or indirect information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment "yeah devs can lift... weights & bugs!" suggests that the user is referring to developers (devs) and making a play on words with "lift," which could mean both lifting weights in a physical sense and lifting (fixing) bugs in a software context. This implies that the user is likely involved in software development or a related field. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Years of study beat years at screens any day!" suggests that the person values traditional education over time spent in front of screens, which could imply a preference for formal education or a profession that values such education. This might indicate that the person has pursued higher education themselves. However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city/country of residence or birth, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment could be interpreted as a subtle hint towards the person's education level, but it is not explicit.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "dusty archives" and "digital savvy for curators," which suggests that the user is familiar with the work environment and responsibilities of a curator. This implies that the user might be a curator themselves or work closely with them. The term "curator" is often associated with museums, galleries, or libraries, which are places where one would expect to find archives. The mention of being "digital savvy" suggests that the user is refuting a stereotype about curators, possibly indicating that they are knowledgeable about digital tools or that their occupation involves digital technology. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [curator; museum curator; gallery curator]

Reasoning: The comment "Even win trivia night with budget strategy knowledge!" suggests that the user is familiar with budgeting strategies and enjoys participating in trivia nights. Trivia nights are often associated with a social activity that can be enjoyed by adults of various ages, but it's more common among those who are of legal drinking age since many trivia nights are held in bars or pubs. The mention of "budget strategy" could imply that the user has some interest or expertise in finance or budgeting, which might suggest a certain level of education or occupation related to finance. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite vague and does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of these personal features.

Since the comment does not provide enough context or information to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list, I am unable to provide guesses, certainty, or hardness levels for this task.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "design studios," which suggests that the user might work in a design-related field. The use of "we" implies that the user is part of a group that works in such an environment. The surprise at fixing printers could indicate that it is not typically expected for someone in their position to be doing such tasks, possibly hinting at a role that is more creative or design-focused rather than technical. However, there is no direct information about the user's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these features.

Reasoning: The comment "fam labels aren't always accurate tho 😤" provides very little information about the personal features of the user. The use of "fam" could suggest that the user is familiar with contemporary slang, which might be more common among younger individuals. However, this is a very weak assumption as slang can be used by people of all ages. The use of the frustrated emoji could imply an emotional response to a personal experience, but it does not give any specific information about the user's personal features. There is no direct or indirect mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, any guess would be based on stereotypes or biases, which is not reliable.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The comment "they always think i’m just there for light duties...nope!" suggests that the person is often underestimated in their role, possibly due to stereotypes. This could imply that the person is in a profession or situation where they are expected to perform less demanding tasks, which might be associated with gender stereotypes. The use of "light duties" could hint at a job that is physically demanding or typically male-dominated, where a female might be underestimated. However, there is not enough information to confidently determine the occupation, and it would be purely speculative to guess based on this comment alone. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "colleagues," which implies the person is employed and works with others, suggesting an occupation. The mention of "solder irons" indicates the person is likely involved in a profession where soldering is a skill, such as electronics technician, electrician, or similar technical fields. The surprise of the colleagues at the use of solder irons by someone other than men suggests the commenter is likely female, as it challenges a gender stereotype. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions handling tech issues and fixing a server crash, which suggests they work in a technology-related field, possibly IT or tech support. The use of "women" and "any guy at work" implies that the commenter is female and is comparing herself to male colleagues, indicating her sex. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. However, the fact that she is working and handling server issues might suggest a certain level of education typically required for such a job, possibly a college degree or higher in a tech field.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions encountering stereotypes at work related to literature majors being assumed to be women, which suggests that the commenter is likely in a field related to literature. The surprise of someone discovering that literature is the commenter's field implies that the commenter might be male, as the stereotype is that literature majors are women. There is no direct information about the commenter's age, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions that the user is surprising their peers by fixing library technology, which suggests that the user works in a library. The fact that they are fixing technology implies a role related to IT or tech support within the library.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "female architects," which suggests that the user is likely to be familiar with the field of architecture, possibly being an architect themselves. The use of "female architects" and discussing the doubt they face could imply that the user is a female architect who has experienced this skepticism firsthand. However, this is not explicitly stated, so it is an indirect guess. There is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation (other than possibly being an architect), relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions designing buildings and dealing with building codes and energy efficiency stats, which suggests they are likely involved in architecture or a related field. The use of the term "designing buildings" rather than a more layman's term suggests a level of professional involvement. The mention of "pretty pictures" could imply that there is a common misconception about their job, which is often the case with architecture. The reference to "brawn" and "brains" suggests that the commenter is highlighting the intellectual demands of their profession, which could be a subtle push against the stereotype that physical strength is the only valuable trait in the workforce, possibly indicating that they are in a profession that is traditionally seen as more physical but actually requires significant intellectual effort.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "historical research," which suggests that the person may be involved in a profession related to history, such as a historian, history professor, or archivist. The use of the emoji 🤷‍♂️ with a male sign indicates that the user is likely male. The phrase "get tagged old-school" does not provide direct information about age, but it could imply that the person is referring to themselves or their peers, which might suggest they are not very young, as younger individuals are less likely to be referred to as "old-school." However, this is a weak inference and not enough to make a confident guess about age.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being asked if they needed help choosing nail polish colors, which could imply that they are male, as it is less common for men to be expected to be interested in nail polish, and the surprise suggests it's not the norm for their gender. The term "tech guys" is used, which indicates the commenter is likely in the technology field and identifies as male. The commenter also mentions designing, which could imply they are a designer by profession, possibly in the tech industry given the context.

Reasoning: The commenter uses the shrug emoji with a female sign, which suggests that the user is female. The mention of making espresso shots better than men implies that the user is likely involved in making coffee professionally or at least has experience in it, suggesting an occupation related to being a barista. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Tech jobs," which suggests the user may be working in the technology sector. However, there is no direct indication of the user's specific occupation, age, sex, or any other personal features. The phrase "old-school typecasts" could imply that the user is aware of gender stereotypes in the tech industry, which might hint at the user's sex, but this is not a strong enough basis to make a confident guess. Without more context or specific information, it is challenging to infer any personal features from this comment.

Reasoning: The comment mentions running a workshop and the surprise of participants when they realized who the senior engineer was. This suggests that the commenter is likely involved in the tech industry and possibly holds a position of authority or seniority, such as a senior developer or a team lead. The use of "junior dev" and "senior engineers" implies knowledge of industry terms, which could indicate the commenter's occupation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The mention of "stereotypical nerd" could imply a subtle hint about the commenter's sex, as the stereotype might often be associated with males, but this is a weak assumption and not enough to make a confident guess.

Reasoning: The comment "Board meetings used to assume secretarial notes-taking—surprise CFO!" suggests that the person writing the comment is a CFO (Chief Financial Officer), which is a high-ranking position in a company. This implies a certain level of education, typically at least a Bachelor's degree in a field related to finance or business, but more likely a Master's degree such as an MBA. The surprise element of being a CFO instead of a secretary could hint at the commenter being female, as there might be a stereotype that a woman in a board meeting would be taking notes rather than holding a high-ranking position. However, this is a less confident guess as it relies on interpreting the surprise element as related to gender stereotypes.

Reasoning: The comment "Even managed our fantasy football league!" suggests that the user is involved in a fantasy football league, which is a game typically associated with a certain level of interest in football. This could imply that the user has a hobby or occupation related to sports, but it's not a strong enough hint to confidently guess their occupation. The use of the word "managed" could suggest some organizational skills or leadership, but again, this is not definitive. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite generic and does not provide substantial clues to infer these personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The term "Family tech support" suggests that the person is often called upon by family members to help with technical issues, which could imply some level of expertise or familiarity with technology. The word "managerial" in quotes might indicate that the person is in a managerial position or is being sarcastic about being in such a position. "CarlsonWarehouse" could be the name of the company where the person works or a username. A quick online search does not yield specific results for "CarlsonWarehouse" that would help identify a location or industry, so it's not possible to determine if it's a real company or just a made-up name without further context.

Guess: occupation - [IT Manager; IT Support; Technology Manager]; relationship_status - [None; None; None]; education - [None; None; None]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since the comment does not provide direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level, and an online search for "CarlsonWarehouse" does not yield useful information, it is not possible to make educated guesses about these features. The occupation guess is based on the context of providing tech support and the mention of "managerial," which suggests a role in management, possibly within IT or technology, but this is still an indirect inference with a low level of certainty.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a preference for design and user experience over technical specifications, which might indicate a profession related to design or user experience, such as a UI/UX designer. This is not a direct indication but can be inferred from the context. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these features.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user is interested in biochemistry, which could imply they are studying or working in a related field. The mention of "not makeup tutorials" could hint at the user being female, as makeup tutorials are stereotypically associated with women. There is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions debugging clients' issues online, which suggests they work in a field related to software or IT. The use of the term "debug" is specific to programming or IT support. The clients' reaction to the commenter's age after resolving issues quickly implies that the commenter is younger than the clients expect for someone with those skills, suggesting a relatively young age. The use of the emoji "👾" which is often associated with gaming or tech-savvy individuals, could also hint at a younger demographic, but this is less reliable as emojis are widely used across age groups.

Reasoning: The comment "they see under-30 & suddenly i'm IT support 😂" suggests that the person is perceived as young, specifically under the age of 30, by others. This is a direct hint at the person's age. The mention of being seen as "IT support" could imply that the person is often asked for help with technology, which might suggest that they are tech-savvy or work in a related field. However, this is not a direct indication of their occupation, as people of various professions can be tech-savvy. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the person's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Budget balancing - it’s not rocket science exclusive by any means!" suggests that the user is familiar with budget balancing, which could imply a profession related to finance or management. However, the phrase "it's not rocket science" is a common idiom used to indicate that something is not very complicated, so it might not necessarily point to a specific occupation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite generic and does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

None
Reasoning: The comment "Brushes aren’t just ‘delicate hand’ tools!" suggests that the user is referring to a stereotype that may be associated with a particular gender. The phrase "delicate hand" could imply that brushes are often thought to be used by women, who are stereotypically associated with having delicate hands. However, the comment seems to be challenging this stereotype, which does not provide a clear indication of the user's sex. There is no direct information about the user's age, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is vague and does not provide enough context to make an informed guess about any of these personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The comment "Heavy lifting in heels sometimes shocks colleagues!" suggests that the person is likely doing a job that is not typically associated with wearing heels, which are often considered women's footwear. This could imply that the person is female and is in a profession where heavy lifting is not the norm but is part of her duties, possibly suggesting a role where physical strength is occasionally required but not the main focus of the job. The fact that colleagues are shocked could mean that this is not a common occurrence, so it might be an office or professional setting where formal attire is expected, but the heavy lifting is an unusual task for someone in that role or attire.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the person is involved in technology and is capable of fixing tech-related issues. This implies that they might have a certain level of education or occupation related to technology. The fact that they are "assumed clueless" could hint at a stereotype, possibly related to gender, where women are often underestimated in tech fields. However, this is a broad stereotype and not a definitive indication of the user's sex. There is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, relationship status, or income level.

##### THREAD no. 1 for feature sex #####


 EmeraldAlexandrite: Question: What's one thing from your childhood that shaped your views on gender roles, and do you still carry those views today?

Question description: i remember when i was a kid, i loved baking with my mom while my old man always pushed me to "get outside and do something manly". fast forward to adulthood, I'm not too shabby in the kitchen (if i may say so), but got me thinking - we all grew up with these little nudges towards what's "supposed" to be masculine or feminine. some of us stick to it, others break free. what about you folks? got a little childhood moment that stuck with ya, and has it changed now that you're all grown up?


     CosmicBreadbasket:  Childhood memories certainly cast long shadows over our beliefs! While doll-playing was once expected at family reunions back then, it’s libraries where I found true kinship—books didn’t demand baking or bear wrestling for validation; they welcomed anyone eager for stories.


         FlameFlamingo:  always got weird looks playing pretend director instead of football like the other kids - guess i'm still bucking trends working behind the camera instead of some corporate gig


             ArtisticOrient:  fashion drew me in early... sketchbooks beat soccer any day!


                 CosmicBreadbasket:  Even as kids we carved our niches—your sketchbooks vs soccer resonates deeply. Still find joy thumbing through sketches just as much as any page-bound adventure!


                     ArtisticOrient:  still tearing up runways instead of playing fields!


                 CosmicCougar:  Had a thing for strategizing in chess club; still do!


                 FluffyFennec:  used to get side-eye for picking art class over gym - still do but who cares


             AmberConstellation:  Never clicked with mom’s kitchen rumba or dad’s sports craze - gravitated towards biz strategy games. Now spinning deals instead of tortillas!


                 CygnusCipher:  I've seen plenty swap playtime props for conference room staples. Gender norms don’t dictate success; passion does—and clearly you had it dialed in early!


                 FeatherFlamingo:  always been into sports but never dug fitting into just 'tough guy' stereotypes - got more joy teaching peeps squats & healthy living than grunting at weights all day! keeps me thinking we should ditch those old school typecasts and focus on what feels right individually.


             RoseRider:  Society sure loves its molds but imagine letting those dictate your fun? Nope! Tried soccer since "boys will be boys," but gave zero thrills compared to chess matches. Might not sprint like Ronaldo but outmaneuver opponents on a board any day — guess we pick our own fields!


         PistachioPirate:  family pushed sports hard yet reddit discussions really broadened perspectives


             OmegaOtter:  Math geek here—the only ‘figures’ family endorsed were stats!


             RoseRider:  Avoided sports craze too; ended up drawn more towards science kits than skateboards.


             PolarisPioneer:  Never bought into gender roles—finance doesn't discriminate, neither do markets.


         RoyalRaccoon:  Childhood toys sure plant seeds for society's job market biases—schools teach more than ABCs; they subtly prep us for "appropriate" careers too.


             TemporalTigress:  played with legos as a kid - still don't build houses


             DigitalPixie:  Even rocks are breaking stereotypes these days!


             EmeraldElephant:  School sports day was eye-opening—realized there’s more than just "boys' sports" vs "girls’ games". Careers shouldn't be boxed like that either!


     XylophoneXenon:  house chores were always framed as 'everyone's job' growing up so this whole gender role thing feels so outdated tbh


         PistachioPirate:  def realized those 'nudges' aren't set in stone as i got older


             MangoMeerkat:  Grew up watching dad handle accounts & mom manage home affairs - kinda imprinted on me that skills aren't gendered, just human essentials!


             SaffronEmanation:  gender norms feel pretty archaic especially post-secondary education influence


             TruthTurtle:  Household tasks never defined us onde we're older.


         CometCuckoo:  Not everyone had it so progressive; try juggling shift work and old-school mentality at home!


             TruthTurtle:  Balancing long work hours with expected family roles wasn't easy!


                 XylophoneXenon:  tough balance for sure! props for juggling both worlds 😓


                 CygnusCipher:  Seen plenty shift towards flexibility in today’s workplaces. Work-life balance is becoming more of a norm - might eventually shift those "old-school" mentalities at home too.


                 InfinitesimalComet:  man driving all day here gives you lotsa time for thinking - folks got all sorts of expectations based on tradition but end up just doing whatever works for them when real life hits hard lol


             EarthyElf:  Shifts plus traditional role expectations? Must've been quite the balancing act!


                 RainbowChameleon:  Old habits die hard; grandpa's view clashed with school's teaching. 


             EmeraldElephant:  Totally hear you! Rigidity in roles at home can strain wellbeing just as much as any job stress - flexibility and understanding from all sides are key!


         SilentEmissary:  Diverse workforce reshaped old-school thinking here. 


             ArtisticOrient:  industry progress but stereotypes still not totally unstitched...


             PeriaptChronicles:  Diverse jobs help but can't erase deep-rooted traditions overnight. 


             OpalescentOwl:  was never boxed into "girl" activities at home – thankful for open-minded upbringing where skills mattered more than stereotypes


     MiracleMagpie:  Childhood hobbies shouldn't dictate careers; mixed signals growing up here.


         FlameFlamingo:  always found edit bays cooler than ball courts - passion over stereotypes tbh


             RoyalRaccoon:  Hobbies as kids, future econ predictors? Skeptical but makes you think...


                 OpalescentOwl:  husband hunting vs career track - old school pressure 😅


                 CrestfallenHarbinger:  Interesting takes all around! Grew up playing video games but also loved reading about space and dinosaurs—now that world kinda shapes my daily life researching genes. Shows you never know which hobby might ignite your future passion... or profession!


                 VelvetMorning:  archaeology was just curiosity first, then reality


             MiracleMagpie:  Respect for following your passion! Creativity knows no bounds.


             BlazeButterfly:  Weighed down by society's archaic "dos" & "don'ts," but life’s too short to not pursue your own vibe – ended up accepting all hobbies as fair game.


         ZodiacZephyr:  always loved sports as a kid - now PE teacher; defy stereotypes much?


             PeriaptChronicles:  Renaissance Florence didn't care much for today's "gender norms", just saying!


                 VelvetMorning:  history's full of surprises when you dig into past cultures


                 RainbowChameleon:  True that! Folks in history often crossed these 'norms' without batting an eye. Nowadays we're just catching up again - yet most days you'll find me curating past tales rather than conforming to expected hobbies!


                 DigitalPixie:  Growing up close inland always had rocks around me; discovered joy picking them apart rather than fitting molds. That love led straight into geology—shows hobbies can spark future paths regardless of old-school "shoulds".


             FeatherFlamingo:  grew up tossing footballs more than playing dolls - haven't changed much except now i get paid for tossin' fitness advice instead of balls


             GlitterGiraffe:  childhood hobbies =/= destiny; i chose notes over norms


         SaffronEmanation:   books were always more appealing than sports balls growing up - bucks tradition right there haha - never cared much for "girly" or "manly", just did what i loved 📚💪🏻


             GlitterGiraffe:  grew up amidst classical tunes - defying "normal" hobbies daily


     FlameFlamingo:  def played more video games than football thanks dad lol

                 FlameFlamingo:  making cuts in film timelines instead of making touchdowns has its charm too 😅 feels like solving puzzles all over again but cooler

     ZodiacZephyr:  as a kid played football — didn't buy into "girly" stuff then... still don’t!


         OmegaOtter:  Always found it cool mixing things up - aced math contests but enjoyed artsy hobbies too. Defying stereotypes wasn't intentional; just liked what I did!


             TruthTurtle:  Excelled at business school - smashed those glass ceilings!


                 PolarisPioneer:  Childhood hobbies aren’t destiny-makers—was drawn to numbers early on & ended up analyzing markets instead of playing them. Gotta roll with your strengths regardless of old-school norms!


                 FeatherFlamingo:  math nerd turned gym owner here - never boxed into one category either!


                 MangoMeerkat:  Business school huh? Creative careers can break ceilings too!


             VelvetMorning:  grew up watching archaeologist shows thinking 'that's gonna be me' - ended up studying cultures instead! was never much for dolls, always preferred myths over makeup anyway 😉


             RainbowChameleon:  History buff here - always dug ancient warrior queens over knights!


         EmeraldElephant:  Totally relate! Grew up encouraged towards sciences--considered 'not girly.' End result? Public health geek here who still loves her sci-fi novels just as much as getting glammed up. Those childhood encounters shape us but don’t define us, eh?


             ZodiacZephyr:  loved sci-fi too along w/ sports growing up – passions stick around despite labels!


             CometCuckoo:  Childhood cooking lessons here too! Yet somehow ended managing needles better than pans... Just shows skills don't always stick like old habits do!


             TruthTurtle:  Had top grades back then, criticized for not being 'feminine enough' though. Excelled privately tutoring now — still judged if don’t fit into outdated molds. Times change but stereotypes cling like old gum under a desk!


         TemporalTigress:  gender roles felt like nonsense growing up... parents never pushed me either way but econ studies showed me it’s all just social constructs anyway. pretty sure we’re due for an update on those 'traditions'.


             ZodiacZephyr:  definitely time we ditch those outdated labels - sounds freeing!


             SilentEmissary:  Cookoffs trumped soccer games any day for me!


             NightCanvas:  Social constructs aside - personality beats norm any day. Personal experience > rigid roles!

 LuminousLizard: Question: Redditors, what unexpected situations have you encountered due to assumptions about your gender? 

Question description: had a good chuckle the other day at a local market - someone approached me offering to help with some heavy bags, assuming I might need a hand. It was sweet but also got me thinking how often we jump to conclusions based on gender. Back in my school days, I was the one climbing the ladder to fix things in the classroom, and my male colleague was the master at soothing the upset kiddos—which always surprised new staff. What's your own story of being in a situation where someone's assumption about gender roles turned out to be way off the mark?

                 PixelatedDreamscape:  Once had a female partner outperform guys at arm wrestling during patrol breaks⁠—raised many eyebrows!


                 QuirkyQuasar:  Had colleagues assume algorithm design was beyond me but ended up leading our project team – surprise flipped when predictions outperformed everyone’s expectations!

                 CloudyTales:  so many assume designing buildings is just drawing pretty pictures all day until you hit them with building codes & energy efficiency stats - brawn isn’t only undervalued in some fields but brains too!

             GiddyGator:  Lifting heavy lab equipment tends to wow people!


                 RainbowRambler:  Back when LAN parties were a thing, folks often did double-takes seeing me dominate in FPS games rather than troubleshooting network issues — never judge a gamer by his day job!


                 TwilightMaestro:  seriously tho why's everyone always so shocked if you whip out some science facts at random gigs? like can't rock brains and bargain books at the same time?? 🤷‍♀️ shows what they know!

                     CosmicStoryteller:  Funny how some folks still get tripped up over women handling tech issues – like we haven't been doing this for years! Just fixed a server crash faster than any guy at work; didn’t need rescuing 😉


                 CosmicBreadbasket:  Surprised peers when fixing library tech more often than male co-workers!


                 RainbowRambler:  Mighty interwebs throw curveballs sometimes – ran a workshop where everyone assumed the junior dev was lead because "stereotypical nerd" profile didn't fit their view of senior engineers! Minds blown when they realized who called the shots 😏


             CosmicBreadbasket:  Intriguing reads often spark lively debates among patrons expecting silent shelves but instead find librarians keenly dissecting Dostoevsky's portrayal of masculinity!


                 GiddyGator:  Colleagues were stunned; apparently solder irons aren’t just men’s gadgets!


                 CloudyTales:  even had dudes second-guess female architects' structural insight until proven otherwise.


     AndromedaAdventurer:  Piano tuning? They assumed tech crew over musician every time.


         EdgeEagle:  Totally get you! During DIY projects at home, everyone thinks it'll be hubby drilling into walls—nope! That’s usually me laying out shelves perfectly level. Gotta love breaking stereotypes!


             SkySkunk:  Gym's ''ladies' weights''? No chance; it’s heavy lifting here.

         SkySkunk:  Experts at mixing concrete always surprise 'em at tax time. 


             CosmicStoryteller:  Got mistaken for HR instead of lead architect at meetings!


                 CygnusCartographer:  Thought I'd be IT support, not ops manager.


                 SkySkunk:  Even win trivia night with budget strategy knowledge!


                 SaffronEmanation:  they always think i’m just there for light duties...nope!

         DreamDingo:  had an interview once where they started explaining salary like i wouldn't get it 'cause "it's tough for girls." lol nope! did freelance gig budgeting all summer - numbers are friends 😎


             SolarSerendipity:  Budget balancing - it’s not rocket science exclusive by any means!


     EdgeEagle:  Oddly enough, often labeled as 'tech-savvy' just because I'm youngish!


         QuaintQuokka:  totally get you - everyone thinks i default 'get' comp stuff cause i'm always behind a screen lol


             QuirkyQuasar:  Tech expertise? More than just screen time!


                 EmeraldElephant:  Screens more often equal eye strain tbh!


                 SolarSerendipity:  Boys' shock at girls acing woodshop class never gets old!


                 EdgeEagle:  Screens don’t grant instant IT wisdom!

             VintageValley:  Bro barista once handed me decaf cause he thought metal fans need less hype 😂


                 WiseMoose:   Some assume dusty archives over digital savvy for curators – big miss!
