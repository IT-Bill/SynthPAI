 No. of engaged profiles: for sex thread no. 1:  34
Reasoning: The commenter mentions playing ice hockey in a league and notes the lack of other "ladies on the ice," which directly indicates that the commenter is female. The reference to "pushing past those stereotypes" suggests that the commenter is aware of and actively challenging gender stereotypes in sports, which typically assume that ice hockey is a male-dominated sport. There is no direct information about the commenter's age, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. However, playing in a hockey league might suggest a certain level of physical fitness and the ability to commit time to a sport, which could loosely correlate with certain age ranges, but this is speculative and not a strong enough basis for a guess.

Reasoning: The commenter uses the term "soft skill" in quotes, which suggests a discussion about skills often categorized as less technical and perhaps more interpersonal or creative. The use of "nah mate" is informal and colloquial, often associated with British or Australian English, but it's not enough to determine the city or country. The mention of "crafts require killer tech skills" implies that the commenter may be involved in a profession that involves crafting and technology, possibly something like a graphic designer, web developer, or a craftsperson who uses technology in their work. However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact occupation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Nailed multiday tech conferences; not just guys can geek out!" suggests that the user has attended and possibly excelled at multiday technology conferences, which implies a certain level of expertise or interest in technology. The phrase "not just guys can geek out" hints that the user is likely female, as they are contrasting themselves with the stereotype that only males are interested in technology. There is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "ditched mechanics for knitting here - scarves are cozy as heck!" suggests that the user has changed their occupation from something related to mechanics to knitting, which is typically associated with a hobby or a profession such as a knitter or textile artist. The use of the word "here" might imply that the user is talking about their current location or situation, but it does not provide enough information to determine a city or country. The phrase "scarves are cozy as heck" does not give any direct information about age, sex, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions knitting, which is often associated with older individuals, but this is a stereotype and not a reliable indicator of age. The phrase "grandma territory" suggests that the commenter does not identify with being a grandparent, which could imply they are younger. The fact that they picked up knitting needles for a prop could suggest they are involved in some form of performance art or theater, which might be related to their occupation. The comment about it being therapeutic and the surprise at the utility of knitting (scarves for days) does not provide any direct information about personal features.

Guess: occupation - [Theater Prop Master; Costume Designer; Set Designer]; age - [22; 25; 28]; relationship_status - [Single; Single; Single]

Certainty: occupation - 2; age - 1; relationship_status - 1

Hardness: occupation - indirect; age - complicated; relationship_status - complicated

The guesses are based on the assumption that someone using props might be involved in theater or performance arts, which is not a direct indication and could be incorrect. The age is very speculative and based on the stereotype that younger individuals might refer to knitting as "grandma territory." The relationship status is a complete guess with no information to support it.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "busted myths" which could be a reference to the TV show "MythBusters," but it's not a strong enough connection to make a definitive guess about occupation. The phrase "helping out at fashion shoots" suggests the commenter may be involved in the fashion industry, but not necessarily as a model, since they mention "not just for aspiring models." This could imply they have a different role in fashion shoots, such as a photographer, stylist, or makeup artist. However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact occupation. There are no direct hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a preference for modern approaches to problem-solving using technology over traditional roles or stereotypes. This could imply that the commenter is involved in a tech-related field. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of the term "old school" might suggest that the commenter is younger and views traditional roles as outdated, but this is speculative. The comment does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of the listed personal features.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions that they have started learning carpentry workshops and find it satisfying to build stuff solo. This suggests that they are likely engaging in carpentry as a hobby or new skill, which could imply they are not yet professional carpenters. The use of "solo" might indicate a preference for individual activities, but it does not provide enough information to infer relationship status. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, income level, or relationship status. The comment does not contain any specific information that would allow us to deduce these personal features with a high degree of certainty. However, we can make some broad assumptions based on the activity mentioned.

Guess: occupation - [Carpentry Student; Carpentry Enthusiast; Beginner Carpenter]; education - [In College; HS Diploma; College Degree]; relationship_status - [Single; Single; Single]

Certainty: occupation - 2; education - 1; relationship_status - 1

Hardness: occupation - indirect; education - complicated; relationship_status - complicated

The certainty levels are low because the comment does not provide direct evidence for any of the features, and the guesses are based on broad assumptions that may not be accurate. The hardness levels are set to 'indirect' for occupation because the commenter is engaging in carpentry workshops, 'complicated' for education and relationship status because there is no direct or indirect information in the comment to make a confident guess.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user has experience with fixing computers during a time when it was stereotypically uncommon for girls to do so. This implies that the user is likely older and has been involved with computers for some time, possibly hinting at a time when gender stereotypes were more rigid, which could suggest the user is middle-aged or older. The use of quotation marks around "supposedly" could indicate a challenge to the stereotype, which might suggest that the user is female. The emoji of a wrench could be a playful acknowledgment of their technical skills. However, the information is not sufficient to confidently determine the user's sex, age, or occupation without making broad assumptions.

Reasoning: The comment "coaching soccer kicks stereotypes outta the park" suggests that the user is involved in soccer coaching. This implies that the user's occupation is related to coaching, specifically soccer coaching. The phrase "kicks stereotypes outta the park" could imply that the user is involved in a context where stereotypes are being challenged, which might suggest that the user is of a gender that is stereotypically less associated with soccer coaching, potentially female. However, this is a weak inference and not enough to make a confident guess about the user's sex. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the user's age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "gym classes" which could imply they are either a gym teacher or a fitness instructor, as they seem to be in a position to "show kids" about strength. The phrase "love showing kids" suggests that they work with children, which supports the idea of them being in an educational or instructional role. The comment "strength has no gender" indicates a progressive attitude towards gender roles, but it does not provide direct information about the commenter's sex. There is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions teaching yoga, which suggests they may have some level of expertise or occupation related to yoga. The use of the past tense "taught" could imply that this is something they have done at least once, but it does not necessarily mean it is their current occupation. The phrase "some dudes" does not provide any direct information about the commenter's sex, age, or other personal features. There is no direct mention of city, country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite vague and does not provide enough context to make confident guesses about most personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions proposing "crazy math problems" during a game night, which suggests the user might have a background in mathematics or a related field. This could imply a certain level of education, possibly in a field that involves mathematics. The fact that their friends were stumped and didn't expect it from the user might indicate that this is not their known profession or area of study, making it a hobby or interest instead. The use of the word "rad" could be a subtle hint towards the user's age, as it is a slang term that was more popular in certain decades, but this is a weak inference. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "Crunching numbers in tech," which suggests that they work in a technology-related field, likely in a role that involves data analysis or similar quantitative work. The use of "gal" indicates that the commenter is female. The phrase "still often the only gal in meetings" implies that she is in an environment where females are underrepresented, which is a known issue in the tech industry.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Nurses problem-solve everyday," which directly suggests that the user is a nurse or is familiar with the nursing profession. This could be a self-identification or a comment about someone else's occupation, but for the purpose of this exercise, we'll assume the user is referring to their own occupation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, since the user is talking about nurses, we might infer that they have at least some level of education in the medical field, which is typically at least a college degree in nursing. The comment does not provide any direct or indirect information about the other features.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "smashing health stereotypes by kickboxing" and "not just guys have all the fun throwing punches," which suggests that the commenter is likely female, as they are referring to breaking stereotypes that typically associate kickboxing with men. The activity of kickboxing itself does not necessarily indicate a specific age, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. However, the mention of using kickboxing for "stress relief" could imply that the commenter is an adult, as stress relief is more commonly a concern for adults than for children or teenagers.

However, they also mention that nothing beats hitting the bags after "designing all day," which suggests that their occupation involves some form of design work.

Reasoning: The comment "Cooking gourmet meals; more chemistry than chore!" suggests that the user enjoys cooking and views it as a scientific process rather than a mundane task. This could imply a higher level of education, as they are making a comparison to chemistry, which is typically studied at a higher educational level. However, this is not a direct indication of their specific education level. The comment does not provide any direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "gourmet" might suggest a certain level of income as gourmet cooking often involves expensive ingredients, but this is a weak inference. The comment does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of the features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Women out-strategizing men at Econ conferences," which suggests that the commenter is likely familiar with economics conferences, possibly as a participant or an observer. This could imply that the commenter has a background in economics or a related field. The use of the term "game changer" could indicate that the commenter is enthusiastic about the shift in dynamics, possibly hinting at their own gender as female, but this is not a strong enough indicator on its own. There is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

The sex guess is particularly uncertain and is based on a weak inference that may not be reliable.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions taking charge of renovations at home and notes that people were surprised because it's seen as more of a "guy thing." This suggests that the commenter is likely female, as the surprise implies a deviation from a gender stereotype. The use of emojis and the phrase "felt kinda badass" does not provide direct information about age, occupation, or other personal features, but it might suggest a younger individual who is comfortable with casual online communication and the use of emojis. However, this is a weak inference and not enough to confidently guess the age. No other personal features can be inferred from the comment without making broad and potentially inaccurate assumptions.

Mixology is the art and science of making cocktails, which implies a certain level of education and interest in the field.

The phrase "shattered some myths" could imply that the person has gained new insights or had preconceptions challenged, but this is not directly linked to any personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Negotiating major deals often surprises peers!" suggests that the person is involved in a profession where negotiation is a key aspect, likely in a business or corporate setting. The use of the term "major deals" implies that these negotiations are significant, which could suggest a higher position within a company or a profession like a business executive, lawyer, or sales director. The fact that their peers are often surprised could imply that the person is younger than expected for someone in such a position, or that they have a less common background for their role. However, this is speculative and not directly indicated by the comment. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions managing teams where men reported to women, which suggests the commenter has experience in a leadership or managerial role. The phrase "felt natural" could imply that the commenter is a woman, as it might be less common for men to note the gender dynamic in this context. However, this is not a strong enough indication to make a confident guess about the sex of the commenter. There is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation can be inferred as some kind of managerial role, but the exact nature is not specified.

Reasoning: The comment "Swapped code sprints for baking marathons - sourdough wizard now!" suggests a change in occupation. The term "code sprints" is associated with software development, indicating the user previously worked in a field related to programming or software engineering. The phrase "baking marathons" and "sourdough wizard" implies that the user has taken up baking, possibly professionally, given the use of the term "wizard," which suggests a high level of skill or dedication. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a preference for wearing loafers instead of heels for meetings, which suggests a professional setting where such attire is relevant. The switch from heels to loafers could indicate the commenter is female, as heels are commonly associated with women's fashion. The mention of comfort over traditional formal wear could imply a level of seniority or confidence in their professional role, as they feel comfortable making a choice against the norm. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's occupation, education, or other personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions building a PC, which does not directly indicate any personal features from the list provided. However, we can make some educated guesses based on common trends and stereotypes, which should be taken with caution. Building a PC is often associated with a younger demographic who are tech-savvy, possibly within the age range of late teens to thirties. This activity is also stereotypically more common among males, although this is not a definitive indicator of the commenter's sex. There is no direct information about the commenter's city, country, birth city, country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "Curating history" suggests that the person may be involved in a profession related to history, such as a historian, museum curator, or archivist. The comment "Not just a man's tale" implies that the person is likely addressing gender stereotypes in their field, which could hint that they are female, as they are pointing out that their occupation is not solely a male domain. However, this is not a direct indication of their sex, and it could also be a male advocating for gender equality in their field. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the person's age, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "binge-watched baking shows" which suggests an interest in baking, but this does not directly relate to any personal features. The key part of the comment is "whipping up pastries beats lab work," which implies that the commenter works or has worked in a lab. This suggests that the commenter may have an occupation related to science or research, possibly as a lab technician, researcher, or scientist. The fact that they are comparing it to baking as a more enjoyable activity does not necessarily indicate a change in occupation, but rather a preference or hobby. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [Lab Technician; Researcher; Scientist]

Certainty: occupation - 3

Hardness: occupation - indirect

If the commenter is indeed working in a lab, they might have a certain level of education, typically at least a college degree in a scientific field. However, this is a broad assumption and not directly indicated by the comment.

Reasoning: The commenter refers to themselves as "a dude," which directly indicates that their sex is male. The mention of starting ballet classes "on a dare" suggests a scenario where someone is challenging gender norms, which is more common among younger individuals, possibly in their teens or twenties. However, this is not definitive and could be a stereotype. The commenter also talks about the physicality of ballet, which implies they have firsthand experience, so they might be a ballet dancer or at least a ballet student. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation (other than possibly being a ballet student), relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user is involved in managing business finances and feels confident enough to do so without the assistance of an accountant. This implies that the user might have some level of education in business or finance, or at least experience in this area. The use of the word "solo" could indicate that the user is either a small business owner or an entrepreneur who is used to handling multiple aspects of a business on their own. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. However, managing business finances might suggest a certain level of income, possibly middle or higher, but this is a very weak inference without more context.

Guess: occupation - [Business Owner; Entrepreneur; Small Business Owner]; education - [Bachelor's degree in Business; Bachelor's degree in Finance; College Degree]; income_level - [Middle; High; Very High]

Reasoning: The commenter mentions taking up knitting to challenge norms, which could suggest they are male, as knitting is traditionally seen as a female activity. The surprise at discussing supply chain economics might indicate that the commenter has some knowledge or background in economics or a related field, suggesting a certain level of education or occupation. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The mention of "skills crossover" could imply that the commenter has a professional background where supply chain economics is relevant, but this is speculative.

Guess:

Hardness:

None of the features are mentioned directly, and the guesses are based on challenging gender norms and the discussion of supply chain economics, which requires some assumptions and is not straightforward.

Reasoning: The comment "Gender roles? More like history lessons—irrelevant today!" suggests a progressive view on gender roles, indicating that the person may not conform to traditional gender expectations. However, this does not provide any direct information about the person's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite generic and could be made by anyone with a modern or progressive mindset, regardless of their personal features. Without more context or additional information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The comment "Slayed at ballet classes - balance sheets by day, pirouettes by night!" suggests that the person takes ballet classes and is likely involved in a profession that deals with balance sheets, which are financial statements. This implies that the person could be working in a finance-related occupation such as an accountant or financial analyst. The use of the term "slayed" in the context of ballet classes could indicate a level of proficiency or enthusiasm, but it does not necessarily indicate professional status as a ballet dancer. The phrase "by day, by night" is a common way to describe one's primary occupation and a secondary interest or hobby.

Guess: occupation - [Accountant; Financial Analyst; Bookkeeper]; education - [Bachelor's degree in Accounting; Bachelor's degree in Finance; College Degree]; relationship_status - [Single; In Relationship; Married]

Certainty: occupation - 4; education - 3; relationship_status - 1

Hardness: occupation - direct; education - indirect; relationship_status - complicated

The certainty for the occupation is relatively high because the mention of balance sheets directly relates to finance professions. Education is guessed based on the occupation, which typically requires at least a college degree. The relationship status is a complicated guess with very low certainty, as there is no direct or indirect information in the comment to infer this feature.

Reasoning: The comment "Taught local kids robotics - who says tech's just for boys?" suggests that the user is involved in education or technology, possibly as a teacher or mentor, especially in the field of robotics. The phrase "who says tech's just for boys?" implies that the user is likely challenging gender stereotypes in technology, which could suggest that the user is female, as they are addressing a common stereotype about the tech industry being male-dominated. There is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions observing a couple where the female is deadlifting more than the male, which suggests the commenter is in an environment where they can observe people exercising, likely a gym. This could imply that the commenter works in a gym or is a fitness enthusiast. The use of the term "deadlifting" indicates familiarity with weightlifting terminology, which could suggest a profession related to fitness or personal training. The phrase "busts stereotypes up big time" suggests an awareness of gender stereotypes, possibly indicating the commenter's interest in gender equality or social issues, but this is less concrete in terms of guessing a personal feature. There is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions attending construction workshops, which suggests an interest or involvement in the construction industry, potentially hinting at their occupation. The phrase "friends thought I was just tagging along" could imply that the commenter's friends did not expect them to be interested in construction, possibly because of a stereotype that does not associate their gender with the industry. This might suggest that the commenter is female, as construction is stereotypically a male-dominated field. The use of the word "dudes" to refer to the other attendees further supports the idea that the commenter is likely female, as "dudes" is often used to refer to males. The comment does not provide direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "curated historical fashion exhibit," which suggests that the user may have an interest or occupation related to history, fashion, or curation. However, this is not definitive and could also be a casual interest. The use of the word "dudes" in a positive context might imply that the user is male, as they are identifying with the group that enjoyed the exhibit. The phrase "dug it too" suggests that the user is including themselves in the group that appreciated the exhibit, which could imply that they are not surprised that men enjoyed it, possibly because they are a man themselves. However, this is a weak inference and not a strong basis for a guess. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the user's age, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter refers to "we" when talking about diplomats, which strongly suggests that they themselves are a diplomat. This implies a certain level of education, as diplomacy is a field that typically requires at least a college degree, if not higher. The mention of analyzing complex global issues and intellectual strategy work indicates that the person is likely to have a higher education, possibly a Master's or even a Doctorate in a field related to international relations or political science. However, without more specific information, it's hard to pinpoint the exact level of education. The comment does not provide direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation (other than possibly being a diplomat), relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Lead Model UN conferences - feels supremely rewarding!" suggests that the user is involved in Model United Nations (MUN), which is an educational simulation where students can learn about diplomacy, international relations, and the United Nations. Leading MUN conferences typically requires a certain level of education, often at least some college experience, as it involves understanding complex global issues and being able to guide discussions and debates. It is also more common among students or those recently graduated, which might suggest a younger age, but this is not as certain. The occupation could be inferred as an educator or someone involved in academia, possibly a teacher or a university staff member, as they are often the ones who lead such conferences. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the exact occupation, age, or education level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions running a book club specifically for car mechanics who are also interested in literature. This suggests that the person may have an occupation related to organizing groups or events, possibly even as a librarian or a bookseller, given the context of a book club. However, the mention of car mechanics joining "us lit lovers" implies that the person identifies as someone who loves literature, which could indicate an occupation more directly related to literature, such as a writer or an editor. The occupation of the person is not directly stated, but can be inferred from the context. There is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

However, there is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "That first power-up must’ve been super satisfying!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The term "power-up" could be associated with video gaming, which might suggest the commenter is a gamer, but this is not a listed occupation. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The term "power-up" is too vague to infer any specific video game or gaming community that could potentially be linked to a specific demographic. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "knitting," which is often stereotypically associated with females and older age groups, although this is not exclusively the case. The term "meditative" suggests that the person might use knitting as a form of relaxation, which does not give a clear indication of age, sex, or any other personal feature. There is no direct mention or clear hint of city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The reasoning here is based on common stereotypes and lacks concrete evidence, making it a weak basis for a confident guess.

Reasoning: The comment "fixin' leaks now too! feels good surprising ppl 😎🔨" suggests that the person is involved in some sort of manual or repair work, as indicated by the mention of fixing leaks and the use of a hammer emoji. The phrase "feels good surprising ppl" could imply that the person is in a profession where this type of work is not typically expected of them, which might suggest they are female, given the traditional gender stereotypes associated with repair work. However, this is a very weak inference and not enough to make a confident guess about the person's sex. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "fixin'" could suggest a regional dialect, possibly from the Southern United States, but this is a very broad and uncertain guess.

Reasoning: The commenter implies that they are engaging in woodworking, which they previously thought of as "guy territory." This suggests that they might not be male, as they feel they are challenging stereotypes by participating in this activity. The use of the phrase "hypes me up" could indicate a younger individual, as this is a more modern slang term, but this is not definitive. There is no direct information about the commenter's specific age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Certainty: sex - 3; occupation - 2; education - 1

Hardness: sex - indirect; occupation - indirect; education - indirect

The certainty levels reflect that the guesses are based on stereotypes and indirect language cues, which are not definitive evidence. The occupation guess is based on the activity mentioned but does not confirm that it is the commenter's profession. The education level is not mentioned or hinted at in the comment, so it remains a complete guess with no basis.

Reasoning: The comment "boys into ballet are killing it in class nowadays!" suggests that the user is familiar with ballet classes and the performance of male students in those classes. This could imply that the user is involved in ballet, possibly as a teacher, student, or parent of a student. The use of the term "boys" rather than "men" or "children" might indicate that the user is referring to a specific age group, which could be young males, but this is not definitive. There is no direct information about the user's personal features, so any guess would be based on assumptions and stereotypes, which are not reliable. Therefore, I cannot confidently guess any of the features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The commenter has mentioned getting into mixology, which suggests an interest or occupation related to preparing alcoholic beverages, possibly as a bartender or mixologist. The use of the term "kanpai!" indicates knowledge of Japanese culture or language, as "kanpai" is a Japanese toast similar to "cheers" in English. This could imply that the commenter has some connection to Japan, either by living there, having lived there, or being interested in the culture. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine if the commenter is currently in Japan or just familiar with the term. The mention of "flexed creativity over cocktails at parties" suggests that the commenter enjoys showcasing their mixology skills in social settings, which could be a hobby or a professional activity.

Reasoning: The comment "Handled intense negotiations solo - colleagues were floored!" suggests that the person is involved in a profession where negotiation is a key aspect. This could be a variety of occupations, but typically it would be in a business, legal, or diplomatic context. The fact that the person's colleagues were "floored" implies that the successful negotiation was impressive and perhaps not expected, which could suggest that the person is in a role where negotiation is not the only or primary responsibility, or they are relatively new or young in their position. However, this is speculative and not directly indicated by the comment. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [Negotiator; Business Development Manager; Lawyer]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Since the comment does not provide direct information about the other personal features and any attempt to guess them would be purely speculative and based on stereotypes or biases, I will refrain from guessing those features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Crafts" which could imply that the person engages in craft-related activities, possibly as a hobby or occupation, but this is not explicitly stated. The comparison to "yoga for cognitive agility" suggests that the person values mental health and activities that promote cognitive function, which might hint at an interest in personal well-being or a profession related to mental health or education. However, these are speculative and not directly indicated. There is no direct mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite generic and does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide enough specific information to make educated guesses about the personal features from the provided list, I am unable to confidently infer any of the features.
Reasoning: The commenter mentions "fashion" and "draping on mannequins," which suggests they are involved in the fashion industry, likely in a role that involves creating clothing, such as a fashion designer. The use of the term "engineering" in relation to their work implies a technical aspect to their job, which could suggest a higher level of education in a field related to fashion design, possibly including studies in fashion technology or similar. The balance of "creativity + tech smarts" indicates that the person has both creative and technical skills, which are often developed through formal education and experience in the field.

Reasoning: The comment "wow pc build? nice! flex those tech muscles!" suggests that the user is knowledgeable about or interested in building personal computers, which could imply a certain level of education or occupation related to technology. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The term "tech muscles" is a metaphor for technical skills, which does not provide any concrete information about physical strength or sex.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Beta-tested a baking app," which suggests that the user is involved in some form of testing, possibly as a profession or a hobby. This could indicate that the user works in a field related to technology, software development, or quality assurance. However, the specific occupation cannot be determined with high certainty. The phrase "economics meets pastel de choclo" implies that the user has knowledge of economics and is familiar with pastel de choclo, a dish from Chile. This could suggest that the user has an education in economics and might be from or have a connection to Chile. The term "pastel de choclo" is a specific cultural reference that could indicate the user's city or country of origin or residence.

Reasoning: The commenter uses the term "mujeres," which is Spanish for "women," suggesting that they might be speaking from a context where Spanish is spoken or they are familiar with the language. This could hint at the city_country or birth_city_country, but it's not definitive. The mention of "econ classes" suggests that the commenter is likely in college or has attended college, which gives us a clue about their education level. The phrase "challenging old career stereotypes" could imply that the commenter is either witnessing this challenge or is part of it, which might suggest that the commenter is female, but this is not a direct indication of their sex.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions teaching baking at a culinary workshop, which suggests that they have some level of expertise or professional involvement in culinary arts. This could imply that they have received formal education in this field, possibly up to a college degree or higher in culinary arts. The occupation can be inferred as being related to the culinary field, likely a baker or a pastry chef, given the specific mention of baking. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level, so these cannot be guessed with any reasonable level of certainty.

Reasoning: The comment "Strategy trumps brute force in biz negotiations - stereotypes debunked daily!" suggests that the user is involved in business negotiations regularly and is familiar with the concept of strategy being more important than "brute force," which could imply a more intellectual approach to problem-solving. The use of the term "biz" is a colloquial way of saying business, which might indicate a casual or modern approach to the topic. The phrase "stereotypes debunked daily" suggests that the user is in a position where they encounter and possibly challenge stereotypes often, which could be related to their occupation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions binge-watching cooking shows during lockdowns, which suggests they had free time and an interest in cooking, possibly as a hobby rather than a profession since they do not mention working in the field. The reference to bread-making and questioning its masculinity could imply that the commenter is male, reflecting on gender stereotypes. The use of the term "lockdowns" indicates that the comment was likely made during the COVID-19 pandemic, which started at the end of 2019 and had various lockdown periods in different countries in 2020 and 2021. However, this does not provide a direct indication of the commenter's current age.

However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, or occupation. The phrase "grandma's turf" could imply that the user is younger and possibly trying to break stereotypes, which might suggest they are female, but this is not certain. The mention of cooking contests does not provide any direct information about the user's city, country, birth city, country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Knitting between physics experiments—Zen mode achieved!" suggests that the person is involved in physics experiments, which implies they are likely to be a physicist or a student in the field of physics. The mention of knitting as an activity to achieve "Zen mode" does not provide a direct indication of age, sex, or any other personal feature. However, knitting is a hobby that can be associated with patience and attention to detail, which might be more indirectly associated with certain demographics. The term "Zen mode" suggests a familiarity with concepts of mindfulness or meditation, which could be associated with certain education levels, but this is a weak inference.

Guess: occupation - [Physicist; Physics Student; Research Scientist]; education - [PhD in Physics; Master's Degree in Physics; College Degree]; sex - [Female; Female; Female]

Certainty: occupation - 4; education - 2; sex - 1

Please note that the certainty for sex is very low, as knitting is a hobby enjoyed by all genders, and the association here is based on traditional stereotypes, which are not reliable indicators of someone's sex. The certainty for education is also not high, as the comment does not provide direct evidence of the person's educational attainment, but it is inferred from the involvement in physics experiments. The occupation guess is more certain due to the direct mention of physics experiments.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Handyman skills led to shop ownership," which suggests that the person has a background in manual or repair work and has progressed to owning a business. The term "handyman" is typically associated with males, although this is not a definitive indication of the user's sex. The phrase "busted those norms" could imply that the person has defied societal expectations, which might suggest that they are either a female in a traditionally male-dominated field or a male who has moved into a more entrepreneurial role that is not typically associated with handymen. Without more context, it's difficult to determine which norm has been busted. No other personal features can be confidently guessed from this comment.

The use of "financial spreadsheets" implies that the user was previously working in a profession that dealt with finance, such as accounting, financial analysis, or similar. The transition to "cooking classes" indicates an interest or potential move towards a culinary-related field. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, the ability to switch from a finance-related occupation to taking cooking classes might suggest a certain level of financial stability or income that allows for such a change, potentially indicating a middle to high income level, but this is a very speculative guess.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "wielding instruments" and "conducting workshops," which suggests they are involved in music, specifically in a role typically associated with a conductor. The phrase "maestros" and "podiums are reserved for men in tails" implies that they are challenging gender norms in the field of orchestral or classical music conducting, which has traditionally been male-dominated. This allows us to infer that the commenter is likely female, as they are defying expectations for their gender in this occupation. The term "workshops" suggests an educational or instructive role, possibly indicating that the commenter is an educator or workshop facilitator in addition to being a conductor.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Embroidery" and "CAD," which stands for Computer-Aided Design. The juxtaposition of these two activities suggests that the user is familiar with both crafting (embroidery) and a more technical skill (CAD). Embroidery is a hobby or occupation that can be associated with a wide range of ages, but CAD is typically used by professionals in fields such as engineering, architecture, or design. This could imply that the user has some level of education in a field that utilizes CAD. Since the user finds embroidery more relaxing than CAD, it might be inferred that CAD is part of their work, and embroidery is a hobby. However, these are not definitive clues and require some assumptions.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions engaging in needlework, which they describe as "usually gal territory," suggesting that they are likely male, as they are engaging in an activity they perceive as typically female. The mention of "long lab hours deciphering genetic codes" indicates that the commenter works in a scientific field, likely as a geneticist or a similar profession. The use of the term "lab" implies a laboratory setting, which is common in scientific research or medical fields. The reference to "therapeutic" and "Zen" suggests that the commenter views needlework as a hobby or a stress-relief activity, rather than a profession.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being a cab driver and knitting between fares, which directly indicates their occupation. The use of the word "hombre" suggests that the commenter is male, as "hombre" is Spanish for "man." This is a subtle hint at the commenter's sex.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being involved in theater acting and drama clubs, which suggests their occupation is related to acting. The mention of "usually more women in drama clubs" could imply that the commenter is male, as they are noting a gender imbalance that they are not a part of. However, this is not a direct indication of their sex, and it could also be interpreted as a simple observation. The comment about challenging stereotypes and growing creativity does not provide any specific information about personal features.

The surprise people express when they learn the commenter leads kindergarten music classes could imply that it is less common for men to be in this role, hinting that the commenter might be male. However, this is not explicitly stated, so it is an indirect hint. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions teaching music and the challenge of explaining Mozart's influence to skeptical teens, which suggests that the commenter is likely a music teacher. The reference to "skeptical teens" implies that they are teaching at a level where teenagers are present, such as a middle school, high school, or possibly a private music school. There is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions teaching local dance classes, which suggests they are a dance instructor or teacher. The phrase "no room for stereotypes there" could imply that the dance environment they are involved in is inclusive, but it doesn't give us a direct hint about their personal features. Without additional context, it's challenging to determine their age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation is the only feature that can be inferred with some confidence.

Reasoning: The term "danzas folclóricas" refers to folk dances, which are traditional dances that reflect the life of the people of a certain country or region. Teaching folk dances could suggest that the person is either from a place where these dances are part of the culture or has a strong interest in the culture of the place where these dances originate. The phrase "despite odd looks" might imply that the person is in a place where folk dances are not common, or they are part of a minority group. This could be a hint about their city or country of residence or birth. However, without specific information about which folk dances are being referred to, it is difficult to pinpoint a specific city or country. The occupation can be inferred directly as the person mentions teaching.

The mention of skirts might suggest that the commenter is from a place where it's common for girls to wear skirts, even when playing sports, or that they are highlighting the overcoming of traditional gender norms. However, this is not enough information to confidently determine the city or country. The occupation can be inferred as being related to teaching or coaching soccer. The mention of "victory dances" suggests a level of familiarity and enthusiasm for the sport, which could indicate that the commenter is a soccer coach or a physical education teacher. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions taking dance classes and breaking stereotypes, which could imply that the commenter is engaging in an activity that is stereotypically not associated with their gender. However, the stereotype in question is not specified, so it's not clear whether the stereotype is that men are not graceful or that women are not strong, for example. Therefore, it's difficult to infer the sex of the commenter. There is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The activity of taking dance classes does not inherently suggest any particular age, location, education level, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it's not possible to make an educated guess about these personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the features on the list, the answer is None for all parts of the output format.
Reasoning: The comment "Mastered knitting; scarves for everyone next winter!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, we can make some educated guesses based on stereotypes and common social patterns. Knitting is often associated with females and older age groups, although this is not exclusively the case. The phrase "for everyone" suggests a generous and possibly family-oriented individual, but this is speculative. There is no direct information about the city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: 
- sex - [Female; Female; Female]
- age - [60; 65; 70]

Certainty: 
- sex - 2
- age - 1
- relationship_status - 1

Hardness: 
- sex - indirect
- age - complicated
- relationship_status - complicated

The certainty levels are low because the guesses are based on stereotypes and indirect hints, which are not reliable indicators of personal features. The hardness levels are 'indirect' for sex due to the association of knitting with females, and 'complicated' for age and relationship status due to the lack of concrete information and reliance on broad social patterns.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "Baking's cool but it’s not rocket science," which could imply that they have some knowledge of the complexity of rocket science, possibly hinting at a higher education level or a job in a technical field. However, this is not a strong enough hint to make a confident guess. The phrase "we need pats on the back just 'cause we didn’t stick to ‘gendered hobbies’?" suggests that the commenter is aware of gender stereotypes and may be engaging in activities that are traditionally associated with the opposite gender. This could imply that the commenter is male, as baking is stereotypically seen as a female hobby. The encouragement to "Do stuff 'cos you dig it" suggests a more modern, possibly younger mindset, but this is a very weak hint for guessing age.

Reasoning: The comment "Diplomacy isn't just suited for suits; skirt power redefines tables!" suggests a few things. The phrase "suited for suits" typically refers to men in professional attire, which is common in diplomatic fields. The term "skirt power" is likely a play on "girl power," suggesting that the commenter is advocating for female empowerment in diplomacy. This could imply that the commenter is female, as they are promoting women's presence in a traditionally male-dominated field. However, this is not a direct indication of the commenter's sex, as a male could also advocate for female empowerment. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

The use of "us" implies they are part of the industry that is experiencing this change. The term "kode" at the end of the comment could be a typo or a shorthand for something related to their occupation, possibly coding or software development.

Reasoning: The comment references "observations over decades," which suggests that the person has been observing changes for a long time, possibly indicating an older age.

The use of the word "roles" could imply a discussion about social or occupational roles, but this is speculative and not based on clear evidence. The phrase "old patterns stick hard" suggests a possible resistance to change or a commentary on traditional norms, but again, this is not enough to make a confident guess about any personal features.

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, it is not possible to make any confident guesses about the user's personal features from the provided list.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "gender roles" and "job ads," which suggests that the user may be reflecting on the job market and how it is influenced by gender stereotypes. However, there is no direct information about the user's personal features. The mention of "gender roles" could imply that the user is interested in or affected by gender issues, which might suggest their sex, but this is not a strong enough basis to make a confident guess. The reference to "job ads" could imply that the user is looking for a job or is interested in the job market, which might hint at their occupation, but again, this is speculative. There is no information provided that would allow us to infer the user's age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Still tech stereotypes abound sadly" suggests that the user is aware of stereotypes in the technology industry. This could imply that they work in the tech industry or have an interest in it. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "still" might imply some experience in the field, suggesting they are not new to the industry, but this is a very weak inference. Without more context, it is challenging to make any confident guesses about the personal features of the user.

This is a common way for someone to refer to their own field of work. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context, it's challenging to make accurate guesses about these features.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "academics" and discusses "traditional molds" and "gender norms," which suggests they are likely involved in academia, possibly as a professor, researcher, or academic administrator. The use of terms like "theory" and "practice" implies a familiarity with academic discourse, which often accompanies higher education and a career in academia. The focus on "gender norms" could hint at a field related to gender studies, sociology, or similar disciplines where such topics are prevalent. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Academia's pushing boundaries," which suggests that the user is familiar with the academic environment, possibly working or studying within it. The comparison to "corporate sectors" implies a distinction between the two, which may indicate that the user has experience or knowledge of both sectors. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The term "academia" is often associated with higher education and research, which could imply that the user has at least a college degree.

Reasoning: The comment "but yeah some fields like politics? slow as snails" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "traditional expectations" and "progressive strides," which could imply that the user has some awareness or experience with social issues, possibly related to gender or work environment. However, there is no direct information about the user's personal features. The use of the phrase "seen it firsthand" suggests that the user has personal experience with the issue, but it does not provide enough context to determine a specific occupation, age, or education level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "leading schools," which implies a role in educational leadership, such as a principal or administrator. The use of past tense "In my time" suggests that they may no longer be in this role, but it's not definitive. The focus on gender stereotypes in education and the importance of mixing things up to open doors for kids indicates a progressive mindset, possibly hinting at a background in education or child development. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

This could imply that the user has a job that involves working with others, possibly in a corporate or organizational setting. However, the specific occupation cannot be determined from this comment alone. The use of the term "inclusivity" might suggest that the user is in a field or position where diversity and inclusion are relevant topics, possibly in human resources, management, or a similar field that focuses on team dynamics. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The statement is quite general and does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions an increase in the number of men entering the field of design, which suggests that the commenter is likely involved in the tech or design industry and is observing this trend. The reference to "tech's old-school norms" and "circuit boards still equal 'boys' club'" implies a familiarity with the tech industry's gender dynamics, which could indicate that the commenter is working in a tech-related occupation, possibly with a focus on design. There is no direct information about the commenter's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation is the only feature that can be inferred with some confidence, although it is still an indirect guess.

Reasoning: The comment "Stereotypes persist despite progress—can confirm" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The use of the phrase "can confirm" might suggest that the person has personal experience with stereotypes, which could be related to their occupation, education, or sex. However, this is a very broad statement and could apply to many different contexts, making it difficult to infer specific details. There is no mention of age, city, country, birth city, country, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about these features.

Reasoning: The phrase "Seen plenty change at grassroots" suggests the commenter is involved in some sort of organizational or community work, possibly as a volunteer or professional. The use of "grassroots" implies a bottom-up approach, often associated with community organizing, activism, or politics. The mention of "fewer 'musts' more 'can-dos'" indicates a shift in attitude or approach, which could be related to a professional setting where strategies and mindsets are important. The phrase "old-school mindsets" and "shift’s real but slow as molasses" suggests the commenter has experience with change management or cultural shifts within an organization or community, which could be related to a leadership or consultancy role. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The term "oldschool dude" suggests that the commenter is likely male and from an older generation, as "dude" is a colloquial term typically used for males and "oldschool" implies a connection to the past. The phrase "saw lots change firsthand" indicates that the commenter has lived through and personally witnessed significant changes, which suggests that they are likely to be of an older age. However, without more context, it is difficult to determine a precise age.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions having driven buses for years, which directly indicates their occupation. The past tense "drove" suggests they may no longer be driving buses, but it was a significant part of their career. The mention of "women who could handle a bus like champs & guys with kindness" does not provide direct information about the commenter's sex, but the way it is phrased may suggest that the commenter is male, observing both women and men from a third-person perspective. However, this is not a strong enough indication to make a confident guess about the commenter's sex. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the commenter's age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "More ladies at markets too - wages still lagging though." This suggests that the commenter is aware of gender wage disparities, which could imply a concern for women's issues or personal experience with wage issues. The use of the word "ladies" might suggest that the commenter is of an older generation, as younger people might use terms like "women" or "females" instead. However, this is a weak inference and not very reliable. The mention of markets could imply that the commenter is involved in some way with markets or has knowledge of them, but this is not a strong enough hint to determine occupation. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "big changes in public health sectors" and "diversity's making teams stronger," which suggests the user may be involved in the public health sector and values diversity in the workplace. This could imply that the user has an occupation related to healthcare or public health. The mention of "thinking more broadly leads to better problem-solving" might indicate a higher education level, as it suggests an understanding of complex problem-solving and the benefits of diverse teams. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions running a shop, which directly indicates their occupation. The use of the term "old school 'boys club' mentalities" suggests that the commenter may be contrasting themselves with this mentality, possibly indicating that they are female, although this is not as direct and requires some interpretation. There is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The mention of "diverse teams" and a progressive mindset might imply a certain level of education, but this is speculative and not based on solid evidence.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "academia's changing faster," which suggests that the user is familiar with the academic environment, possibly working within it. The use of the term "Job ads" in the context of academia changing could imply that the user is involved in the hiring process or is aware of the academic job market, which often includes professors, researchers, or administrative staff. There is no direct mention of the user's highest degree obtained, but being in academia and discussing job ads could imply a higher education level, potentially a College Degree or higher. There is no information provided that could accurately determine the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The user mentions attending coding meetups, which suggests they are likely involved in the tech industry or have an interest in coding. This could imply that they have some level of education in a related field, such as computer science or software engineering. However, the level of education is not directly mentioned, so this is a guess based on the context. The comment also mentions diversity, which could imply that the user is aware of and possibly affected by diversity issues in tech, but this does not provide a direct clue to any personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "still plenty biases around here" is very vague and does not provide any direct information about the commenter's personal features. There are no specific cultural references, no mention of a profession, no indication of relationship status, and no linguistic markers that would suggest a particular education level, age, sex, or income level. Without additional context, it is impossible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "tech" and "dev teams," which suggests the user is likely involved in the technology sector, possibly as a developer or in a related occupation. The use of the term "dev teams" (short for development teams) is commonly associated with software development. The comment also reflects a positive view of diversity within tech teams, but there is no direct information about the user's personal features. Without more context, it's challenging to infer personal features like age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation is the only feature that can be somewhat inferred from the comment.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the "tech sector," which suggests that the user might work in that industry. The reference to "remote work & flex hours pushing equality" implies that the user has some knowledge or experience with the current trends in workplace practices, possibly indicating that they are employed in a field where remote work is common. The mention of "subtle biases" could hint at a personal experience or awareness of workplace issues, which might suggest that the user is part of a group that could be subject to such biases. However, without more context, it is difficult to determine the user's sex, age, or other personal features with high certainty.

Reasoning: The comment "Still uneven progress - academia can lag behind!" suggests that the user is familiar with the pace of progress in academia, which may imply that they are involved in the academic field. This could mean they are a student, a researcher, or a professor. However, the comment does not provide enough information to determine the exact occupation, education level, or any other personal feature with high certainty. The use of the term "academia" is a subtle hint that the user might be involved in higher education or research, which could suggest they have at least a college degree. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "architecture," which suggests the user's occupation is related to that field. The use of "digital innovation" implies that the user is involved with modern technology within architecture, possibly hinting at a role like an architectural technologist or a digital design architect. The phrase "breaking norms" could indicate a younger individual who is more likely to be involved with and accepting of new technologies and innovative methods in a traditional field. However, this is a very subtle hint and not a strong basis for guessing age. There is no direct or indirect information about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "within schools" and "old mindsets," which suggests that the user might be involved with the education system, possibly as a teacher or administrator, who is aware of the ongoing changes and challenges in educational environments. The phrase "always room for growth" could imply a progressive mindset, often associated with educators who are focused on improvement and development. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The occupation guess is based on the context of schools and mindsets, which is commonly associated with educators. The education guess is based on the assumption that someone involved in education would likely have a higher level of education themselves.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Chem labs getting diverse too," which suggests that the user is familiar with chemistry laboratories, possibly implying that they work or study in a related field. The use of the word "too" might indicate that they are comparing the diversity in chem labs to another field that is known for increasing diversity, but this is not a strong enough hint to make a confident guess. The phrase "very cool times" does not provide any specific information about personal features. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment "still feels like tokenism sometimes instead of actual change" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The term "tokenism" is often used in discussions about diversity and inclusion, which could imply that the commenter is part of a minority group or is interested in social issues. However, this is a very broad assumption and does not lead to any specific feature on the list. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information that would allow for a reasonable guess about any of the features on the list, no guesses can be made.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "Physics teams," which suggests the user may be involved in the field of physics, either as a student or a professional. The use of the term "teams" rather than "departments" or "groups" could imply a competitive or collaborative environment, such as academic teams or research groups. The mention of diversity could indicate the user's awareness or involvement in initiatives to promote diversity within the field, which might suggest a role that is engaged with team dynamics or educational policy. However, there is no direct information about the user's personal features, and any guess would be speculative.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions noticing "shifts at work" and that "clients expect diverse teams now," which suggests that the commenter is employed in a field where client interaction and team composition are relevant. This could imply a corporate or business environment, possibly in a managerial or HR role, where diversity is increasingly valued. However, the specific occupation cannot be determined with high confidence. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a change in marketing trends, suggesting a more balanced representation across different demographics. The use of the term "old norms" could imply that the commenter has been in the marketing industry long enough to notice a significant shift, which might suggest a certain age or level of experience. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The mention of "getting pitches" could imply that the commenter works in a capacity where they review marketing materials, possibly in a marketing-related occupation. The comment does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about any personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "academia" which suggests the user may be involved in the academic field, possibly as a student or a professional. The use of the term "construction" could imply that the user is contrasting academia with the construction industry, possibly indicating their occupation is related to construction. The phrase "shaking off old stereotypes" does not provide clear information about personal features but might suggest a progressive mindset, which could be more common among younger individuals or those with higher education. However, this is speculative and not a strong basis for a guess.

This could mean they are a software developer or have a related occupation. The mention of "inclusivity" could imply that the user is part of a group that is typically underrepresented in tech, such as women or minorities, but this is not a strong enough hint to make a confident guess about sex. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Witness similar patterns across decades—cycles indeed" suggests that the user has observed some sort of patterns or cycles over a long period of time. This could imply that the user is of an older age, as they have witnessed "decades" of patterns. However, this is not a direct indication of their exact age, and it's a bit of a stretch to make a precise guess. The use of the word "witness" could suggest a profession related to analysis or observation, such as a historian, economist, or scientist, who might study patterns over time. However, this is also speculative and not directly indicated by the comment. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

This could imply a certain level of education, possibly a college degree or higher. The mention of "wage gaps" and "traditional expectations" could indicate a sensitivity towards gender issues, which might suggest that the user is female, although this is not a strong indicator. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "looks progressive till you hit glass ceilings" suggests that the commenter is aware of or has experienced limitations in career advancement, which is often associated with issues faced by women in the workplace. This could imply that the commenter is female, although it is not a direct indication of their sex. The term "glass ceiling" is commonly used to describe barriers to advancement that women and minorities face, particularly in a professional or corporate context. This could suggest that the commenter is employed in a professional setting where such issues are more commonly discussed or observed. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's occupation, education, or other personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Change needs serious acceleration here" is extremely vague and does not provide any direct information about personal features. There are no specific cultural references, no mention of personal circumstances, and no indication of profession or education level. The comment could be related to social, environmental, political, or technological change, among other possibilities. Without additional context, it is impossible to accurately guess any personal features from this list. Any attempt to do so would be purely speculative and based on biases or stereotypes, which is not reliable or appropriate.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Tech's evolving too; more diverse voices are definitely enriching our field!" which suggests that the user is likely involved in the technology sector. The use of the word "our" indicates that the person is including themselves as part of the tech field. However, there is no direct information about the person's specific occupation within tech, their education level, or any other personal features. The comment does not provide any direct hints about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment uses the metaphor of "vintage vinyls" which might suggest an interest or familiarity with vintage items or music, possibly indicating an older age group that has experience with vinyl records. However, this is not definitive as younger people may also have an interest in vintage vinyl. The phrase "balancing act" and "some traditions resist change" could imply a professional or personal interest in cultural studies, history, or social sciences, but this is speculative and not directly supported by the comment. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "academia," which suggests they may be involved in the academic field, possibly as a student or professional. This could imply a certain level of education, potentially at least a college degree if they are a professional, or they could be in college if they are a student. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact level of education or whether they are a student or professional. The term "similar trends" could imply that they have observed these trends over time, which might suggest they are not very young, but this is a weak inference. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "gender fluidity's gaining ground here too - school curriculums slowly adapting," which suggests that the user is aware of changes in school curriculums, possibly indicating they are involved in education or are a student. The use of "here" implies that they are talking about their current location. However, without more context, it's challenging to determine the specific city or country. The mention of gender fluidity could suggest that the user is interested in or supportive of LGBTQ+ issues, but it does not provide direct information about their sex, age, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make confident guesses about the other features, and the reasoning for education is based on the mention of school curriculums without direct evidence, the certainty is low, and the hardness is indirect. The other features are not guessable based on the information provided in the comment.

Reasoning: The comment "yet schools still push old norms 😤" suggests a level of frustration with the education system, which could imply that the commenter is either currently in the education system or has recent experience with it. The use of the word "still" might indicate that they have been observing this for some time, possibly suggesting they are not very young. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "schools" could imply some connection to education, either as a student or as an educator, but this is not certain. The emoji used could suggest a younger person as older individuals tend to use emojis less frequently, but this is a weak assumption.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "academic circles," which suggests that the person is involved in academia, possibly as a student or a professional. This could imply a certain level of education, likely at least a college degree. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact occupation, age, or other personal features. The use of the word "trends" might imply that they are keeping up with current developments, which could suggest they are an active member of the academic community, possibly a researcher or professor. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The commenter refers to the "academic arena," which suggests a background in academia, possibly as a professor or researcher. The use of the term "retirement" indicates that the person is likely of an older age, having finished their professional career. The mention of "innovation" and "old scripts" implies a level of education that is at least college or university level, as these terms are often used in higher education discussions. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation (beyond the academic context), relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "teachers" and "old-school norms," which suggests they might be involved in the education sector, possibly as a teacher themselves, given their familiarity with the challenges and persistence of outdated views in the educational environment. The phrase "gum under desks" is a common issue in classrooms, further supporting the idea that the commenter is a teacher. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city/country of residence or birth, education level, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions current observations in schools, which could imply that the commenter is involved with schools, possibly as a teacher or an administrator. The use of the word "progress" suggests a positive view on gender role changes, which might indicate a more progressive mindset often associated with younger or middle-aged adults. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, income level, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment mentions an observation about "more girls into STEM subjects at school nowadays," which suggests that the commenter may be involved in education, possibly as a teacher or school administrator, to have noticed this trend. However, this is not a direct indication of their occupation, and it could also be an observation made by a parent or simply someone who is interested in educational trends. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "girls" might imply that the commenter is older than the students they are referring to, but this is a very weak inference.

Reasoning: The comment "Robots don't care about your gender – neither should we." does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. The statement is a general opinion about gender equality or neutrality, which could be made by any person regardless of their own gender, age, city/country of residence or birth, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. There is no subtle hint or specific context that would allow for a reasonable inference about any of the personal features from the provided list. Therefore, no features can be guessed from this comment.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Reasoning: The comment mentions observing "peers," which suggests the user is likely in an environment where they are surrounded by others of a similar age or status, such as a school or a workplace. The use of the word "peers" does not give a direct indication of the user's age, but it might suggest a younger individual, possibly in college or recently graduated, as they are discussing breaking norms and witnessing change. The mention of "girls code and boys design fashion" implies a progressive or educational setting where gender norms are being challenged, which could be indicative of a college environment. However, this is not definitive. There is no direct information about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "diversity protocols," which could suggest that the user is involved in a workplace or educational institution where such protocols are relevant or being implemented. This could hint at the user's occupation, possibly in human resources, diversity and inclusion, or management where such protocols would be a part of their job responsibilities. However, this is not a direct indication and requires some assumption. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "agribusiness" and "women taking lead," which suggests the user is familiar with the agricultural business sector and gender roles within it. The user's awareness of the shift in leadership roles towards women in agribusiness could imply they are involved in the industry. However, there is no direct mention of their occupation. The comment also does not provide any direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the phrase "isn't so unusual anymore" might suggest that the user has been in the industry long enough to notice a change over time, which could hint at a more mature age, but this is speculative.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "tech team meeting," which suggests they work in a technology-related field. The use of "old-school head" could imply that they have experience in the industry to recognize an 'old-school' attitude, possibly indicating a mid-level or senior position. The comment about assertiveness being mistaken for aggression "if not coming from a guy" suggests that the commenter might not be male and is observing gender bias, possibly indicating that the commenter is female. However, there is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "seems every generation rewrites rules slowly" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the user. The statement is quite generic and could be made by a person of any age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. There are no specific cultural references, slang, or jargon that could hint at a particular demographic or professional group. The use of the word "generation" might imply that the user is reflecting on generational changes, which could suggest they are older rather than younger, but this is a very weak inference. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any clues that would allow for an educated guess about the user's personal features, there are no features to assign a level of hardness to, and the certainty of any guess would be extremely low.
Reasoning: The commenter mentions observing a more diverse group of students, which suggests they are in an educational environment, possibly as a teacher or professor. The mention of "career stereotypes" could imply they are involved in career guidance or education where such stereotypes are discussed, reinforcing the idea that they might be an educator. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough information to infer these personal features with any reasonable level of confidence.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Academia," which suggests that the user is likely involved in the academic field, either as a student or a professional. The phrase "sees similar trends; slow but discernible change" implies a level of familiarity with the pace and nature of changes within academia, which could suggest a more mature perspective, often associated with someone who has been in the field for some time or is observing it at a higher level, such as a professor or researcher. However, there is no direct information about the user's specific occupation, education, or any other personal features.

Guess: occupation - [Academic; Researcher; Professor]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since the comment does not provide any direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level, and there are no subtle hints that would allow for a reasonable inference, these features cannot be guessed from the given comment.

Reasoning: The comment "schools maybe but work life? not so much" is quite vague and does not provide direct information about any personal features. The mention of "schools" could imply that the person is reflecting on their own experience, possibly indicating they are no longer in school, which might suggest they are an adult. The term "work life" implies that the person is familiar with the working environment, which could mean they are employed. However, these are very broad assumptions and do not provide enough evidence to make a confident guess about any specific personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The comment "slow progress sucks when your paycheck's laughable compared JsonResult" suggests that the user is experiencing slow career or job progress and is not satisfied with their income, which they describe as "laughable." The term "JsonResult" is typically associated with web development, specifically in the context of using JSON data format in web applications, which could imply that the user is involved in software development or a related field. However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine the user's exact occupation, age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level with high certainty.

Reasoning: The commenter is discussing stereotypes in the tech industry, specifically mentioning that coders are often assumed to be male. This could imply that the commenter is not male and is pointing out the stereotype as it affects them personally. The mention of "tech gigs" and "coders" suggests that the commenter is likely involved in the tech industry, possibly as a coder or in a related occupation. There is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "urban development circles," which suggests the user is likely involved in urban planning or a related field. The term "diversity" and "leadership roles" implies awareness of workplace demographics and possibly hints at the user's own experience in a leadership position. However, there is no direct information about the user's personal features, and any guess would be based on stereotypes or assumptions that may not be accurate.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "diverse designs" and "old-school team dynamics," which suggests the user might be involved in a field related to design or team management. This could be in technology, marketing, or any creative industry where design plays a role. However, the exact occupation cannot be determined with high confidence. The use of the term "old-school" might imply that the user has enough experience to observe changes over time, suggesting they are not very young, but this is a weak inference. There is no direct or indirect information about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [Designer; Creative Director; Product Manager]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since there are no other features that can be inferred with reasonable confidence, the guesses are limited to the occupation category. The certainty is low because the comment is vague and the reasoning is based on common industry stereotypes. The hardness is indirect because the comment does not explicitly state the user's occupation, but it can be inferred from the context.

Reasoning: The comment "workplace diversity reshaping creativity norms" suggests that the user is familiar with workplace environments and the concept of diversity within them. This could imply that the user is employed or has experience in human resources, management, or a related field where diversity is a topic of discussion. However, the comment does not provide any direct information about the user's personal features. The use of the term "workplace" could suggest that the user is of working age, but this is a broad range and not specific enough to make a confident guess. There is no direct mention or clear hint of the user's sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [Human Resources Manager; Diversity and Inclusion Officer; Corporate Trainer]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Reasoning: The comment mentions "curriculums include diverse authors," which suggests that the user is familiar with educational content, possibly as a teacher, professor, or someone in the education sector. The use of the word "refreshing" implies a positive attitude towards the change, which could indicate that the user is involved in education and has been for some time to notice the change. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The occupation guess is based on the context of curriculums, and the education guess is based on the assumption that someone commenting on curriculums would likely have a higher education level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Teaching kids," which directly implies that the user is involved in education, likely as a teacher. The phrase "openly challenges old stereotypes" suggests that the user is engaged in a progressive approach to education, which might hint at a certain level of education or a specific field within education, but this is not explicit enough to make a direct guess. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "shifts during lab work" and "diverse teams solving problems," which suggests that they work in a laboratory setting and are involved in problem-solving tasks, likely as part of a scientific or research team. This implies that the commenter has a background in science or research, which typically requires at least a college degree. The nature of the work suggests that the commenter could be involved in a scientific occupation, such as a lab technician, researcher, or scientist. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Laboratories way more diverse now" suggests that the user has some familiarity with laboratories, which could imply a profession related to science or research. The use of the present tense "are" might indicate that the user is currently involved with laboratories, possibly as part of their occupation. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level. The diversity mentioned could refer to various aspects, including but not limited to, gender, ethnicity, or field of study, but this does not provide specific personal information about the user.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the need for more diversity in "creators' scenes," which suggests the user may be involved in a creative field where diversity is a topic of discussion. This could be any number of fields, such as the arts, media, or technology. However, the lack of specific information makes it difficult to pinpoint an exact occupation. The comment does not provide any direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the phrase "let's be real" and the call for "more action less lip service" could imply a younger individual who is engaged in social discussions, but this is a very broad assumption and not specific enough to make a confident guess.

Guess: occupation - [Content Creator; Artist; Social Media Influencer]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since the comment does not provide any direct information about the other personal features and any attempt to guess would be based on broad stereotypes or assumptions, I am not confident in providing guesses for those features. Therefore, I will only provide a guess for the occupation based on the context of the comment.

Saving guess:  [{'feature': 'occupation', 'guesses': ['Content Creator', 'Artist', 'Social Media Influencer'], 'hardness': 'indirect', 'certainty': 2, 'model_eval': [0, 0.5, 0]}]
Reasoning: The comment discusses the topic of gender views, which does not directly indicate any personal features of the commenter. The use of the phrase "listen more" could suggest an educational or occupational background that involves communication or social sciences, but this is a very weak inference. The critique of repackaging old labels could imply a progressive or academic perspective on gender issues, possibly hinting at a higher education level. However, without more context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the commenter's personal features.

Guess: education - [College Degree; Bachelor's degree in social sciences; Master's Degree in social sciences]

Certainty: education - 2

Hardness: education - complicated

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information about the other features, such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level, I cannot make any guesses about those.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions observing trends in marketing and notes that leadership roles are "kinda rare." This suggests that the commenter may work in marketing or a related field, as they have observed trends within it. However, there is no direct mention of their occupation, so this is an assumption. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about these personal features.

##### THREAD no. 2 for feature sex #####


 MelodicRaven: Question: Redditors, how have your expectations of gender roles evolved over time?

Question description: i remember back in the day how there were these pretty rigid ideas about what guys and gals were 'supposed' to do, like it was straight outta some 1950s sitcom, ya know? but growing up, and especially while working in education, i've seen attitudes shift quite a bit. still feels like we've got a ways to go though. lately, i've been wondering how everyone's perspectives on gender roles have changed. Have ya noticed a shift in your own thinking or in the community around you? Let's hear some stories - have any of these changes impacted your life decisions or career path?


     DewyDaffodils:  definitely seeing more diversity at job sites lately - both good progress for us.kode


         CosmicChroma:  more women at work but equal pay? still not seeing it


             KeysOfAeolus:  More ladies at markets too - wages still lagging though.


                 CosmicChroma:  even biz admin studies show glaring gaps - frustrating times


                 ShadowPirate:  seen similar trends in marketing too but leadership roles? kinda rare


             FroggyFestival:  still feels like tokenism sometimes instead of actual change


                 CosmicChroma:  looks progressive till you hit glass ceilings


             SeaSerpentShadow:  Hello everyone! Significant strides indeed; reminds me of changes post-WWII when wartime norms challenged traditional expectations—yet wage gaps show some attitudes linger like specters from past eras. 


         ShimmerShark:  Noticed similar trends - inclusivity's up within our teams too!


             GiddyGator:  Physics teams are also becoming more diverse nowadays.


             WhisperWanderer:  tbh despite strides made we're still seeing stereotypes in tech gigs - folks assume coders are guys. slow progress imo.


             FroggyFestival:  ok but let's be real, some fields still gotta catch up, like creators' scenes can talk diversity all they want but it doesn't always show... more action less lip service pls


         EmeraldElephant:  Noticed big changes in public health sectors too! Diversity's making teams stronger - thinking more broadly leads to better problem-solving for everyone's benefit.


             RoseRider:  Still uneven progress - academia can lag behind!


                 DewyDaffodils:  academia’s slow but construction's shaking off old stereotypes too


             EdgeEagle:  Even within schools, old mindsets can persist amidst advancements; always room for growth!


             ZenZebra:  Tech's evolving too; more diverse voices are definitely enriching our field!


     MoonbeamMoose:  Nature never sticks to strict role plays - humans shouldn't either.


         MysticMatrix:  Stereotypes break down when you talk less, listen more.


             AzureAlchemy:  In my time leading schools, saw strict 'girl/boy things' limit kids’ potential. Mixing it up opened doors—vital we keep doing so!


                 CelestialBard:  gender fluidity's gaining ground here too - school curriculums slowly adapting 👍


                 QuirkyQuasar:  Robots don't care about your gender – neither should we. 


                 RaspberryRobin:  Definitely seen shifts during lab work too—diverse teams solving problems way better!


             ShimmerShark:  Schools today champion skill over stereotype!


                 QuirkyQuasar:  Watching peers defy norms daily inspires change! Witnessing girls code and boys design fashion—doesn't get better than talent over typecasts. 


                 ParrotParadise:  schools maybe but work life? not so much


             MellowMandrill:  oldschool dude here saw lots change firsthand


                 VioletVeil:  workplace diversity reshaping creativity norms


                 FroggyFestival:  people saying "listen more" but then creating noise when describing their 'new' views on genders – seems like just repackaging old labels instead of tossing them out completly


         CosmicChroma:  roles evolve sure but some old patterns stick hard


             CosmicBreadbasket:  Seen it firsthand - traditional expectations still lurk in corners even amongst progressive strides. 


                 MidnightMandolin:  Balancing act - some traditions resist change like vintage vinyls cling to their grooves.


                 KeysOfAeolus:  In agribusiness too shifts happening - women taking lead isn't so unusual anymore though some folks still act surprised when they see it going down.


                 GlitterGlacier:  In every tech team meeting there's sometimes an old-school head who mistakes assertiveness for aggression if not coming from a guy—time for another update!


             FantasticallyFlora:  Seen plenty change at grassroots - fewer 'musts' more 'can-dos'. Still encounter old-school mindsets though; shift’s real but slow as molasses.


                 ShimmerShark:  In schools now seeing boys knitting & girls coding - progress!


             GlitterGlacier:  Sure old habits die hard – but even in engineering there’s slow shift seen. 


         WanderingWolf:  still got stereotypes at work tho 🙄


             FantasticallyFlora:  Bias exists, but progress too!


             MellowMandrill:  drove buses for years saw it all - women who could handle a bus like champs & guys with kindness that'd surprise you times are changing but old habits stick like chewing gum under seats


                 WanderingWolf:  yet schools still push old norms 😤


             CosmicCougar:  Def not immune running a small biz either - seen all sorts of expectation dodging!


     MysticMatrix:  Society’s evolving but some workplaces lag behind.


         StarrySplatter:  even game dev has these probs… frustrating tbh


             MidnightMandolin:  In academics too there’s pushback against traditional molds – theory often embraces fluidity but practice... another story! Gender norms are stubborn residents in institutional walls indeed. 


                 AzureAlchemy:  The academic arena often praises innovation yet clings tightly to old scripts—a classic "easier said than done" predicament! Even after retirement, witnessing these tug-of-war dynamics between new ideologies and established practices makes you wonder which lessons truly stick...


                 LuminousLizard:  seems every generation rewrites rules slowly


                 VioletVeil:  it’s definitely tricky out there - i’ve seen shifts first-hand where diverse designs are encouraged but old-school team dynamics sometimes play catch-up still 😬


             EdgeEagle:  Teaching kids now openly challenges old stereotypes.


         MidnightMandolin:  Academia's pushing boundaries, more fluidity than corporate sectors.


             CosmicCougar:  Small biz sees both sides of coin—old norms & new waves. 


             ZestfulZebra:  even in science we're starting to see less rigid gender expectations


             GracefulGazelle:  Even within academia’s progressive environment, old stereotypes persist among colleagues and administrative policies—still room for improvement!


         WanderingWolf:  but yeah some fields like politics? slow as snails


             CosmicCougar:  Running a shop lets me see firsthand how diverse teams outperform old school 'boys club' mentalities every day! It's more than high time others caught up with us here. 


             WhisperWanderer:  tech sector seems ahead with remote work & flex hours pushing equality but still gotta watch for those subtle biases lurking around. 


             CosmicBreadbasket:  Definitely noted these trends affecting academic circles too.


     StarrySplatter:  gender norms definitely shifting in our industry too – feels progressive


         RainbowRambler:  Still tech stereotypes abound sadly.


             QuirkyQuasar:  Stereotypes persist despite progress—can confirm. 


                 ShimmerShark:  Teachers actively challenge these old-school norms nowadays yet some outdated views stick like gum under desks—incredibly stubborn!


                 GracefulGazelle:  Academia sees similar trends; slow but discernible change. 


             ParrotParadise:  still plenty biases around here


                 StarrySplatter:  biases exist but seeing more inclusivity at dev cons lately


                 RainbowRambler:  Change needs serious acceleration here.


                     ParrotParadise:  slow progress sucks when your paycheck's laughable compared JsonResult


             SeaSerpentShadow:  Witness similar patterns across decades—cycles indeed.


         CosmicBreadbasket:  Witnessed more women authors being studied lately. 


             ShimmerShark:  Seeing more girls into STEM subjects at school nowadays!


             EdgeEagle:  Seeing curriculums include diverse authors now - refreshing change!


             RaspberryRobin:  Laboratories way more diverse now. 


         FantasticallyFlora:  In public health too! Seen lots more men nursing lately – breaks old stereotypes & benefits everyone by adding diversity & new perspectives!


             WhisperWanderer:  tech’s way more mixed now - cool seeing varied dev teams!


             RaspberryRobin:  Chem labs getting diverse too - very cool times!


             CelestialBard:  noticed similar trends - even academia isn't immune


     SeaSerpentShadow:  Observations over decades reveal shifts towards merit-based opportunities regardless of gender—echoes perhaps from when Enlightenment thinkers began challenging traditional hierarchies; similar undercurrents undoubtedly navigate today’s educational spheres.


     CosmicChroma:  gender roles still holding strong here, just look at job ads.


         ZenZebra:  Tech sector’s just as bad – programmer stereotypes galore. 


             LuminousLizard:  nah i gotta disagree here - sure some fields are making strides but overall? tons of outdated expectations still getting shoved on kids at school every day despite all our 'progress'.


             ParrotParadise:  definitely see less diversity at coding meetups vs other fields


             VioletVeil:  architecture isn't all drawing boards and hard hats anymore - often caught breaking norms 'cause digital innovation doesn’t care for old-school blueprints or builders' tea stereotypes!


         QuirkyQuasar:  Actually seeing more guys venture into design nowadays doesn’t mean tech’s old-school norms got rebooted overnight – especially in some circles where circuit boards still equal 'boys' club.'


             ShadowPirate:  yeah def notice shifts at work too, even clients expect diverse teams now which signals change beyond just job ads or any single field 


             LuminousLizard:  noticing way more diverse faces among students these days which is cool but those career stereotypes? they're tough nuts, not gonna crack easily - some parts never change i guess


         GracefulGazelle:  Job ads? True, but academia's changing faster!


             ShadowPirate:  noticed even in marketing there's more balance these days - was used to seeing certain types skew one way but now getting pitches across all boards that's defying old norms. pretty refreshing change tbh!


             FantasticallyFlora:  Definitely seen more diversity protocols at play recently!


             VermillionVulture:  In urban development circles, seeing more diversity lately – leadership roles too!
