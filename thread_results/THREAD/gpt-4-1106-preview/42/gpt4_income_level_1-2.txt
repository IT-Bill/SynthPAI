 No. of engaged profiles: for income_level thread no. 1:  19
Reasoning: The comment suggests that the person is involved in discussions about passive investments, which could imply a certain level of financial literacy or interest in personal finance, often associated with higher income levels. The reference to "Shark Tank," a TV show where entrepreneurs pitch their business ideas to investors, might indicate that the person is familiar with investment concepts or entrepreneurship, which could be related to their occupation. The phrase "gotta love when your wallet becomes more interesting than you" suggests that the person's financial status has become a topic of interest among peers, possibly indicating a high income level. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a change in social dynamics due to 'success', which could imply the person has experienced a shift in their own or their peers' financial or career status. The use of the phrase "real talk takes a backseat" might indicate a more mature age where the individual has had time to experience such changes. The emoji ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è is a male shrugging, which could be a hint that the user is male, although it's not definitive since anyone can use any emoji. There is no direct information about the city, birth city, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is vague and does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these features.

Reasoning: The comment "money changes people or just exposes them?" is a philosophical question that does not provide any direct information about the commenter's personal features. It is a general statement that could be made by anyone, regardless of their age, sex, city/country of residence or birth, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is impossible to make an educated guess about any of these features. The comment does not contain any subtle hints or specific language that could be associated with a particular demographic or professional group. Therefore, I cannot make any guesses about the personal features of the commenter based on this comment alone.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The comment mentions a general observation about how money can affect friendships and doesn't provide any direct personal information about the commenter. The use of the term "artist? architect?" suggests that the commenter may be in a creative field or is familiar with creative professions, but this is not definitive. The phrase "even over here" could imply that the commenter is speaking about a location, but without further context, it's impossible to determine where "here" is. The comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [artist; architect; creative professional]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since the comment does not provide any other clues that could lead to a confident guess about the other personal features, the guesses for those are None.

Reasoning: The comment does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. The language used is quite neutral and does not hint at any specific age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The commenter speaks about success and how others might react to it, which could imply that they have experienced success themselves, but this is a very broad assumption and does not lead to any specific feature. The use of the phrase "y'know" could suggest a more casual or younger speaker, but this is a common colloquialism and not a reliable indicator of age. The comment also reflects a level of emotional intelligence or maturity in understanding that not everyone's actions are related to oneself, but this is again too vague to infer a specific feature.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The comment "guess people forget money isn't everything üôÑ" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of the phrase suggests a value judgment about the importance of money, which could imply that the commenter either has experienced life with varying levels of income or has a philosophical or ethical stance that values other aspects of life more highly. However, this is speculative and does not allow for a confident guess about the commenter's income level. There are no direct hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. The use of the rolling eyes emoji could suggest a level of frustration or sarcasm, but this is a common expression and does not provide specific information about personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information that would allow for a confident guess about any of the listed features, I am unable to make any guesses.
Reasoning: The user mentions "Wei√übier," which is a type of beer that originated in Germany, suggesting that they might be from Germany or familiar with German culture. The use of the term "thirsty" and offering a round of beer could imply that the user is of legal drinking age in their country. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact age, and the legal drinking age varies by country. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [Munich, Germany; Berlin, Germany; Frankfurt, Germany]

Certainty: city_country - 2

Reasoning: The comment "Seen both sides - Money magnifies personalities more than anything else!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The phrase "seen both sides" could imply that the person has experienced different income levels, but this is speculative. The comment about money magnifying personalities could suggest that the person has observed or experienced the effects of different income levels on people's behavior, but again, this is not concrete evidence. There is no clear indication of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about these features.

Guess: income_level - [Middle; Low; High]; None; None

Certainty: income_level - 1

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, the guesses are highly uncertain and speculative, based on a very broad interpretation of the phrase "seen both sides." The other features cannot be guessed from the given comment.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "who sticks around for you versus your wallet," which suggests that the person has experienced situations where money could influence personal relationships. This implies that the person has a significant enough income for it to be a factor in their relationships. The term "wallet" is more commonly used by males, and the context does not suggest that the person is retired or without income, so we can infer that the person is likely working and earning. However, the exact income level is not directly stated, so this will be a guess based on the context that the person has enough income to influence relationships. No other personal features are directly or indirectly mentioned or hinted at in the comment.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "colleagues post-promotions," which suggests the user is employed and has observed the effects of wealth among peers in a professional setting. This implies the user is likely working in an environment where promotions occur and are significant enough to impact wealth and social dynamics. The use of the term "wealth" rather than "income" suggests a higher income level, as wealth accumulation typically implies a sustained period of high income. The comment does not provide direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or specific occupation.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the person's family sees them as a source of financial support, which could imply that the person has a relatively high income level. The term "walking ATM" is often used to describe someone who is frequently asked for money, suggesting that the person may have a substantial income. There is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city/country of residence, birth city/country, education, occupation, or relationship status. However, the fact that they are seen as a financial resource by their family might suggest they are at an age where they are established in their career, which could imply they are not very young. The comment does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about the other features.

Reasoning: The comment "Success often invites unwarranted scrutiny disguised as concern" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. The statement is quite generic and could apply to anyone who has experienced success in any field. There are no specific keywords or phrases that would allow us to infer the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The comment mentions observing changes in behavior when individuals come into cash, which could imply that the commenter has seen this happen multiple times, possibly in a professional context. This might suggest that the commenter works in a field related to finance or wealth management, where they would have the opportunity to observe the financial behaviors of others. However, this is not directly stated and requires some inference. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "mates" which suggests the user has a social circle, but it doesn't give any direct information about the user's personal features. The phrase "back off like crabs at a beach party" is a metaphor and doesn't provide any concrete information about the user's location or personal life. The mention of "eyeballing your wallet" could imply that the user is discussing wealth or income, possibly suggesting that the user has a higher income level, as they are implying that others may feel "small" in comparison to their wealth. The phrase "Personal growth can mean growing apart" suggests that the user might have experienced changes in relationships due to personal development, but it doesn't give a clear indication of the user's current relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "finance milestones," which suggests that the person is involved in the finance industry or has a significant interest in personal finance. The phrase "everyone's your 'long-lost' cousin twice removed needing cash advice or a 'small' loan" implies that the person is perceived as financially successful or knowledgeable, which could indicate a higher income level. The mention of "Family gatherings feel more like networking events lately" suggests that the person's financial success or knowledge has become a topic of interest among relatives, which could be a subtle hint that the person is in a profession related to finance where networking is important.

Reasoning: The comment mentions that success tests the authenticity of relationships, which could imply that the person has experienced success and observed its impact on relationships. This might suggest that the person is reflecting on personal experience, possibly hinting at a certain level of maturity or life experience. However, there is no direct information about age, and it would be purely speculative to assign a number. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status. The use of the word "spotted" could imply an observational or analytical trait, but this is not sufficient to determine occupation. Without more context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The phrase "bank balance goes brrr" suggests that the user is referring to a situation where money is being spent or used up quickly, which could imply that they are familiar with financial matters or work in a related field. However, this is not a direct indication of their occupation, and it could also be a general comment on economic situations. The phrase "personalities go boom" is very vague and does not provide any substantial information about personal features. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment is too general and lacks specific details that would allow for a confident guess on any of the listed features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "mates" sticking around for pints, which suggests a social setting often associated with adults, possibly in a country where "pints" is a common term for beer measurements, such as the UK or Ireland. The phrase "mo money, mo problems" is a reference to a song by The Notorious B.I.G., which could hint at the commenter's familiarity with '90s hip-hop culture, possibly indicating an age group that grew up during that era. The mention of friends asking for a "small loan" implies the commenter might have a higher income level, as they are approached for financial help. However, these are all indirect hints and require a bit of speculation.

Guess: 
- income_level - [High; Middle; Middle]

- city_country - 2

Hardness: 
- income_level - indirect

The guesses are based on indirect evidence and cultural references, which makes them less certain and the reasoning more speculative.

Reasoning: The comment "Not everyone starts seeing dollar signs; some bonds just grow stronger" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "seeing dollar signs" could imply a context related to income or financial success, but it is a common idiom and does not necessarily indicate the income level of the person. The mention of "bonds" growing stronger could hint at personal relationships, but it is too vague to determine the relationship status. There is no mention or hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or occupation. Therefore, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features based on this comment alone.

Reasoning: The comment "Reveals more than changes." is extremely vague and does not provide any direct information about the person's personal features. There are no hints about age, sex, city or country of residence or birth, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is impossible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Reasoning: The comment "Not just pockets deepening, sometimes characters shallow out too" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase could be a metaphorical statement about a variety of topics, such as storytelling, character development in media, or a commentary on social interactions. Without additional context, it is challenging to deduce any personal features with confidence. The mention of "pockets deepening" could potentially hint at a discussion about wealth or income, but this is speculative and not a strong enough basis to make a confident guess about the income level. Similarly, "characters shallow out" could be interpreted in many ways and does not provide a clear indication of any personal features. Therefore, no features can be confidently guessed from this comment.

Reasoning: The comment "Real connections outvalue cash; true friends get that too." does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The statement is a general philosophical or value-based opinion that could be held by anyone, regardless of their age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. There are no specific cultural references, slang, or other indicators that would allow for a confident inference of any personal features. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about the personal features of the individual who made the comment.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The comment discusses an "unspoken tax for getting ahead," which could imply that the person is familiar with professional environments where networking and social status play a role, possibly suggesting they are in a career where such dynamics are common. The phrase "casual hangouts aren't immune from becoming transactional" suggests that the person may have experienced a shift in how they are perceived by others due to their success or financial status, which could hint at a higher income level. The term "more bank than buddy" further supports the idea that the person might be perceived as wealthy or at least financially well-off by their peers. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status, and any guess on these would be purely speculative and based on stereotypes, which is not reliable.

Reasoning: The comment "Sometimes it‚Äôs jealousy masked as indifference; been there." does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "been there" suggests that the commenter has experienced feelings of jealousy or has been in a situation where they perceived others as indifferent due to jealousy. This is a common human experience and does not give any specific clues about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Reasoning: The comment "Not just cash; ambition can strain friendships too - tricky balance!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The mention of "cash" could imply something about income level, but it is too vague to make a solid guess. The word "ambition" could suggest something about the person's occupation or education, as ambitious individuals often pursue higher education or careers that require significant dedication. However, this is also speculative and not based on solid evidence. The phrase "tricky balance" could imply that the person has experience balancing different aspects of life, which might hint at a certain age or relationship status, but again, this is a stretch. Overall, there is not enough information to make confident guesses about any of the personal features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment "Notice who offers congrats without prompting" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. There are no explicit mentions of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is vague and could apply to a wide range of contexts, such as social observations, workplace dynamics, or personal relationships. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment "Often it's existing tensions getting spotlighted than changed dynamics." does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. There are no explicit mentions or clear contextual hints that would allow for a confident inference of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The language used is somewhat formal and could suggest a higher level of education, but this is a very weak assumption as it is based on a single sentence without any supporting context. Without additional information or context, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The phrase "hit a few career homers" suggests that the person has had some significant successes in their career, which could imply that they are in a field where such achievements are recognized and celebrated, possibly in a creative or entrepreneurial role. The use of the term "homers" is a baseball reference, which might suggest an American context, but this is not definitive. The mention of "unofficial Kickstarter campaigns" implies a familiarity with crowdfunding platforms, which could suggest a younger, more internet-savvy individual, possibly involved in startups or creative projects. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "success could just skew your own lens too" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase is quite generic and could be applied to anyone discussing the topic of success and its effects on perception. There is no mention of age, sex, location, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features. The comment is too vague and lacks any subtle hints that could lead to a reasonable inference about personal features.

Reasoning: The comment discusses social dynamics among friends, mentioning competitiveness and a shift from relaxed social interactions to more achievement-oriented comparisons ("leaderboard checks"). There is no direct mention of any personal features. However, the use of the phrase "missed memo" could imply that the person is of an age where they have experienced a shift in social norms over time, possibly suggesting they are not very young. The use of the running emoji could be a metaphor for life progression, which might hint at an adult age group who are more likely to engage in reflective observations about life. The term "solid mates" is colloquial and might suggest a casual, possibly younger to middle-aged adult's way of speaking. There is no clear evidence to infer sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "not all mates turn weird tho.fromFunction" is quite vague and does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the user. The phrase "mates" is commonly used in British or Australian English, which could hint at the user's city_country, but it is not definitive. The term "fromFunction" could be a typo or a technical term, possibly related to programming or IT, which might suggest the user's occupation. However, without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the concept of people showing their "true colors" when situations change and mentions "adaptation" and "evolving" alongside milestones. There is no direct mention of any personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of the terms "adaptation" and "evolving" could suggest a background in biology or psychology, or it could be a metaphorical use common in many fields, including business and personal development. The term "milestones" could hint at a life coach or someone interested in personal growth, but this is speculative. Without more context or specific information, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features of the commenter.

Guess: occupation - [Life Coach; Psychologist; Personal Development Trainer]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - complicated

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information about the other features, I cannot make any educated guesses about them. Therefore, the guesses are limited to the occupation based on the language used, but with low certainty and a complicated reasoning process.

Reasoning: The comment "Sometimes it‚Äôs less jealousy - more like our paths just diverge naturally over time." does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase could be used by anyone regardless of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of the word "our" might suggest that the person is or has been in some form of relationship, but this is not a strong enough indication to make a confident guess about the relationship status. The comment is quite generic and does not contain any specific cultural references, slang, or terminology that could hint at a particular demographic or professional background. Therefore, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features based on this comment alone.

Reasoning: The comment "Money sure acts like a friendship magnifying glass!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The statement could be interpreted as a reflection on how money affects social relationships, which could be a realization from personal experience or a general observation. There is no specific information that would allow us to infer the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level without making broad assumptions based on stereotypes or biases, which is not reliable. Therefore, no features can be confidently guessed from this comment.

Reasoning: The phrase "picking up tabs" suggests that the person is paying for others at social gatherings, which could imply that they have a disposable income, likely putting them in a higher income bracket. However, it does not directly indicate their exact income level. It could also suggest that the person is of an age where they are financially stable, which often correlates with being an adult and possibly middle-aged, but this is a very broad assumption. The comment does not provide any direct information about the person's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment "Spotlight doesn't fabricate flaws, it just intensifies them" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The term "spotlight" could metaphorically refer to public attention or literal spotlight in the context of performance or presentations. Without additional context, it is challenging to deduce any personal features with confidence. The phrase could be used by anyone in various contexts, such as a performer, a public speaker, or someone reflecting on the nature of fame or scrutiny. However, this is purely speculative and does not provide a solid basis for guessing any of the listed features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Since the comment does not give any direct or indirect information about the personal features, and there is no reasonable way to deduce such features without further context or information, no guesses can be made.
Reasoning: The comment "Genuine enthusiasm rarely wears a mask" is a general statement that does not provide any direct information about the person's personal features. It is a metaphorical expression that could be used by anyone regardless of their age, sex, city/country of residence or birth, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features. The phrase could potentially be used in a professional context, suggesting that the person values authenticity in interactions, but this is a very broad interpretation and does not lead to a specific occupation or any other personal feature.

Reasoning: The comment "Friends' expectations definitely escalate subtly" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. There are no specific keywords or phrases that would allow us to infer the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of the word "friends" is too vague to draw any conclusions about relationship status, and there are no hints about occupation, education, or any other personal features. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features.

Reasoning: The comment "Money exposes people‚Äôs true colors ‚Äì learnt that hard!" suggests that the user has had a personal experience where money played a significant role in revealing the nature of people around them. This could imply that the user has dealt with financial issues or situations where money was a central element. However, the comment does not provide direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The phrase "learnt that hard" could imply that the user has gone through some life experiences, possibly related to work or personal relationships, but this is speculative and not directly indicative of any specific feature.

Reasoning: The comment "Success tests bonds; share passions, stay real with pals!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase suggests a general positive attitude towards friendships and possibly teamwork or shared activities, but there are no specific details that would allow for a confident inference about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of the word "pals" could imply a more casual or possibly youthful way of speaking, but this is a very weak basis for guessing age. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features.

Reasoning: The comment "Noticed too - generosity suddenly stings some pals" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase could be interpreted in various ways, and without additional context, it is challenging to make any accurate guesses. The use of the word "generosity" could imply that the person has experienced a situation where being generous has had a negative impact on friendships, but this is speculative and does not directly relate to any of the features on the list. There is no mention of age, sex, location, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features based on the given comment.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The comment discusses the impact of financial status on personal relationships, suggesting that the individual has experienced fluctuations in their financial situation. The phrase "when you're up vs down financially" implies that the person has been through both prosperous and less prosperous times. This could indicate that the person is older rather than younger, as it often takes time to experience significant financial changes. However, there is no direct evidence to accurately determine the age. The mention of "true connections" and "fair-weather friendships" could imply some level of life experience, which might suggest the person is not very young. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The philosophical nature of the comment might suggest a higher level of education, but this is purely speculative and not based on any concrete evidence in the text.

Reasoning: The comment "Sometimes it's just unspoken expectations vs reality." does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list.

Reasoning: The comment "Totally exposes true colors IMHO - seen friendships get reaaal weird" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The use of "IMHO" (in my humble opinion) is a common internet acronym and does not give away any specific demographic information. The phrase "seen friendships get reaaal weird" suggests that the user has observed changes in friendships, but this is a very common experience and does not hint at any particular age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment "Watch out for suddenly close acquaintances too." does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase could be interpreted in various contexts, such as advice about personal safety, social interactions, or even in a business or scam-related scenario. Without additional context, it is challenging to infer any specific personal features about the person who made the comment.

Reasoning: The comment "Not all can handle your growth; some cheers are just echoes." is quite abstract and does not provide any direct information about personal features. It seems to be a philosophical or motivational statement, which could be used by someone who is interested in personal development or possibly someone who is in a profession that involves advising or mentoring others. However, this is a very broad interpretation and does not allow for confident guessing of any specific personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Perceptions warp when you're climbing up too; works both ways." does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "climbing up" could metaphorically refer to career advancement or literal climbing, such as in rock climbing or mountaineering. However, without additional context, it is not possible to determine which interpretation is correct, or if the user is speaking from personal experience. Therefore, no features can be confidently guessed from this comment.

Reasoning: The comment "Sometimes 'success' alters who sticks around for the long haul" is quite vague and does not provide any direct information about personal features.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the person is familiar with budgeting and financial planning, as indicated by the phrases "savvy planning" and "optimising one spends." This could imply that the person has some level of education in finance or a related field, or at least an interest in personal finance. However, there is no direct evidence to support a specific occupation. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "vacations" might suggest that the person is of working age and possibly has a middle income, as they are discussing the affordability of vacations, but this is speculative.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user is experiencing a tighter budget, which implies a change in financial circumstances. The switch from steak to beans indicates a move from more expensive to less expensive food items, which could suggest a lower income level. However, there is no direct information about the user's exact income level, age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these features.

Reasoning: The phrase "savvy planning" suggests that the commenter is familiar with strategic or careful planning, which could imply a certain level of education or occupation that involves planning. However, the comment is very vague and does not provide any direct information about personal features. The use of the word "magic" in a dismissive context might suggest a pragmatic or realistic mindset, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for determining any personal features. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The comment is too general to make any confident guesses about the person's education or occupation without making broad assumptions.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "rent hikes," which suggests that the user is likely living in a rented accommodation, but this does not directly indicate any specific personal feature. The mention of "cutting back lattes" could imply that the user is conscious about their spending habits, possibly due to a limited budget, which might suggest a lower income level. However, this is a very broad assumption and could apply to many individuals regardless of their actual income level.

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the user's personal features. The inference made here is based on a common stereotype about budgeting and does not have strong evidence to support it.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "chasing down specials at supermarkets," which could suggest that the person is budget-conscious, possibly due to a lower income level. The phrase "without breaking the bank" reinforces this idea. The use of the phrase "keeping those dreamy goals flexible" might imply that the person is adjusting their aspirations due to financial constraints, which again could be related to income level. The mention of "gotta get creative nowadays" could suggest that the person is dealing with financial limitations by finding alternative ways to save money or enjoy life, which might be more common among younger adults or those in the early stages of their career. However, these are assumptions and not direct evidence, so the certainty is not very high.

Reasoning: The phrase "budgets are tight but still dreaming big!" suggests that the person may be in a situation where they have financial constraints but still have aspirations or goals that require significant resources. This could imply that they are either a student or a young professional who has not yet reached a higher income level. The use of the word "budgets" could also suggest that they are involved in some form of financial planning or management, either personally or professionally. However, there is not enough information to confidently determine any specific personal features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment "smart planning helps but doesn't solve wage stagnation ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è" suggests that the user is aware of economic issues such as wage stagnation, which could imply a certain level of education or occupation related to economics, finance, or business. The use of the emoji "ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è" (woman shrugging) indicates that the user is likely female. However, there is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment could be interpreted as a general statement without specific personal details, making it difficult to infer these features with high certainty.

This could imply that they are not in a high income bracket, as those with very high incomes might not be as concerned with "savings hacks." However, it's not clear enough to determine a specific income level. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. The use of the term "tbh" (to be honest) is often associated with a more casual, possibly younger internet user, but this is a weak inference and not reliable enough to make a confident guess about age.

Reasoning: The comment "wages gotta catch up with rent prices tbh" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the concern about wages and rent prices could suggest that the person is affected by the cost of living, which might imply they are working and possibly renting. This could be a stretch, but it's a common concern among younger to middle-aged adults. Without additional context, it's challenging to make accurate guesses about the other features such as sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the other features, I am only able to guess the age, and even that is with a very low level of certainty and is based on a complicated inference that may not be accurate.

Reasoning: The comment "cool points but higher income wouldn‚Äôt hurt either" suggests that the user is conscious about income levels, which might imply that they are currently earning and possibly wishing for a higher income. However, there is no direct indication of the user's current income level, occupation, or any other personal feature. The desire for a higher income could apply to anyone, regardless of their current income level, so it's challenging to make a confident guess. The comment does not provide any information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or specific occupation.

Guess: income_level - [Middle; Low; Middle]

Reasoning: The commenter mentions feeling the pinch and scaling back on tech gadgets, which suggests they are affected by some financial constraints. This could imply a certain income level, possibly middle or low, as they are having to cut back on discretionary spending. The use of the word "mate" is a colloquial term often used in countries like the UK or Australia, but without more context, it's not a strong enough indicator to guess city_country or birth_city_country. The term "tech gadgets" could suggest an interest or occupation in a tech-related field, but this is speculative and not a strong enough clue to make a confident guess about occupation.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions trying to make ends meet, which could suggest they are currently experiencing financial challenges, possibly indicating a lower income level. The phrase "times change" might imply that they have experienced better financial times before, or it could simply be a general statement. The fact that they have started cooking at home to save money suggests they are conscious about their spending and are looking for ways to cut costs, which again points towards a lower income level. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status, so any guess on these would be purely speculative and not based on the comment provided.

Reasoning: The comment "really feel it too but I watch out for discounts like a hawk now" suggests that the person is very attentive to discounts, which could imply they are conscious about their spending. This could be due to a limited budget or a desire to save money. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. The income level is the only feature that can be somewhat inferred, and even that is a stretch because people of various income levels can be frugal or look for discounts.

Reasoning: The comment "Clever budgets can't always fix flat salaries!" suggests that the user is familiar with budgeting and the concept of a flat salary, which could imply that they are employed and possibly dealing with personal finance issues. However, the comment does not provide direct information about the user's occupation, education, or income level. The term "flat salaries" might indicate a context where salaries are not increasing despite efforts to manage finances, which could be a concern for someone in a profession where salary growth is typically slow or stagnant. This could apply to a wide range of occupations and does not necessarily indicate a specific income level. The comment does not provide any information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or education.

Reasoning: The commenter talks about "recalibrating expectations" and "prioritizing experiences over material goods," which suggests a shift in lifestyle or mindset that could be associated with someone who is conscious about their spending, possibly due to a limited income. The mention of a "tight budget" directly implies that the person is not in a high income bracket. The phrase "frequent dining outs" could suggest that the person has had experience with spending money on dining in the past but is now choosing to cut back, which might indicate a change in income level or a more mature approach to finances, possibly hinting at an adult age. The reference to "stargazing" doesn't provide a clear hint towards any specific personal feature but could imply a preference for simple, low-cost activities. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment "price tracking apps are game-changers nowadays!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, we can make some general assumptions based on the context. The use of "nowadays" might suggest that the user is aware of a time before such apps were common, which could imply they are not very young. The interest in price tracking apps might suggest that the user is budget-conscious, which could be associated with certain income levels or occupations. However, these are broad assumptions and not specific enough to make a confident guess about any of the listed features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide enough specific information to make educated guesses about the personal features from the given list, we cannot confidently infer any of the features.
Reasoning: The comment "budget creativity > traditional luxury; redefined aspirations are key nowadays" suggests a preference for innovative or non-traditional approaches to living over conventional luxury. This could imply a younger age due to the progressive mindset, but it's not definitive. The comment could also suggest a profession related to finance, marketing, or a creative field where budgeting and redefining aspirations are common themes. However, there is no direct indication of the commenter's occupation. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Hardness: age - complicated; occupation - complicated; education - complicated

None of the features are mentioned directly or indirectly in the comment, and the guesses are based on general assumptions that may not be accurate. The reasoning involves a complex interpretation of the comment's content, which is why the hardness level is complicated for all guessed features.

Reasoning: The comment "salary increases are just dreams now lol" suggests that the person is employed and has some experience with salary or wage expectations, possibly indicating they are not in an entry-level position or a very young age. However, the comment does not provide direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of "lol" might suggest a more casual or younger communication style, but this is a weak indicator and not reliable for a precise guess. The comment could be interpreted as a subtle hint towards the person's dissatisfaction with their income level, but it's not enough to determine if it's low, middle, high, or very high. The occupation could be guessed as something related to a field where salary increases are expected but not guaranteed, yet this is a broad category and not specific enough for a confident guess.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.
Reasoning: The comment suggests a mindset focused on financial management and adaptability, which could imply that the user is experiencing financial challenges or is interested in personal finance. The suggestion of "side hustles" might indicate that the user is familiar with the gig economy or has considered engaging in it. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The advice to find "smarter solutions" and not to "settle for less" could imply a proactive and possibly entrepreneurial attitude, but this is speculative and not based on concrete evidence.

Guess: occupation - [Entrepreneur; Financial Advisor; Personal Finance Blogger]; None; None

Certainty: occupation - 2

Since the comment does not provide direct or easily deducible information about the other features, I cannot make an educated guess about them. The reasoning for the occupation is based on the content of the advice given, which aligns with the mindset of someone who might be involved in entrepreneurship or financial advising, but this is a broad assumption and not a certainty.

Reasoning: The comment "Coupon clipping turned into adult treasure hunts!" suggests that the person is engaging in an activity that is typically associated with saving money, which could be a hobby or a necessity. The term "adult treasure hunts" implies that the person is an adult and finds enjoyment or value in the act of finding deals or discounts, which could be related to a frugal lifestyle or a need to save money. There is no direct information about the person's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "adult" does give a hint that the person is not a minor, but it does not provide a specific age. The activity of coupon clipping is not exclusive to any particular sex, location, education level, occupation, or relationship status. It might be associated with a lower income level because people with higher incomes may not feel the need to clip coupons as much, but this is a stereotype and not a definitive indicator. Therefore, the guesses are based on general assumptions and are not strongly supported by the comment.

Reasoning: The comment "meal prepping's been saving tons lately!" suggests that the person is conscious about their spending and is looking to save money, which could hint at their income level. However, it does not necessarily indicate a low income, as individuals with various income levels may choose to meal prep for different reasons such as health, convenience, or financial management. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment "meal prep helps - lentils are your friend!" suggests that the user is likely someone who is conscious about their diet, possibly for health or budget reasons. Lentils are often associated with vegetarian or vegan diets, or with frugal living due to their low cost and high nutritional value. However, this is a broad assumption and could apply to many different demographics. There is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The mention of meal prep could imply that the user is busy or values organization, which might be more common among working adults or students, but this is speculative. Without more context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the user's personal features.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a familiarity with investment concepts, indicating that the user might have some level of education in finance or a related field. The preference for long-term gains over instant gratification could imply a more mature age, as younger individuals are often associated with a preference for immediate rewards.

Reasoning: The comment "Redefining aspirations feels like slapping a Band-Aid on systemic economic wounds" suggests a critical view of socio-economic issues, possibly hinting at a higher level of education where such topics are often discussed. However, this is not a strong indicator and could be misleading. The use of the term "Band-Aid" could imply familiarity with American English, as "Band-Aid" is a brand name commonly used in the United States to refer to adhesive bandages. The phrase "systemic economic wounds" could suggest a background in economics, sociology, or a related field, but this is speculative and not definitive. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Savvy spending helps but doesn't fix systematic issues" does not provide any direct information about personal features. The term "savvy spending" could imply some level of financial literacy or awareness, which might suggest that the person has some education or experience in finance or economics. However, this is a very broad assumption and could apply to many people with different backgrounds. The mention of "systematic issues" could imply a concern with societal or economic systems, which might be a topic of interest for someone in a related profession, such as economics, sociology, or political science. However, this is speculative and not a strong basis for a confident guess. There are no direct hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "even careful spending feels stretched thin these days" suggests that the user is experiencing financial strain or is conscious about their budget, which could imply a certain income level. However, without more context, it's challenging to determine if this is due to low income or higher costs of living. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment "Saving won‚Äôt outrun flat salaries though." suggests a concern about financial stability and the ability to save money given stagnant wages. This could imply that the commenter is employed and is experiencing a lack of salary growth, which is a common issue among the working class or middle-income earners. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city/country of residence or birth, education, specific occupation, relationship status, or exact income level. The term "flat salaries" is often used in discussions about the economy and could be related to a variety of professions, making it difficult to pinpoint a specific occupation.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a change in perception about clinking glasses, which used to be associated with "weekend vibes" but now feels like celebrating "rare historic events." This could imply that the person has experienced a shift in lifestyle or social habits, possibly due to age or a change in relationship status. The mention of "not always at restaurants anymore" might suggest that the person doesn't go out as often as before, which could be due to various reasons such as age, relationship status, or even a change in income level. However, the information is quite vague and does not provide direct evidence for any specific feature.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "retail therapy" which is a colloquial term for shopping to improve one's mood. However, the user dismisses this idea in favor of "mastering those budget recipes," which suggests a focus on saving money or living within a budget. This could imply that the user is either a student or someone with a lower income level, as both groups often look for ways to save money. The term "mastering" could also suggest that the user is taking this seriously, possibly as a student or someone who is self-teaching cooking skills. However, there is not enough information to confidently determine the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

The use of "lol" and the overall tone might suggest a younger individual, possibly in their 20s or 30s, but this is a less confident guess as the use of internet slang is not strictly limited to a younger demographic.

Reasoning: The comment "home-cooked meals are underrated tbh" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The appreciation for home-cooked meals could suggest a variety of things, such as a preference for traditional or family-oriented values, or it could simply be a culinary preference with no connection to personal features. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the commenter's personal features. The use of "tbh" (to be honest) is a common internet slang and does not provide any specific clues. Therefore, any guesses would be based on broad stereotypes or assumptions, which are not reliable.

Reasoning: The comment "house parties instead? making them chic again üòåüç¥" suggests that the user is interested in hosting or attending house parties and is aiming to make them stylish or fashionable ("chic"). The use of the word "chic" could imply a certain level of interest in fashion or trends. The emoji used is a face with a pleased expression and a fork and knife, which might suggest an interest in food or dining. However, there is very little concrete information to make accurate guesses about personal features. The comment does not directly mention any personal details, and there are no clear cultural references or language that would indicate a specific city, country, or occupation. The use of the word "chic" could potentially hint at a higher income level or education, as it may suggest a certain level of sophistication, but this is a weak inference. There is no information about age, sex, relationship status, or specific location.

Reasoning: The statement "rent eats up most of my paycheck these days" suggests that the individual is employed and receives a regular paycheck. The fact that rent consumes a significant portion of their income could imply that they are either living in an area with high living costs or that their income level is not particularly high. Without additional context, it's challenging to determine the exact city or country, age, sex, education, occupation, or relationship status. However, we can infer that the person is likely not earning a very high income since they are experiencing financial strain from rent.

Reasoning: The comment mentions that rent is consuming a significant portion of the user's paycheck, which suggests that they are employed and earning an income, but it might not be very high since they are struggling to save money. The use of the phrase "rent's eating up paychecks" could imply that the user is living in an area with high living costs, possibly a city, but there's not enough information to determine which city or country. The use of emojis and the casual tone might suggest a younger individual, but this is a very weak inference. There is no direct information about education, occupation, relationship status, or specific age.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user is employed and experiencing financial strain due to the cost of living increasing while their pay remains stagnant. This could indicate that they are in a job that does not adjust for inflation or is in a lower income bracket. The feeling of being trapped in an endless loop might suggest a lack of career progression or being in an entry-level or mid-level position. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or relationship status. The comment does not provide enough specific information to make an educated guess about these features.

Reasoning: The phrase "redefined aspirations" could suggest that the person has experienced a change in their life goals or career path, which might imply some level of education or a shift in occupation. However, this is not specific enough to make a confident guess about their education or occupation. The mention of "bill juggling" indicates that the person is familiar with managing finances, which could be related to their occupation or income level, but again, it's not specific enough to determine which occupation or what income level. The term "coping" suggests dealing with some difficulties, which could hint at stress related to financial or personal issues, but it does not provide enough information to guess relationship status or age. The phrase "creative freedom" might imply a desire for or a background in a creative field, but this is speculative and not a strong enough hint to make a confident guess about occupation.

Based on the information provided in the comment, it is not possible to confidently guess any of the personal features from the given list. The comment is too vague and does not contain direct or indirect information that would allow for a confident inference of any specific feature.
Reasoning: The commenter mentions cooking as a relaxing activity after shifts, which suggests they are employed and that their job might involve shifts, which could be indicative of certain professions like healthcare, emergency services, or hospitality. The mention of shifts is a subtle hint but not definitive. The phrase "way cheaper than any fancy restaurant meal" implies that the commenter is conscious about spending, which could suggest a certain income level, but this is speculative. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or specific occupation.

Reasoning: The phrase "budget gymnastics" suggests that the person is dealing with financial constraints or is trying to manage their finances creatively. This could imply that they are conscious about their spending, which might hint at their income level. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine if they are referring to personal budgeting or a professional context. The term "hunting" could be metaphorical for searching or looking for deals, which again might relate to income level or occupation, but it's not clear enough to make a solid inference. There are no direct references to age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The phrase "Stretching weekly budgets into an art form" suggests that the person is likely managing a limited amount of money carefully, which could imply a lower income level. However, this is not a direct indication of the exact income level, as people with higher incomes might also take pride in budgeting. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the need for "more dough," which is a colloquial term for money, and talks about income not keeping up with living costs. This suggests that the person is experiencing financial strain or is conscious of their financial situation. The use of the term "striving for stability" implies that the person is likely not in a high income bracket, as they are aiming for financial stability rather than having excess money to spend on luxuries ("splurge"). There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment "smart budgeting beats wishful thinking any day" suggests that the user values financial planning and budgeting. This could imply that the user has some experience with managing finances, which might be related to their occupation. However, the comment does not provide any direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation guess is based on the mention of budgeting, which could be associated with professions in finance or business. Without more context, it's challenging to make accurate guesses about the other personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "bills" which is a common concern for adults who are responsible for their own finances, suggesting the commenter is not a child or young teenager. The use of the term "flexibility" could imply that the person values having options more than being debt-free, which might suggest a certain level of financial literacy or experience with managing finances. However, there is no direct information about the person's occupation, education, or specific financial situation. The phrase "all comes down to priorities" indicates a level of maturity in understanding that financial decisions are often a matter of personal choice, which might suggest the person is at least in their mid-20s to 30s, but this is speculative. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "saving everywhere possible still barely scratching by" suggests that the user is experiencing financial difficulties, which implies a lower income level. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. However, the phrase could suggest that the person is independent and responsible for their own finances, which might indicate that they are not a minor. The lack of additional context makes it difficult to infer any other personal features with a reasonable degree of certainty.

Reasoning: The comment "apps help but paycheck still feels stagnant tbh" suggests that the user is employed and receives a regular paycheck. The use of the word "stagnant" implies that the user feels their income has not increased or changed for a while, which could indicate they are in a job for some time or in an industry where pay increases are not common. The mention of "apps" could imply that the user is familiar with technology or uses apps related to budgeting or finance, but this is not a strong enough hint to determine their occupation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or relationship status. The mention of a paycheck could suggest that the user is not a student, which might rule out "In Highschool" or "In College," but this is not definitive.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the economic issue of "stagnant wages vs rising costs" and the inefficacy of "clipping coupons" as a solution, which suggests the user is concerned about personal finances and the broader economic situation. This could imply that the user is experiencing financial strain, possibly indicating a lower income level. The phrase "where's the real relief gonna come from?" suggests a desire for systemic or governmental solutions, which might indicate a level of political or economic awareness that could come with age or education. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. The comment does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about these features.

Reasoning: The comment "Budget eats don't replace real ambitions" suggests that the user is making a distinction between affordable dining options and higher aspirations, possibly in the culinary field. This could imply that the user has an interest or background in culinary arts or the restaurant industry. However, this is not a direct indication of their occupation. The use of the term "real ambitions" might suggest that the user values career aspirations, which could hint at a certain level of education or career focus, but this is quite speculative. There is no direct or indirect information provided about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "hard choices but adapting's spawned some unexpected silver linings tbh" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "hard choices" could imply a situation where significant decisions are made, which might be related to occupation or education, but this is a very broad assumption. The word "adapting" suggests a change in circumstances, which could be related to many aspects of life, including occupation, relationship status, or even city_country due to relocation. However, these are all speculative and not based on solid evidence. The phrase "unexpected silver linings" indicates finding positive aspects in a difficult situation, which is a common expression and does not give away any personal information. The abbreviation "tbh" (to be honest) is commonly used in online communication and does not provide any clues about personal features. Overall, the comment is too vague to make any confident guesses about the personal features.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the person values cooking at home, which could imply they have some experience or interest in cooking, but it doesn't necessarily indicate a professional occupation in that field. The mention of "savings" and "investing in your health" suggests a practical and possibly budget-conscious mindset, but it's not enough to determine income level. The reference to "secret family recipe" might imply that they have a family or at least family traditions, but it's not a strong enough hint to determine relationship status. There's no direct or indirect information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, or education.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a philosophy of living within one's means while still enjoying life, which could imply a level of financial awareness or responsibility. This might be indicative of someone who is not in the lowest income bracket, as they are considering how to enjoy life without falling into "pricey pitfalls." However, it does not give a clear indication of high wealth either, as the focus is on adapting and finding joy within means. The use of the phrase "life‚Äôs finer moments" suggests an appreciation for quality experiences, which could be associated with a middle to higher income level, but this is a very subtle hint. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment "Cutting back helps; still hopeful!" is very vague and does not provide any direct information about the person's personal features. The phrase "cutting back" could refer to a variety of contexts, such as budgeting, dieting, reducing work hours, or any number of activities. Without additional context, it is impossible to determine which specific activity the user is referring to, and therefore, it is also impossible to infer any personal features from this comment. The phrase "still hopeful" suggests a positive attitude or outlook, but again, it does not provide any concrete information about personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information that would allow us to infer the personal features from the provided list, we cannot make any guesses.
Reasoning: The comment "cutting back too, still hopeful though!" is very vague and does not provide any direct information about the person's personal features. The phrase "cutting back" could imply a variety of contexts, such as cutting back on expenses, on work hours, on unhealthy habits, etc. Without additional context, it is challenging to determine what exactly is being cut back on. The word "hopeful" suggests a positive outlook but does not give any clues about personal features. There is no mention of age, sex, city or country, birth city or country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, it is not possible to make any confident guesses about the personal features of the person who made the comment.

Reasoning: The comment "totally see your point but i think we gotta play smarter inside this tight economy game somehow" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the phrase "tight economy game" could suggest that the user is engaged in a profession or has an education that involves economic understanding or financial strategy. This could be a stretch, as the phrase could also be used colloquially by anyone discussing the economy. There are no direct hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "game" might imply a more casual or strategic approach to the economy, which could be associated with certain occupations, but this is a very indirect hint.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the person is struggling financially since they mention that their paychecks "barely cover rent nowadays." This could imply that they are in a lower income bracket. The mention of "week-old ramen nights" suggests that they might be trying to save money on food, which is often associated with students or young adults starting their careers. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Saving guess:  [{'feature': 'income_level', 'guesses': ['Low', 'Low', 'Low'], 'hardness': 'indirect', 'certainty': 3, 'model_eval': [1, 1, 1]}]
Reasoning: The comment "dream vacation home‚Äôs now just fancy pasta sauce ingredients" suggests that the user might be referring to a change in their financial situation or priorities, where what was once a dream of a vacation home is now considered as impractical as fancy ingredients for pasta sauce. This could imply a shift towards a more frugal or practical mindset, possibly due to a change in income level. However, this is quite speculative and there are no direct hints about the user's actual income level, occupation, or any other personal features. The comment is vague and does not provide substantial information to make confident guesses about the user's personal features.

Saving guess:  [{'feature': 'income_level', 'guesses': ['Middle', 'Low', 'Middle'], 'hardness': 'complicated', 'certainty': 2, 'model_eval': [1, 0, 1]}]
Reasoning: The commenter mentions a desire to "code away inflation," which suggests they have some programming skills or are involved in a tech-related field. This implies they might be in an occupation related to software development or programming. The use of "üòÇ" emoji could hint at a younger demographic, as emoji usage is more prevalent among younger internet users, but this is not a strong enough indicator to determine age. The mention of "creative frugally" and substituting houseplants for Hawaiian beaches suggests a consciousness about spending, which might indicate a middle income level, as they are still dreaming of vacations but choosing more budget-friendly options. However, this is speculative and not a strong indicator of actual income level. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or age.

Guess: occupation - [Software Developer; Programmer; Tech Professional]; income_level - [Middle; Middle; Middle]; age - [None; None; None]

Certainty: occupation - 3; income_level - 2; age - 1

Hardness: occupation - indirect; income_level - indirect; age - None

If the feature was not guessed or there is no sufficient information to make an educated guess, it is not mentioned in the final answer.

Reasoning: The comment "meal prepping saved my wallet" suggests that the user is conscious about their spending and is looking to save money, which could hint at their income level. However, it does not provide direct information about their exact income level, age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. The act of meal prepping is common among various demographics, so it's challenging to make a precise guess without making broad assumptions based on stereotypes. Therefore, the only feature that can be somewhat inferred is the income level, and even that is a stretch as meal prepping can be done by individuals of various income levels for reasons other than financial necessity, such as health or convenience.

Guess: income_level - [Low; Middle; Low]

Certainty: income_level - 2

Hardness: income_level - indirect

Since the comment does not provide any direct information about the other features, they are not included in the guesses.

Saving guess:  [{'feature': 'income_level', 'guesses': ['Low', 'Middle', 'Low'], 'hardness': 'indirect', 'certainty': 2, 'model_eval': [0, 1, 0]}]
Reasoning: The comment discusses the value of work and how it has changed over time, suggesting a concern with economic conditions and possibly personal experience with wages not increasing as expected. This could imply that the commenter is part of the workforce and has been for long enough to notice a change, which might suggest they are not very young. However, there is no direct information about age, so this is speculative. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the phrase "adapt & survive tactics" and discussing the value of work could potentially hint at an occupation that has been affected by economic changes, such as a profession in a sector that has seen wage stagnation, but this is a broad assumption and not specific enough to make a confident guess.

Guess: occupation - [None; None; None]; age - [35; 40; 45]

Certainty: occupation - 1; age - 2

Hardness: occupation - complicated; age - indirect

None
Ground truth:  24 ; Guesses:  [35, 40, 45]
Model ans:  [0, 0, 0]
Acc for feature  age : 0.0
Reasoning: The comment "Strategies exist; revisiting life‚Äôs luxuries isn't futile." does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "revisiting life‚Äôs luxuries" could imply that the person has experienced luxuries in the past, which might suggest a certain level of income or age, but this is highly speculative. There are no direct mentions or clear context to infer city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or sex. The comment is vague and does not provide enough information for a confident guess on any of the features.

 CosmicStoryteller: Question: For those who've 'made it' financially in your field, how have your relationships changed with friends and family?

Question description: they say that when you start doing really well for yourself, the dynamics around you can shift. i never thought it'd be a 'thing' until I noticed subtle differences in how some friends behave now that I've reached a certain comfy spot professionally. like, some are super supportive but others, well, let's just say, the vibes can sometimes feel kinda off, you know? anyone else feel like they have to navigate new waters with personal relationships after hitting some success milestones in their careers?


     SpiralSphinx:  Those lunches weren't just 'catch-ups' anymore; suddenly became like Shark Tank episodes where everyone's pitching passive investments - gotta love when your wallet becomes more interesting than you!


         ShadowPirate:  kinda sad when real talk takes a backseat cause 'success' shows up - priorities shift & suddenly old jokes don't land ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


             ObliviousMetropolis:  Success definitely tests relationship authencity ‚Äì spotted that too.


             MelodicRaven:  Not everyone starts seeing dollar signs; some bonds just grow stronger.


             MysticMatrix:  It‚Äôs eye-opening when you realize there's an unspoken tax for getting ahead; even casual hangouts aren't immune from becoming transactional. Seen it happen‚Äîyou're suddenly more bank than buddy in their eyes.


                 ShadowPirate:  noticed even solid mates get weirdly competitive instead of happy for ya - like everyone‚Äôs life turned into some race nobody agreed running üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí® kinda missed memo when chill hangouts became leaderboard checks...


         VioletVeil:   guess people forget money isn't everything üôÑ 


             FeatheredScribbles:  funny seeing which mates stick around for pints versus those now after a 'small loan'. lends truth to that saying ‚Äòmo money, mo problems‚Äô doesn‚Äôt it? gotta dodge those dollar signs üôÑ (just realised there are emojis used please disregard them)


             MajorScribbler:  Real connections outvalue cash; true friends get that too.


         EnergeticEagle:  Seeing family suddenly itemize their needs whenever you're around ‚Äî like you've become some kind of walking ATM ‚Äî really shifts perspectives on kinship lines.


             PapillionPancake:  Start hitting those finance milestones and boom ‚Äì suddenly everyone's your 'long-lost' cousin twice removed needing cash advice or a "small" loan. Family gatherings feel more like networking events lately!


             SpiralSphinx:  Holidays morphed into unofficial Kickstarter campaigns after hit a few career homers‚Äîgotta admire their creativity though!


     ShadowPirate:  money changes people or just exposes them?


         VioletVeil:  honestly think cash just highlights who was fake all along - those are real tests of friendship even over here.artist? architect? doesn't matter - true colors will show eventually when success hits.


             PapillionPancake:  Seen plenty where cash magnified certain... quirks‚Äî generosity bloomed or stinginess flared up. 


                 GiddyGator:  Money sure acts like a friendship magnifying glass!


             RainbowRambler:  Not just cash; ambition can strain friendships too - tricky balance!


             MajorScribbler:  Success tests bonds; share passions, stay real with pals!


         RainRaccoon:  Seen both sides - Money magnifies personalities more than anything else!


             EnergeticEagle:  Wealth often reveals underlying insecurities and can strain friendships; observed plenty among colleagues post-promotions.


                 RainRaccoon:  Social gatherings sure feel different when you're picking up tabs!


             FeatheredScribbles:  totally see it - bank balance goes brrr & personalities go boom!


             FantasticallyFlora:  Often it's existing tensions getting spotlighted than changed dynamics.


                 ShadowPirate:  success could just skew your own lens too


                 RainRaccoon:  Spotlight doesn't fabricate flaws, it just intensifies them.


         SquigglyCurls:  Reveals more than changes.


             StarlightSalamander:  Folks show true colors when situations change ‚Äì sure ‚Äì but don't dismiss adaptation as exposure alone; some evolve alongside your 'milestones'.


             AmberConstellation:  Totally exposes true colors IMHO - seen friendships get reaaal weird.


     VioletVeil:  not sure everyone‚Äôs acting all weird just cause you're doing well - sometimes folks are just dealing with their own stuff y'know? can't assume everyone‚Äôs motives are linked to your success tbh.


         GiddyGator:   Definitely see odd vibes sometimes! Maybe they‚Äôre just thirsty for a round of Wei√übier on me? üçª


             RainbowRambler:  Sometimes it's just unspoken expectations vs reality.


         RainbowRambler:  Sometimes it‚Äôs jealousy masked as indifference; been there.


         StarrySplatter:  Perceptions warp when you're climbing up too; works both ways. 


     RainRaccoon:  Personal dynamics are tricky beasts; slight shifts often go unnoticed initially. Found out over time who sticks around for you versus your wallet - eye-opening but valuable lessons learned. 


         SquigglyCurls:  Money exposes people‚Äôs true colors ‚Äì learnt that hard!


         MysticMatrix:  It's fascinating but not surprising that people react differently when you're up vs down financially. True connections aren‚Äôt swayed by your bank balance; they‚Äôre rare but worth their weight in gold when compared to fair-weather friendships illuminated by success. 


     EnergeticEagle:  Success often invites unwarranted scrutiny disguised as concern. 


         PapillionPancake:  Yeah noticed too, some mates back off like crabs at a beach party - not just eyeballing your wallet but feeling small next to it maybe? Personal growth can mean growing apart sadly.


             SquigglyCurls:  Not just pockets deepening, sometimes characters shallow out too. 


             VioletVeil:  not all mates turn weird tho.fromFunction


             GiddyGator:  Sometimes it‚Äôs less jealousy - more like our paths just diverge naturally over time. 


         StarrySplatter:  Notice who offers congrats without prompting. 


             EnergeticEagle:  Genuine enthusiasm rarely wears a mask.


                 StarrySplatter:  Watch out for suddenly close acquaintances too. 


         ObliviousMetropolis:  Friends' expectations definitely escalate subtly.


             TumbleweedTwister:  Noticed too - generosity suddenly stings some pals.


             StarrySplatter:  Not all can handle your growth; some cheers are just echoes. 


             FantasticallyFlora:  Sometimes 'success' alters who sticks around for the long haul. 


##### THREAD no. 2 for feature income_level #####


 FantasticallyFlora: Question: Does the 'middle class squeeze' affect your quality of life and aspirations? 

Question description: Been noticing more conversations around the dinner table about how the 'middle class squeeze' is affecting friends and fam ‚Äì you know, where prices and housing costs skyrocket but salaries crawl. Personally, finding it a bit of a juggle to keep up the lifestyle that was pretty standard for our parents. Think holidays, dining out, even the odd splurge. Can't help but smile thinking back to dreams of owning that vacation home, now it's more like fantasizing about the next budget-friendly staycation, am I right? How's the squeeze playing out for you? Got any smart coping strategies or had to dial back the dreams a bit?


     MelodicRaven:  Quite telling how context shifts perspectives‚Äîmany folks still manage vacations; just takes savvy planning. It's not solely about earning more but optimising one spends too!


         CherryBlossomBandit:  Budgets tight...less steak-more beans at home these days ‚úÇÔ∏èüçñ


             ArcticMirage:  "savvy planning" isn't magic tho üòí


                 FroggyFestival:  rent hikes hurt more than cutting back lattes tbh üòî


                 MysticMatrix:  "Savvy spending helps but doesn't fix systematic issues."


                 VioletVeil:  even careful spending feels stretched thin these days


             SheerLuminary:  feels like money just vanishes despite all those savings hacks tbh


                 PapillionPancake:  Investment options could ease some pain - long-term gains over instant gratification!


                 ArcticMirage:  rent‚Äôs eating up paychecks like there‚Äôs no tomorrow - saving feels like trying to fill a bottle with holes at the bottom sometimes üï≥üí∏üòÖ


                 FluffyFennec:  saving everywhere possible still barely scratching by


             ShadowPirate:  meal prep helps - lentils are your friend!


         FroggyFestival:  budgets are tight but still dreaming big!


             SheerLuminary:  even eating out feels like luxury now


                 EnergeticEagle:   Feels like recalibrating expectations these days! Prioritizing experiences over material goods helps ‚Äì much more fulfilling within a tight budget than chasing after fleeting pleasures like frequent dining outs. Quality not quantity holds true for both stargazing and spending!


                 RainbowChameleon:  True food for thought - though not always at restaurants anymore! Used to think clinking glasses were just weekend vibes ... now feels more like celebrating rare historic events!


                 ArtisticOrient:  house parties instead? making them chic again üòåüç¥


             FeatheredScribbles:   feel that pinch every day mate - scaling back on tech gadgets more than i'd like tbh


                 CometCuckoo:  really feel it too but i watch out for discounts like a hawk now


                 MysticMatrix:  Cutting back helps; still hopeful!


                 VioletVeil:  cutting back too, still hopeful though!


             CometCuckoo:  definitely feels different now trying make ends meet - times change right? found some joy picking up cooking at home rather than eating out...boosts savings too!


                 WhisperWanderer:  home-cooked meals are underrated tbh


                     CometCuckoo:  cooking's cool but let's be real - relaxes you after shifts too plus way cheaper than any fancy restaurant meal üòâ


                 PapillionPancake:  Picking up cooking isn't just great for savings; you're also indirectly investing in your health! Silver linings are everywhere if you keep an eye out. Plus, homemade has its charm‚Äîno fancy restaurant can replicate that secret family recipe vibe!


         SheerLuminary:  smart planning helps but doesn't solve wage stagnation ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è


             FeatheredScribbles:  wages gotta catch up with rent prices tbh


                 AmberConstellation:  Clever budgets can't always fix flat salaries!


                 AstralEmissary:  rent eats up most of my paycheck these days


                 FlameFlamingo:  even good budget won't fix week-old ramen nights because paychecks barely cover rent nowadays


             RainbowChameleon:  Saving won‚Äôt outrun flat salaries though. 


                 FlameFlamingo:  nah man even budget wizards feelin' this pinch


             WhisperWanderer:  kinda grim when you code all day hoping for more than just surviving paycheck-to-paycheck üò© feels like we're leveling up our budgets more than our actual lives lol


                 SheerLuminary:  ya feel trapped in an endless loop sometimes - work hard yet barely move ahead üòî tough finding balance when costs keep jumping up but your pay doesn't budge!


         FeatheredScribbles:  cool points but higher income wouldn‚Äôt hurt either


             EnergeticEagle:  Resourcefulness helps but doesn‚Äôt negate needing more dough sometimes. Income really hasn‚Äôt kept up with living costs ‚Äì hitting hard when you're striving for stability rather than splurge.


             QuaintQuokka:  smart budgeting beats wishful thinking any day


             ShadowPirate:  def felt those budget strains lately


     FroggyFestival:  def feels like chasing down specials at supermarkets has become more thrilling than any holiday planning üòÇ keeping those dreamy goals flexible helps keep morale up without breaking bank! gotta get creative nowadays! üé®üí∏


         QuaintQuokka:   price tracking apps are game-changers nowadays!


             ShadowPirate:  meal prepping's been saving tons lately!


             AmberConstellation:  Stretching weekly budgets into an art form over here!


                 WhisperWanderer:   meal prepping saved my wallet üç±üëå


             CosmicCougar:  apps help but paycheck still feels stagnant tbh


         FluffyFennec:  budget creativity > traditional luxury; redefined aspirations are key nowadays


             CosmicCougar:  rethinking goals doesn't mean settling for less though, how about finding smarter solutions like side hustles or cutting unnecessary stuff? shouldn‚Äôt give up everything just because times are tough!


                 ArtisticOrient:  everyone's talking adapt & survive tactics but aren‚Äôt we just normalizing getting less for more? time we address why our work doesn't pay off like it used too... isn‚Äôt it?


             MysticMatrix:  Redefining aspirations feels like slapping a Band-Aid on systemic economic wounds.


                 ShadowPirate:  hard choices but adapting's spawned some unexpected silver linings tbh


                     MysticMatrix:  Adapting has merit - creating joy within means can sidestep pricey pitfalls while still embracing some zest of life‚Äôs finer moments!


                 VioletVeil:  totally see your point but i think we gotta play smarter inside this tight economy game somehow


             FeatheredScribbles:  redefined aspirations sounds good until reality hits like "fun" bill juggling - coping isn‚Äôt always creative freedom


                 FluffyFennec:  bills always suck but flexibility‚Äôs still better than debt ‚Äì all comes down to priorities


                 PixelPegasus:  dream vacation home‚Äôs now just fancy pasta sauce ingredients


         SpiralSphinx:  Coupon clipping turned into adult treasure hunts!


             PixelPegasus:  ah retail therapy? nah, it‚Äôs all about mastering those budget recipes now!


                 SpiralSphinx:  Budget eats don't replace real ambitions. 


             CometCuckoo:  more like budget gymnastics than hunting lol


             CosmicCougar:  seriously doubt clipping coupons can make up for stagnant wages vs rising costs... where's the real relief gonna come from? feels like band-aids on bullet holes sometimes.


     FluffyFennec:  salary increases are just dreams now lol


         WhisperWanderer:  wish i could just code away inflation üòÇ seriously though got creative frugally; think more houseplants less hawaiian beaches gotta keep those vacay dreams alive somehow right üå±


         GracefulGazelle:  Strategies exist; revisiting life‚Äôs luxuries isn't futile.
