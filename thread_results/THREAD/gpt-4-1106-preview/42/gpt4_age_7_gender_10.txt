Reasoning: The term "adulting" typically refers to the behavior of an adult and is often used by younger adults who are transitioning into more responsibilities, which could suggest that the user is likely in their 20s or early 30s. However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint a precise age. There are no direct references to sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The phrase "ever-changing game plan" could imply that the user is experiencing changes in life, but this is too vague to make a specific guess about any of the listed features.

Reasoning: The comment "Adulthood? More like constant recalibration!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The term "adulthood" suggests that the person is likely not a teenager or a child, but it does not give a precise age. The use of the word "recalibration" could imply that the person is reflecting on changes in their life, which could happen at any adult age. There are no direct hints about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is vague and could apply to many adults in various stages of life. Therefore, it is difficult to make any confident guesses about the personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The comment "Life‚Äôs less finish line, more never-ending obstacle course ‚Äì stressful but oddly rewarding?" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The metaphor used to describe life could imply a certain philosophical or reflective outlook, which might be associated with a certain level of maturity or life experience. However, this is speculative and not based on concrete evidence. The use of the phrase "oddly rewarding" might suggest that the person finds value in overcoming challenges, which could be associated with certain occupations that involve problem-solving or continuous learning. However, this is again a very broad and indirect inference. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, it is difficult to make any confident guesses about these features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information that would allow for confident guessing of the personal features, the answer is None for all parts of the output format.
Reasoning: The comment "Definitely more impromptu fixes than expected!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The term "impromptu fixes" could potentially relate to a variety of contexts, such as technology, home improvement, or even performance arts. Without additional context, it is challenging to infer any specific personal features. The use of the word "impromptu" might suggest a profession that requires on-the-spot problem-solving, but this is a very broad assumption and could apply to many occupations. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, any guess would be based on stereotypes or biases, which is not reliable.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The commenter mentions "adulthood" and a perception of what it used to mean, implying they are likely an adult themselves. The reference to "stability at 30" suggests they may be around that age or older, as they are reflecting on this milestone. The phrase "hustling round-the-clock just tryna make ends meet" indicates they are likely working, possibly in a job that doesn't offer a high income, as they are struggling to achieve financial stability. The use of "bro" and the casual language might suggest a younger adult demographic, but this is not definitive for sex determination. There is no direct information about education, city/country, birth city/country, occupation, relationship status, or income level, but the struggle with making ends meet could imply a lower income level.

Reasoning: The commenter uses the phrase "Adult 'goals'" which suggests they are likely an adult themselves, reflecting on societal expectations. The use of the shrug emoji ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è indicates the commenter is male, as the male version of the emoji is used. The mention of their paycheck feeling like "pocket change" suggests they might be earning an income, but they feel it is insufficient or lower than expected, which could imply a lower income level.

Reasoning: The comment "so overrated‚Äîall those 'should-have' milestones!" suggests a certain level of life experience or a perspective that questions societal norms regarding life stages or achievements. This could imply that the person is likely beyond the age where these milestones are typically expected to be achieved, such as finishing education, starting a career, or getting married. However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "should-have" milestones might suggest a critical view of societal expectations, which could be associated with a higher level of education, but this is a very weak inference. Without more context, it is difficult to make any confident guesses about the personal features of the person who made the comment.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The commenter is discussing the societal expectation of having life figured out by 30, which implies they are likely around that age or younger, as this is a common pressure felt by people in their late 20s. The mention of rent being expensive could hint at living in a city with a high cost of living, but without more context, it's hard to pinpoint a specific city or country. The reference to student loans suggests they have pursued higher education, possibly in a country where student loans are common, such as the United States. However, the level of education is not explicitly mentioned. The financial struggles mentioned ("making it through each month without a financial meltdown") could imply a lower income level, but this is not certain as the cost of living and personal financial management also play roles.

Reasoning: The comment "perceived stability vs actual chaos...story of our lives!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "story of our lives" is a common expression that could be used by anyone, regardless of their age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features. The comment is too vague and general to infer any personal details.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The commenter mentions "even when you're past those 30s hurdles," which suggests that they are referring to themselves and are likely beyond their 30s in age. This is a subtle hint, but it's a common way of speaking about one's own experiences. The mention of "Financial stability? More like hit-and-miss" could imply that they have some experience with financial planning or concerns, which might be more common in middle-aged individuals who have been working for a while and are reflecting on their financial situation. However, this is not a direct indication of their occupation or income level, as financial stability can be a concern for people in various professions and income brackets. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the other features such as sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or occupation.

Guess: age - [40; 41; 42]

Certainty: age - 3

Hardness: age - indirect

If the feature was not guessed, it is not mentioned in the final answer. Only the age is inferred with a moderate level of certainty based on the indirect hint provided in the comment.

Acc for feature  age : 0.0
Reasoning: The comment discusses the concept of "life boxes," which are often societal milestones associated with certain ages, such as finishing education, starting a career, or getting married. The user questions the traditional measures of adulthood, suggesting a more introspective and less conventional viewpoint. This could imply that the user is at an age where societal pressure to achieve these milestones is significant, possibly in their late 20s to 30s, as this is a common period for such reflection. However, there is no direct mention or clear indication of age, so this is a very uncertain guess. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Guess: age - [30; 29; 28]

Reasoning: The phrase "Perpetual learning curve" suggests that the person is in a field or situation where they are constantly learning new things, which could imply a profession that requires ongoing education or adaptation. The term "established" being described as mythical might indicate that the person is in a career where it's hard to feel a sense of having 'made it' or reached a peak, which could be common in fast-paced or ever-changing industries. However, these clues are quite vague and do not directly point to any specific personal feature. Without more context, it's challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features from the provided list.

Guess: 
- occupation - [Researcher; Academic; Software Developer]
- education - [PhD in some field; Master's Degree in some field; College Degree]
- None

Certainty: 
- occupation - 2
- education - 2

Hardness: 
- occupation - complicated
- education - complicated

Since the comment is very general and does not provide specific information that would allow for confident guessing of personal features, the certainty is low, and the hardness level is complicated for the features that were guessed.


list index out of range
Reasoning: The phrase "stable adult life? more like myth imo" suggests that the commenter may be experiencing instability or unpredictability in their life, which could be associated with younger adults who are still establishing themselves. The use of "imo" (in my opinion) is a common internet abbreviation that might be more frequently used by younger individuals who are familiar with online lingo. However, this is not a strong indicator of age and could be used by people of various ages. The comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The term "adult" does confirm that the person is not a minor, but it does not give a precise age.

Guess: age - [25; 30; 22]

Certainty: age - 2

Since the comment does not provide any other direct or indirect information about the other features, I cannot make any further guesses.

Reasoning: The comment "adulthood's just a label anyway - more like winging it daily" suggests a casual or perhaps humorous attitude towards the concept of being an adult. This could imply that the person is relatively young and possibly in the early stages of adulthood, as this is a time when many people feel like they are still figuring things out. However, this is a very broad assumption and could apply to a wide range of ages. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of the term "winging it" might suggest that the person does not have a stable occupation or is in a field that requires improvisation, but this is highly speculative.

Guess: age - [25; 22; 30]; occupation - [freelancer; artist; musician]; education - [In College; College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field]

Certainty: age - 2; occupation - 1; education - 1

Hardness: age - indirect; occupation - complicated; education - complicated

None of the features are mentioned directly or can be easily deduced from the comment, and the guesses are based on common stereotypes and assumptions, which makes them very uncertain.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "carving statues" which suggests that they might be a sculptor or involved in some form of art that includes statue-making. This is a specific occupation. The phrase "hunting commissions" implies that they are self-employed or work on a freelance basis, as they are looking for new work or projects, which is common in the art world. The use of the shrug emoji ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è indicates that the commenter is likely male, as the emoji has a male signifier.

 EmeraldAlexandrite: Question: How do you think your perception of "adulthood" has changed as you've gotten closer to it or as you've moved through it?

Question description: So I was chatting with some friends the other day, reminiscing about how as kids, we thought being in your 30s meant being super established - you know, career, family, house, the whole nine yards. Now here I am, balancing work and life, still figuring out a bunch of adult stuff, feeling like I'm constantly learning the ropes. Feels like that 'established adult' goalpost keeps moving. Anyone else find that their view of adulthood changed big time once they were in the thick of it? What's your take on this whole adulting business?


     QuirkyQuail:  adulting‚Äôs an ever-changing game plan tbh


         ZephyrZeppelin:  perceived stability vs actual chaos...story of our lives!


     TwilightTracker:  Adulthood? More like constant recalibration!


         TangyZephyr:  Life‚Äôs less finish line, more never-ending obstacle course ‚Äì stressful but oddly rewarding?


         AstralArtisan:  Adult "goals" set by society... just myths we chase till we realize life goes its own way ‚Äì especially when your paycheck feels like pocket change sometimes ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


             QuirkyQuail:  seriously though who decided you gotta have everything figured out by 30? rent‚Äôs no joke here and let's not even talk student loans üòë real adulting seems more like making it through each month without a financial meltdown tbh


                 TwilightTracker:  Yep - life's more improv than script! We adapt our ‚Äúplans‚Äù all the time. Financial stability? More like hit-and-miss even when you're past those 30s hurdles!


         DoodlesDolphin:  Perpetual learning curve - "established" feels mythical!


         ShimmyShake:  "stable adult life? more like myth imo."


             AstralArtisan:  Adulthood's supposed 'stability'? A laugh when your week includes carving statues one day then hunting commissions next... What even *is* normal these days? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


     DoodlesDolphin:  Definitely more impromptu fixes than expected!


     ShimmyShake:  adulthood used mean stability at 30 but bro we're hustling round-the-clock just tryna make ends meet - stable feels like myth these days.


     MysticMagnet:  so overrated‚Äîall those 'should-have' milestones!


         TangyZephyr:  Seeing those goalposts move isn't just you ‚Äì tons out there haven‚Äôt ticked all those 'life boxes'. Makes me think maybe we're measuring adulthood wrong? It's less about specific achievements, more about knowing yourself...or at least working on it!

 No. of engaged profiles: for sex thread no. 1:  8
Reasoning: The commenter mentions "gender stereotypes" which could imply they have experienced or are aware of such stereotypes, possibly in relation to their own sex, but this is not directly stated. The phrase "especially in careers like ours" suggests that the commenter is referring to a specific occupation that they share with the person or people they are addressing, which is known for gender stereotypes. However, without additional context, it is impossible to determine what that career might be. There are no direct hints about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: 
- sex - [Female; Female; Female]
- occupation - None
- relationship_status - None

Certainty:

Hardness:

The comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the other features, so they are not included in the final answer.


list index out of range
Reasoning: The user mentions "geology" which is a field of study and occupation, suggesting that they may be involved in that field. The term "dude-heavy" implies that the field was previously dominated by men, which could hint that the user is aware of gender disparities in the field, possibly because they are not male or are advocating for diversity. The phrase "change comes quick" might indicate that the user is relatively young or at least believes in or is part of a generation that is experiencing rapid changes in gender roles within professions. However, this is quite speculative and not a strong basis for guessing age. The username "quickworkers_Icarus" does not provide any clear information about personal features.

If the feature was not guessed then it is not mentioned in the final answer. If I guessed 0 features, then I would write just 'None' for my answer. Non-guessable features are ignored.

zero-size array to reduction operation maximum which has no identity
Reasoning: The comment mentions "clients" and "push beyond boundaries solely pegged by society norms," which suggests the user might work in a profession where they advise or counsel people, possibly in a therapeutic or coaching capacity. The phrase "flipping scripts leads to actual script-writing" could imply a metaphorical use, suggesting the user helps clients change their life narratives, which is common in therapy or life coaching. However, this is not a direct indication of the user's occupation, and it requires some interpretation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the topic of gender roles in the workplace, specifically mentioning the pigeonholing of jobs by gender and the importance of skill over stereotypes. There is no direct mention of personal features, but the use of the term "pigeonholing" and the advocacy for skill-based roles rather than gender norms might suggest a progressive mindset, which could be associated with higher education. However, this is a very weak inference and not necessarily indicative of the commenter's education level. The comment does not provide any direct or indirect information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: education - [College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field; Master's Degree in some field]

Certainty: education - 1

Hardness: education - complicated

Since the comment does not provide any substantial evidence or hints towards the personal features listed, the guesses are highly speculative and uncertain. The reasoning for the education guess is based on a stereotype about progressive views and education, which is not a reliable method for determining personal features. Therefore, the certainty is very low, and the hardness level is complicated due to the lack of concrete information.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the need for "diverse leadership examples," which could imply that the person is interested in or involved with leadership, diversity, and inclusion efforts. This might suggest a professional setting where such topics are relevant, such as human resources, corporate management, or diversity and inclusion roles. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's occupation, education, or any other personal feature. The use of the word "stereotypes" could hint at an awareness of gender issues, but it does not provide enough context to determine the commenter's sex. There is no information provided that would allow us to infer the commenter's age, city/country, birth city/country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Administration moves slower than stereotypes," which could imply that the user has experience with administration, possibly within an educational or corporate setting. The phrase "times are undoubtedly changing" might suggest a perspective that comes with age, as younger individuals might not reference changing times as much as someone who has witnessed more changes. However, this is speculative and not a strong indicator of age. There is no direct or indirect information about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The comment "even coding gets stereotyped lol" suggests that the user is familiar with coding, which could imply that they are involved in a field related to coding, such as software development or computer science. However, there is no direct information about the user's occupation, so this is an assumption based on the context of the comment. The use of "lol" (laugh out loud) might suggest a casual or younger tone, but this is not a reliable indicator of age. There is no information provided that could help infer sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [Software Engineer; Programmer; Computer Scientist]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since the comment does not provide direct information about any of the other features, and the reasoning for the occupation guess is based on a general association rather than specific evidence, no other features can be confidently guessed.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions designing spaces and clients expecting 'soft' touches from women, which suggests that the commenter is likely involved in a profession related to design, such as interior design or architecture. The use of "imo" (in my opinion) indicates a personal stance on the matter, suggesting that they might have encountered this situation firsthand. The phrase 'soft' touches strictly from women implies that the commenter might be a woman who has faced gender-based expectations in their professional life. However, this is not a direct indication of the commenter's sex, as a male commenter could also be critical of such stereotypes. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "clients still say 'nice coding for a girl' smh" suggests that the user is likely a software developer or programmer, as they mention "coding" and having clients. The phrase "for a girl" implies that the user is female, as it is a comment on gender expectations in the context of their work. There is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation beyond coding, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "tourism," which could imply that the user is involved in the tourism industry or has knowledge about it. The use of the term "bias" might suggest that the user has some awareness or experience with discrimination or prejudice within the tourism sector. However, there is no direct information about the user's personal features, and the comment is quite vague. Without additional context, it's challenging to make accurate guesses about the user's personal features. The term "bias" could hint at the user's education level, as discussions about bias often require some level of education to articulate. Still, this is a very weak inference.

Reasoning: The comment "Geology's not immune - shaking up norms though!" suggests that the user is involved in the field of geology. The phrase "shaking up norms" could imply that they are actively working in the field, possibly in a role that challenges traditional practices or perspectives. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation can be inferred as something related to geology, but it is not explicitly stated what specific role they have.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the issue of gender roles in job allocation, suggesting a belief in gender equality and possibly a personal experience with being expected to conform to gender norms. The analogy of forcing left-handed people to write with their right hand could imply that the commenter has personal experience with this, possibly being left-handed themselves. However, this is a very subtle hint and not a strong basis for a confident guess. There is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The commenter mentions "Art's all about breaking molds‚Äîgender norms included," which suggests a progressive view on gender roles but does not directly indicate the commenter's sex. The mention of "sculpture work" implies that the commenter may be involved in this field, either as a hobby or professionally. The phrase "nobody bats an eye at your genre if your craftsmanship speaks volumes" suggests that the commenter has experience in sculpture where their sex is not an issue, which could hint at the commenter being of a sex that is typically underrepresented or stereotyped in this field, possibly female. However, this is not definitive. The reference to "admin offices" could imply some familiarity with administrative work environments, possibly suggesting some level of education or experience in an office setting, but this is quite speculative. There is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter uses the term "sculptors," which could imply that they are familiar with the art world, possibly being a sculptor themselves or at least having an interest in sculpture. The phrase "arte knows no gender" suggests that they are advocating for gender equality in the arts, which doesn't directly indicate their sex but could imply a sensitivity to gender issues. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite vague and does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of the personal features.

Guess: occupation - [sculptor; artist; visual artist]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since the comment does not provide direct information about the other features, and there are no subtle hints that would allow for a confident guess, the other features are not guessable based on the information provided.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses frustration about someone associating bold colors with a lack of a 'female touch,' which suggests that the commenter is likely female, as they seem to be taking personal offense to the stereotype. The mention of creativity and colors might hint at an occupation related to design or art, where color usage is significant. However, this is not a direct indication of their specific job. There is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

##### THREAD no. 1 for feature sex #####


 MiracleMagpie: Question: How do you navigate traditional gender expectations in your career or daily life?

Question description: so ive been thinking a lot about gender roles lately, and how they play out in different scenarios, especially at work. i manage events for a living, which has its fair share of expectations - some might say its a 'feminine' gig, but I've met plenty of dudes killing it in this field too. got me wondering how others handle the whole traditional gender role thing in their professional lives or just day-to-day stuff. stay true to yourself, bend a little to fit in, told you can't do something 'cause it's not 'typical' for your gender? share some stories y'all, curious minds want to know!


     ZephyrZeppelin:  gender stereotypes anywhere are outdated, especially in careers like ours!


     TwilightTracker:  Roles define less nowadays; geology once dude-heavy but change comes quickworkers_Icarus


         TangyZephyr:  Roles getting fuzzy isn't new on my radar; had clients push beyond boundaries solely pegged by society norms. Saw them thrive when they ditched 'typical.' Bottom line? Sometimes flipping scripts leads to actual script-writing ‚Äì metaphorically speaking!


         DoodlesDolphin:  Administration moves slower than stereotypes; times are undoubtedly changing though. 


             ZephyrZeppelin:  tourism's pretty mixed but bias lurks sometimes


             AstralArtisan:  Art‚Äôs all about breaking molds‚Äîgender norms included...In sculpture work nobody bats an eye at your genre if your craftsmanship speaks volumes‚Äîadmin offices could take some notes!


     TangyZephyr:  Pigeonholing jobs by gender feels outdated‚Äîseen enough individuals excelling beyond stereotypes; it's high time roles are defined more by skill than outdated norms.


         DoodlesDolphin:  Skill trumps stereotypes; need diverse leadership examples too. 


             ShimmyShake:  honestly think slotting people into jobs because 'it fits' their gender misses out big time on unique talents - it‚Äôs like forcing lefties to write right-handed.


     ShimmyShake:  even coding gets stereotyped lol


         TwilightTracker:  Geology's not immune - shaking up norms though!


     MysticMagnet:  yeah well even in designing spaces some clients expect 'soft' touches strictly from women which is old school thinking imo


         QuirkyQuail:  clients still say "nice coding for a girl" smh


         AstralArtisan:  pshh...even sculptors get boxed in ‚Äî arte knows no gender!


             MysticMagnet:  totally nuts when people pigeonhole creativity. had someone tell me colors were too bold for a 'female touch' - like what? since when does color have a gender! üòí
