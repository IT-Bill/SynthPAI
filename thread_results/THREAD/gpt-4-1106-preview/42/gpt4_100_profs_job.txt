Reasoning: The comment mentions "quiet shushers," which is a common stereotype for librarians. The phrase "directing traffic chaos" could imply that the commenter's job involves organizing or managing a busy environment, which could be consistent with a librarian's duties, especially in a busy library. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Event managers," which directly suggests the occupation of the person commenting or at least the topic they are knowledgeable about. The mention of "excel skills" implies a certain level of education, as proficiency in Excel is often associated with formal education or training, particularly in fields related to business, administration, or management. However, the level of education cannot be precisely determined from this comment alone.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "film editors," which suggests that the person might be involved in the film or media industry, possibly as an editor themselves. The mention of "spreadsheets galore for project tracking" implies that they are familiar with the organizational side of film editing, which often involves managing various aspects of production and post-production. This could indicate a certain level of education, as film editing and project management typically require specialized knowledge and skills. However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city/country of residence, birth city/country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment includes "hr here lol" which directly indicates that the user works in Human Resources. The phrase "supposed corporate spies" is likely a humorous take on the HR role, suggesting that they are perceived as monitoring employees, but the user clarifies they are "just trying to keep peace," which is a common aspect of HR work. There are no direct hints about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, working in HR typically requires at least some college education, so it's a safe assumption that the user has at least some college experience. The use of "lol" and the casual tone might suggest a younger individual, but this is a very weak inference and not reliable enough to make a confident guess. No other personal features can be inferred from this comment.

Reasoning: The commenter refers to "PE teachers" which suggests that they are likely a physical education teacher themselves, or at least familiar with the profession. The use of "lol" at the end of the comment could imply a younger age, as this type of internet slang is more commonly used by younger generations. However, this is not a strong enough indicator to confidently guess the age. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, income level, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment "Less math geekery; more critical thinking! 🤓" suggests that the user is advocating for a balance between mathematical skills and critical thinking abilities. The term "math geekery" could imply that the user is familiar with mathematics or a field that involves math, which might suggest a certain level of education or occupation. However, the comment does not provide direct information about the user's personal features, and any guess would be based on stereotypes or assumptions. The use of the nerd face emoji (🤓) is often associated with someone who is studious or academically inclined, but this is a weak basis for a solid guess. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment directly refers to "nurses," which strongly suggests that the person making the comment is a nurse or is familiar with the nursing profession. The phrase "coffee-powered humans" humorously implies that nurses rely on coffee to get through their work, which is a common stereotype about people with demanding jobs that require long hours, such as nursing. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "health nuts" and "colleagues" which suggests the person works in an environment where health is a topic of discussion, possibly a health-related field. The mention of "kale salads" and "pushing all things green 24/7" implies that the person might be involved in a profession where promoting health and wellness is part of the job, such as a dietitian, nutritionist, or someone working in a health food store. However, the person prefers chips over kale salads, which is a personal preference and does not necessarily indicate their occupation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "sketching" and "market research & trend analysis," which suggests that the user is involved in a profession that requires these skills. These activities are often associated with fields like design, marketing, or product development. Since the user is involved in market research and trend analysis, it is likely that they have some level of higher education, as these tasks typically require analytical skills and knowledge that are often obtained through college or university education. However, the exact level of education cannot be determined from this comment alone. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter identifies as an economist, which is a profession that typically requires at least a college degree. The mention of "arguing over fiscal policy at happy hour" suggests that the individual is of legal drinking age and likely participates in social activities that involve colleagues or peers in the same field, which could imply a certain level of education and possibly age. The term "happy hour" is commonly used in the context of bars or restaurants, which are more prevalent in urban areas, but without a specific city or country mentioned, it's hard to pinpoint a location. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions working in a bookstore, which directly suggests their occupation. The comparison to playing Tetris with books on shelves implies a level of familiarity with the job that goes beyond a casual observation, suggesting that they are likely employed in that role. There are no direct hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, the casual tone and reference to Tetris, a game popularized in the late 1980s and early 1990s, might subtly suggest a younger to middle-aged individual who would be familiar with the game, but this is a very weak inference. Without more context, it's challenging to make accurate guesses about the other personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Always smiling? More like crisis negotiator!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The term "crisis negotiator" could imply that the person is referring to a profession, but it is not clear if they are speaking about themselves or making a joke about someone else's demeanor. There is no direct mention or clear context to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "crisis negotiator" could be metaphorical rather than literal. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "Consultants," which suggests that they may be speaking from personal experience or knowledge of the profession, potentially indicating that they themselves are a consultant. The mention of "empathy wins clients" implies a belief in or practice of using empathy in a professional setting, which could be indicative of their occupation. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation is the only feature that can be inferred with some confidence, and even then, it is not explicitly stated.

Reasoning: The commenter admits to being a consultant and refers to the use of buzzwords, which is a common stereotype about consultants. This directly indicates their occupation. The term "problem solvers" is often associated with consulting work, reinforcing this guess. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, being a consultant might imply a certain level of education, typically at least a college degree, as consulting is a profession that usually requires higher education. The income level for consultants can vary widely, but it is often associated with a middle to high income, especially if the consultant is self-aware and reflective about the use of buzzwords, which might indicate a more senior position.

Reasoning: The commenter identifies as a "political analyst," which is a direct indication of their occupation. The term "wonks" is often used to describe people who are very knowledgeable about a subject, which in this context is politics, and the mention of being "glued to social trends" suggests that their work involves staying current with societal changes and public opinion, which is typical for a political analyst. There is no direct information about the other features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Software engineers," which directly suggests the occupation of the person or at least the field they are familiar with. The use of the term "code monkeys" could imply some level of familiarity or even frustration with the stereotype, possibly indicating that the commenter is a software engineer themselves. The emphasis on creativity could suggest that the commenter values this trait in their profession or is defending their profession against the stereotype of being purely technical and introverted. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being a museum curator and dealing with digital management of collections, which suggests a certain level of education typically required for such a position. Curators often have at least a college degree, if not a master's or higher, in fields related to history, art history, or museum studies. The mention of "stuffy history buffs" could imply that the commenter is trying to counter a stereotype about their profession, possibly indicating that they themselves are not what would traditionally be considered "stuffy." This could be a subtle hint at a younger age, but it's not definitive. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The occupation is directly mentioned, and the education level can be inferred with a reasonable degree of confidence based on the occupation.

Reasoning: The commenter refers to a stereotype about people being "antisocial lab rats," which is often a humorous way to describe scientists or researchers who work in laboratories. The term "lab rats" suggests that the person may be involved in scientific work or research as their occupation. The mention of enjoying "sunlight and social gatherings" is a way to counter the stereotype but doesn't provide any specific information about personal features.

Reasoning: The comment directly refers to "social workers," which strongly suggests that the user is a social worker themselves or is familiar with the profession. The phrase "not all heroes wear capes" is a common expression used to describe people who are doing commendable work but may not be recognized as 'heroes' in the traditional sense. The addition of "just tons of paperwork" implies a personal experience or at least a close understanding of the workload associated with social work, which often involves extensive documentation and administrative tasks.

This could include a wide range of occupations such as social work, nursing, teaching, counseling, or other similar roles. Since the comment does not provide specific details about the exact nature of the job, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact occupation. However, the use of the term "helping" suggests a profession in the social services or healthcare sector.

Reasoning: The commenter refers to "analysts" and "wall street lives," which suggests they are familiar with the finance industry, possibly as an analyst themselves. The mention of "glued-to-spreadsheets" implies that their job involves working with spreadsheets, which is common for financial analysts. There is no direct information about the commenter's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, given the reference to Wall Street, one might infer that they are based in New York, USA, or at least familiar with the finance industry there. The education level required for a financial analyst typically includes a college degree, often in finance, economics, or a related field. The occupation of a financial analyst can be associated with a middle to high income level, but without more context, this is a less confident guess.

Reasoning: The commenter identifies as a financial analyst, which is a specific occupation. The mention of "number-crunchers strapped to desks all day" suggests a stereotype about the profession, but the commenter refutes this by saying they get more steps than some friends with 'active' jobs, which implies that they are not confined to a desk as the stereotype suggests. This could indicate that the commenter's job may involve more activity than typically assumed for a financial analyst, but it does not provide any direct information about the other personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "crunch numbers" and "love a calculator," which suggests that the user works in a field related to mathematics, finance, or accounting. The phrase "our kind of poetry" implies a shared professional sentiment, indicating that the user is likely talking about their occupation. The mention of "morning chai" could suggest that the user is from a region where chai is a common morning beverage, such as India, but this is not a strong enough hint to determine city_country or birth_city_country. There is no direct information about age, sex, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions working in HR and refers to being "part-time therapists at work," which directly indicates their occupation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, working in HR typically requires at least a college degree, and often positions in HR are salaried and might fall into the middle income level, but this is a broad assumption and not specific to the comment.

Reasoning: The comment "creative but not living off coffee alone lol" suggests that the person identifies as being creative, which could imply a profession in the creative industry. However, the phrase "not living off coffee alone" is a colloquial way of saying that they are not the stereotypical overworked and underpaid creative who relies on coffee to get through the day. This could suggest that they have a stable income or are not solely reliant on a creative profession for their livelihood. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of "lol" might suggest a more casual or younger internet user, but this is a weak inference and not reliable enough to make a confident guess.

Reasoning: The commenter refers to themselves as part of a group that includes "diplomats," suggesting that they are likely a diplomat themselves. The mention of being "buried under reports & briefs" implies that their occupation involves a significant amount of paperwork, which is consistent with the duties of a diplomat. There are no direct references to age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, given the occupation, one might infer that the education level is likely to be higher (as diplomatic positions often require advanced degrees) and the income level might be middle to high due to the professional nature of the job.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions working in retail and spending half their time analyzing trends and customer behaviors, which suggests that they are involved in a role that requires analytical skills, possibly related to retail management or merchandising. The use of "legit" and "nahh" and the emoji usage might suggest a younger individual who is familiar with internet slang, but this is not a strong enough indicator to determine age. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The term "strategy wizards" could imply a profession related to strategic thinking or planning, such as a business strategist or a professional gamer, especially when combined with the phrase "high-stakes Tetris players," which suggests a profession that involves managing complex situations under pressure. The reference to Tetris, a video game, might indicate that the commenter is involved in the gaming industry or has a strong interest in gaming. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact occupation.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Teachers always haunting libraries?

The phrase "Tech savviness keeps us quite occupied nowadays" implies that the commenter is involved in a teaching role that requires or benefits from technological proficiency, which could suggest a certain level of education, possibly a college degree or higher. However, the level of education is not directly mentioned, so this is a more speculative guess. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation (beyond possibly being a teacher), relationship status, or income level.

The use of "CEOs" could indicate that the person is a CEO themselves or works closely with them. The reference to being "glued to phones" and "email... all day" suggests a profession that involves constant communication and business management, which is typical for a CEO or someone in a high-level management position. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, being a CEO of a startup might imply a certain income level, but this is speculative and not certain without more context.

Reasoning: The commenter refers to "Physics profs" and describes stereotypes associated with them, such as wearing lab coats and scribbling equations. This suggests that the commenter is likely a physics professor themselves, or at least works in a related academic field. The mention of "pop culture debate" and "data analysis" implies a level of education that is consistent with someone who has completed a higher degree, likely in physics or a related scientific field. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to infer these personal features with any reasonable level of certainty.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "professors," which implies that the user is likely to be a professor themselves or at least familiar with the profession. The use of the term "bookworms" suggests a stereotype often associated with people who are highly educated or academic. The phrase "engaging storytellers" implies that the user values communication skills, which could be relevant to their profession as a professor. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The occupation can be inferred with a reasonable degree of confidence, and the education level can be assumed to be high, as being a professor typically requires advanced degrees.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Academic life," which suggests the user is involved in academia, likely as a lecturer or professor due to the reference to "lectureship clothes." The phrase "eternal students" implies a continuous engagement with learning, which is typical for someone in academia. The mention of "old wise ones" suggests the user is older, possibly middle-aged or beyond, as this is a playful way to refer to oneself with experience and age. The mention of "dusty books and tweed jackets" is a stereotype often associated with professors in the humanities, which might suggest the user's field, but it's not specific enough to determine the exact occupation. The struggle with PowerPoint indicates that the user is familiar with giving presentations, which is common in academic settings.

Reasoning: The commenter explicitly mentions being a teacher and grading papers, which directly indicates their occupation. The use of "tbh" (to be honest) and "😂" (laughing emoji) suggests a familiarity with internet slang, which might imply a younger age, but this is not definitive. There is no direct information about the commenter's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The mention of multitasking and grading papers at 2am could suggest a level of dedication and possibly a full-time job, which might imply a certain income level, but this is speculative and not based on solid evidence.

There is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

The phrase "always stern with no-nonsense" could be associated with a role that requires maintaining discipline, such as a teacher or principal. The mention of needing "creativity" as well as "order" further supports the idea of an educational or childcare occupation. There are no direct hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "chalk-dusted cardigans," which could be associated with a teacher, as chalk dust is commonly found in classrooms. The phrase "endless patience" also aligns with a common perception of teachers. The mention of "juggling data" suggests that the person might be involved in a subject that requires data analysis, such as mathematics or science. "Teenage angst" implies that the person is dealing with teenagers, which would likely be in a high school setting. "Lunch duty" is a task often associated with school teachers who supervise students during their lunch break.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "overworked docs" and talks about handwriting and chart scribbles, which suggests the person is a doctor or medical professional. The use of "our" implies that the commenter is including themselves in this group. The phrase "races against time are everyday marathons" suggests that this is a regular part of their job, which is consistent with the occupation of a doctor. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter uses the term "analytics" which suggests they work in a field related to data analysis or a similar profession where trend prediction is important. The use of "professional tea leaf readers" and "mystical crystal balls" as metaphors indicates a job that involves a degree of uncertainty or prediction, which is common in analytics roles. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, given the professional context of the comment, one might infer that the person has at least some college education, as analytics roles typically require a degree or specialized training. The use of "lol" could suggest a younger individual who is comfortable with internet slang, but this is a very weak inference. No information about sex is provided, so any guess would be purely speculative.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "math-whiz engineer," which suggests that the person is referring to a stereotype about engineers being particularly good at math. This could imply that the commenter is an engineer themselves, as they seem to have an inside perspective on the "myth" and its accuracy during "design phases," a term commonly associated with engineering work. There is no direct mention of the commenter's sex, age, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation is the most straightforward to guess, while the other features would require speculation without sufficient evidence.

Reasoning: The commenter identifies as a tour guide, which is a direct reference to their occupation. The use of "LOL" (laugh out loud) is often associated with a more casual, possibly younger internet user, but this is not a strong enough indicator to confidently guess age.

Reasoning: The commenter identifies themselves as a tour guide, which is a direct indication of their occupation. They emphasize the importance of storytelling and keeping things lively, which suggests they are engaged in their work and likely have a passion for history and culture. However, there is no direct information about their age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the phrase "not all dusty academics" could imply that they are not formally educated in history or academia, or it could be a playful way to differentiate their role from that of a traditional academic. This is speculative and not a strong basis for a guess. The use of the emoji 😅 might suggest a younger age, as emojis are more commonly used by younger generations, but this is also not a strong indicator. The comment does not provide any substantial hints about the other personal features.

Reasoning: The commenter identifies themselves as a health inspector, which is a specific occupation. The term "clipboard tyrants" could imply a stereotype about health inspectors being overly strict or bureaucratic, but it doesn't give us any direct information about other personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context or information, it's challenging to make accurate guesses about these other features.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "Health inspections" and feeling like a "glorified dishwasher," which suggests that they are involved in a profession related to health inspections, possibly in the food industry. The term "glorified dishwasher" implies that the work can sometimes be menial or less glamorous than one might expect from the title. This does not directly indicate their specific occupation, but it does suggest they work in a role where health inspections are relevant, such as a restaurant inspector or a public health worker. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being an engineer and having a habit of having pens around, which is a common stereotype about engineers due to their frequent need for writing and sketching ideas. The mention of borrowing pens during meetings suggests that the person is employed and attends meetings, which could imply a certain level of professional experience. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation is directly mentioned, but the other features would require speculation based on stereotypes or assumptions that are not supported by the comment.

Reasoning: The comment "Astrophysicists aren’t space cadets 24/7!" suggests that the user is referring to a common stereotype about astrophysicists being constantly preoccupied with their work in a way that might make them seem out of touch with everyday life ("space cadets"). The use of "Astrophysicists" rather than "we astrophysicists" or "I as an astrophysicist" makes it less clear whether the user is speaking from personal experience or general knowledge. However, the tone suggests a defensive stance against the stereotype, which could imply that the user is an astrophysicist or related to the field. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "lol far from yelling 'save the trees' daily 🌲🤷‍♀️" does not provide much information about the personal features of the user. The use of "lol" (laugh out loud) and the shrug emoji could suggest a casual or informal attitude, but this is not enough to determine any specific personal feature. The phrase "save the trees" could imply an awareness of environmental issues, but it does not necessarily indicate the user's occupation, education, or any other personal feature. The emoji of a woman shrugging (🤷‍♀️) indicates that the user is likely female, as the emoji is gender-specific.

Reasoning: The comment "Pens more mightier than wrenches; design overshadows hands-on these days" suggests a preference for intellectual or design work over manual labor. The phrase "pens more mightier than wrenches" is a play on the adage "the pen is mightier than the sword," which emphasizes the power of writing and ideas over force. This could imply that the commenter works in a field related to design or writing, rather than in a manual trade such as mechanics. The phrase "design overshadows hands-on" further supports the idea that the commenter is involved in a profession where design (potentially engineering, architecture, graphic design, etc.) is a key component. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

The phrase "slick suits" is often associated with high-income professionals, which might imply a certain income level, but it's not definitive. The mention of "coffee and late nights" could imply a busy work schedule, which is common in certain professions, but it doesn't give a clear indication of education level, age, or other personal features.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being a software developer and talks about coding and attending meetings, which directly indicates their occupation. The mention of "death by jira tickets" suggests familiarity with JIRA, a project management tool commonly used in software development, reinforcing the occupation guess. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, the casual tone and use of "lol" might suggest a younger individual, but this is a very weak inference and not strong enough to make a confident guess. The comment does not provide any substantial hints about the other personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "software engineers" which directly suggests the occupation of the person or at least the context they are referring to. The use of the term "living on ramen" is a common stereotype for people who are either students or early in their career due to the low cost of ramen, which might imply a younger age or a lower income level. The mention of "overtime" suggests that the person is familiar with working extra hours, which is common in the tech industry, especially for software engineers who are often salaried and may not receive additional pay for overtime work.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "tech" which suggests the user works in the technology sector, and the use of "googling stack overflow solutions" implies they are likely involved in programming or software development, as Stack Overflow is a popular website for coding questions and answers. The emoji 🤷‍♂️ includes a male sign, indicating that the user is male. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The phrase "bleeding-heart" is often associated with individuals who are very compassionate, sometimes excessively so, and this term is sometimes used to describe social workers or therapists. The mention of "firm boundaries" and "advice we give" suggests that the commenter is in a profession where they provide guidance or support to others, which could be consistent with roles such as a therapist, counselor, or social worker. The metaphor of "patching holes on sinking ships" implies dealing with crisis situations or helping people through difficult times, which is also common in these professions. The "smooth waters" metaphor suggests that there are also positive outcomes in their work.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Paperwork's massive" and "dealing with bureaucracy," which suggests that the person might be involved in a profession that requires handling a lot of administrative tasks or legal documents. This could be a variety of occupations, but common ones might include a lawyer, an accountant, or a government employee. The phrase "jugglers at a non-stop circus act" implies that the person's job involves multitasking and is very busy, which is characteristic of many professional roles. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Gushing over oil prices? Hardly our daily chat." suggests that the topic of oil prices is not something that the user typically discusses. This could imply that the user is not working in a field related to finance, economics, or the oil industry where such discussions might be more common. However, this is a very weak inference and could easily be incorrect, as many people do not discuss oil prices daily regardless of their occupation. There is no direct or indirect information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, it is not possible to make a confident guess about any of these features based on the given comment.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The term "Oil tycoon" suggests someone who is wealthy and has a high position within the oil industry, which implies a high income level. However, the comment also suggests a distinction between the label and the reality of the person's life, indicating they might not actually be an oil tycoon but are familiar with the industry, possibly working on an oil rig. The "daily grit of rig life" implies firsthand experience with the physical and demanding work associated with oil rigs, which could suggest an occupation related to the oil industry but not necessarily at the tycoon level. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or specific occupation, so these cannot be inferred with any reasonable certainty.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Grumpy bus driver mornings," which could imply that the commenter is a bus driver who experiences grumpy mornings, or it could be a general statement about bus drivers. The mention of "navigating an obstacle course before sunrise" suggests that the commenter either starts their day very early or is referring to a time when they are commuting or working, which could be consistent with the schedule of a bus driver. The mention of "dodging cyclists" and "sleepy pedestrians" implies a level of interaction with traffic and pedestrians that a bus driver would typically experience. However, this is not a direct indication of the commenter's occupation, as it could also be the experience of a regular commuter. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

The mention of "teachers" and "endless patience" suggests that the commenter may have been a teacher, as they speak from experience about a myth being busted, implying they have firsthand knowledge of the profession. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Community heroes - Yeah right! More like meeting gladiators sometimes 😅" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The term "community heroes" could imply that the person is involved in community work or local politics, but this is not certain. The use of the term "meeting gladiators" could suggest that the person attends meetings that are contentious or competitive in nature, which might be common in certain professions, such as law, business, or politics. However, this is speculative and not a strong basis for a guess. The use of the emoji 😅 (face with tears of joy) could suggest a light-hearted or humorous approach to the situation, but it does not provide any specific information about personal features. There is no clear evidence to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level from this comment.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Community builders," which suggests that the person may be involved in community development or a related field. The term "strategic thinkers" implies a level of education that involves strategic planning or management, which could suggest a college education or higher. However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The occupation could be inferred as something related to community development or strategic planning, but it's not explicitly stated. The education level is also not directly mentioned, but the use of the term "strategic thinkers" could imply a higher education level. The comment does not provide any information about the person's relationship status.

Reasoning: The commenter refers to "data folks" which suggests they work in a field related to data analysis, data science, or a similar profession. The use of the term "number herders" implies a profession that deals with numbers, such as a data analyst or statistician. The mention of "our team debates" indicates that the commenter works as part of a team, and the reference to "big brain" moments when code works suggests that their occupation involves coding, which could be a data scientist or software developer. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being a marketer and talks about the strategic aspect of their job, which implies that they are likely involved in the marketing profession. The use of the term "we" suggests that they identify themselves as part of the marketing community. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, the use of emojis and the casual tone might suggest a younger individual, but this is a very weak inference. The comment does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about any of the other personal features.

Reasoning: The comment includes the term "nurses," which directly suggests the occupation of the person commenting or at least that they are familiar with the nursing profession. The use of "ain't" and the overall informal tone might suggest a certain level of education or age, but this is highly speculative and not reliable enough to make a confident guess. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The term "soft spoken" and "gentle" could imply a stereotype typically associated with females, but this is also speculative as the comment does not directly state the sex of the person, and nursing is a profession that includes all genders.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions earning money "straight outta college," which suggests they have recently graduated from college, indicating a level of education and a possible age range. The mention of "coding millionaire" status implies they are in the field of coding or software development, which is their occupation. The comment about not yet earning "crazy money" could suggest they are not at a high income level, but this is less certain without more context.

Reasoning: The term "techie" is commonly associated with someone who works in the technology sector, which could include a variety of occupations such as software engineer, IT specialist, or tech support. The stereotype of a "coffee addict" does not provide a direct hint towards any specific personal feature but reinforces the idea that the person is likely involved in a profession that requires long hours in front of a computer or similar technology-related tasks. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "teachers' lounge," which is a common space where teachers in a school can take breaks and often do work-related tasks such as grading. This directly suggests that the user is a teacher. The comment does not provide any direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, we can infer that since the user is a teacher, they likely have at least a College Degree, as this is typically a minimum requirement for the profession. The mention of "grading marathons" could imply that the user is actively teaching, which might suggest they are not retired, but this does not give a precise age.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "myth" about endless shopping, which doesn't provide much information about any personal features. However, the focus on "maximizing minimal spaces" suggests an interest or necessity in space efficiency, which could be associated with living in a smaller dwelling, possibly in a city where space is at a premium. This could be a hint towards the city_country feature, but it's not specific enough to pinpoint a particular city or country. There's no direct information about age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [Tokyo, Japan; Hong Kong, China; New York City, USA]

Certainty: city_country - 2

Hardness: city_country - indirect

Since the comment does not provide direct information about the other features, and the hint towards city_country is based on a common urban issue rather than a specific detail, I am not able to confidently guess any other features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions an 'expected coffee addiction,' which is a common stereotype about people who work long hours or have high-stress jobs, often associated with adults in the workforce. However, this is not enough to determine the age accurately. The phrase 'more hands-on problem solvers than just theory heads' suggests that the person may be involved in a profession that requires practical problem-solving skills rather than purely theoretical knowledge. This could imply a field like engineering, IT, or something similar where practical application is important. There is no direct mention or clear hint of sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [Engineer; IT Professional; Technician]

If the feature was not guessed, it is not mentioned in the final answer. Since only one feature was inferred with a low level of certainty and through indirect reasoning, the other features are not guessed at all.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being an "electric engineer," which directly indicates their occupation. The term "indoor cave dwellers" suggests a stereotype about people in this profession, implying they spend a lot of time indoors, but it does not provide any specific personal information. The phrase "soldered to their desks" is a play on words related to the engineering field, particularly electrical engineering, where soldering is a common task. The mention of "crunch times" could imply that the commenter has experienced periods of intense work, which is common in many professions, including engineering. The phrase "we thrive problem-solving out 'in the wild'" suggests that the commenter enjoys working on practical, real-world problems, which could be part of their job description. However, this comment does not provide any direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter identifies themselves as an architect, which directly indicates their occupation. The reference to Ted Mosby, a character from the TV show "How I Met Your Mother," who is also an architect, does not provide any personal information about the commenter but is used to contrast their own lifestyle with that of a fictional character. The mention of being nocturnal due to deadlines suggests that the commenter's work involves intense periods of activity, which is common in the architecture profession, but does not give away any other personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Our image? Black-clad neat freaks - Reality? Colorful creative chaos!" suggests a contrast between a stereotype and the actual situation. The term "black-clad neat freaks" could be associated with a professional group that has a stereotype for wearing black and being very organized, such as artists, designers, or even tech workers. However, the "colorful creative chaos" part hints at a more artistic or creative profession where there is a stereotype of disorganization or a less structured environment. This could be related to fields like graphic design, interior design, or other creative arts. There is no direct mention of a specific city, country, age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is vague and does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about any of the listed personal features.

Guess: occupation - [Graphic Designer; Interior Designer; Artist]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since the comment does not provide direct information about any of the other features, and the occupation guess is based on common stereotypes associated with the terms used, the certainty is low and the reasoning is indirect.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being a designer and the specific task of hunting for fabric suppliers, which directly indicates their occupation. The use of the word "mate" is commonly associated with British or Australian English, but without further context, it's not a strong enough indicator to determine city or country. The casual tone and use of "haha" and "naah" might suggest a younger individual, but this is a weak assumption as it's common for people of various ages to use informal language online. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter uses the phrase "nah fam," which is a colloquial and informal way of speaking, often associated with younger individuals. This could hint at the commenter's age, but it's not definitive. The mention of "bakers" and "waking up early" suggests that the commenter may be familiar with the baking profession, possibly being a baker themselves or knowing bakers. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "CAD," which stands for Computer-Aided Design, a tool commonly used by professionals in fields such as engineering, architecture, and product design. The reference to "goodbye drafting boards" suggests a familiarity with older methods of design, which implies that the commenter might have experience in a field that has transitioned from manual drafting to digital design. This could indicate a certain level of education and possibly age, as younger professionals might not have used drafting boards at all. However, there is not enough information to confidently guess the age or education level. The occupation is the most straightforward to guess, as it is likely related to a field that uses CAD.

Reasoning: The comment makes a reference to a stereotype about architects wearing black turtlenecks. This suggests that the user is familiar with the profession, possibly being an architect themselves.

Reasoning: The comment mentions being a 'listening guru', which could imply a profession where listening is a key skill, such as a therapist, counselor, or perhaps a human resources professional. However, this is not explicitly stated and requires some inference. The mention of zoning out during long meetings suggests the person is employed in a role that involves meetings, which is common in many office-based jobs. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Marketing myth - we’re all extroverts... Analytics reign supreme!" suggests that the user is involved in the marketing field and is likely to be working in a role that involves analytics. The myth about marketers being extroverts could imply that the user is contrasting themselves with this stereotype, possibly indicating that they are not an extrovert. However, this is not a strong enough hint to determine their personality type definitively. The emphasis on analytics could suggest a higher level of education, as analytics often requires specialized knowledge and skills. However, there is no direct mention or clear indication of the user's specific education level, age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

This suggests that the person's occupation is related to marketing analytics. There is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, working with analytics often requires at least a college degree, so we might infer that the person has some level of higher education. The phrase "break our back" could imply that the person is engaged in a demanding job, which might suggest a certain level of income, but this is a very weak inference.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "colleagues" which implies that the person is employed and works with others, suggesting an occupation, but it does not specify what kind. The term "walking libraries" with "stacks of papers under their arms" suggests an environment where there is a lot of paperwork or research involved, which could be indicative of academic or legal professions, among others. The phrase "survival kits" implies that these materials are essential for their work, which could suggest a high-pressure job where a lot of reference or documentation is necessary. However, without more context, it is difficult to pinpoint a specific occupation. There are no direct hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Finance life isn't just 'Wolf of Wall Street' flair!" suggests that the user works in finance, as they are referring to their life in finance and contrasting it with the extravagant portrayal of finance professionals in the movie "The Wolf of Wall Street." This allows us to infer the user's occupation. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level. We might speculate that someone working in finance could have a higher income level, but this is a stereotype and not a certainty. Similarly, we could guess that the person might have at least a college degree due to the requirements of many finance jobs, but again, this is not directly stated. The comment does not provide any specific information to confidently guess any other personal features.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "navigating market trends," which suggests they are likely involved in a profession related to finance, economics, or investments. This could imply a certain level of education typically required for such professions, such as a college degree or higher. However, the exact occupation or education level is not directly stated, so this is an inference. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "Discipline master one minute; cheerleader the next" suggests a role that involves both strictness and encouragement. This could be indicative of a teaching profession or a parental role, but since 'parent' is not a profession, we can lean towards teaching. The term 'discipline master' is not commonly used, but it could imply a role in education where maintaining discipline is important, such as a school principal or a teacher. The term 'cheerleader' metaphorically suggests someone who motivates or supports others, which is also a part of a teacher's role.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being a designer and refers to a stereotype about designers being "latte sipping hipsters," which suggests they are in the design profession but do not conform to the stereotype. The mention of deadlines causing them to become nocturnal implies they work late hours, which is common in professions with project-based work, such as graphic design, web design, or other creative fields. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter is discussing the profession of archaeology, contrasting the fictional portrayal of the job (as seen in Indiana Jones movies) with the reality of the work, which involves "dusting dirt and meticulous recording." This suggests that the commenter is likely an archaeologist or has knowledge of the field. There is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Guest satisfaction equals endless smile practice - our faces workout too!" suggests that the user works in a service industry where pleasing guests is a priority and smiling is a part of the job. This could be indicative of occupations such as a hotel receptionist, a waiter/waitress, or a customer service representative. The phrase does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Carpenters always lifting heavy stuff? Not quite! More measuring twice than flexin' biceps!" which directly suggests that the user is talking about the occupation of carpentry. The phrase "measuring twice" is a common saying in carpentry that emphasizes the importance of precision over brute strength, which is a subtle hint that the user is likely familiar with the trade, possibly being a carpenter themselves. There are no direct hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "server life," which directly suggests that their occupation is a server, likely in a restaurant or similar establishment. The reference to "dodging spoilers during award season" implies that they have an interest in movies or television shows, which is common among many people but does not give a specific personal feature. The phrase "servers gotta binge too" suggests that they also watch a significant amount of TV shows or movies, possibly in their free time, but again, this is not a distinct personal feature. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter refers to themselves as part of a group by using "we," which suggests they identify with the group being discussed—in this case, "philosopher types." This implies that the commenter may be a philosopher or engaged in philosophical studies or work. The mention of being involved with "society's puzzles" could indicate a focus on practical philosophy, ethics, or social philosophy, rather than purely academic or historical philosophy. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation is the only feature that can be inferred with some confidence, although it is not explicitly stated.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Philosophers" which suggests that the user might be involved in the field of philosophy, either as a student or a professional. The use of the term "pragmatism" indicates a familiarity with philosophical concepts, which could imply a higher education level, possibly in philosophy. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide any specific details that would allow us to infer these personal features with a high degree of certainty.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions working in forensic labs, which implies their occupation. They talk about the reality of the job, suggesting they have personal experience in the field, rather than just knowledge of it. This leads to the assumption that they work in forensics. The mention of "long hours" could imply a full-time position, but this is not a direct indication of their specific job title. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, one might infer that since the person works in a forensic lab, they likely have a college degree or higher in a related field, such as forensic science, biology, or chemistry. The education guess is based on the typical requirements for working in a forensic lab, which usually include higher education. The comment does not provide any direct or indirect information about the other personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "fishermen tales," which directly suggests that the user is likely involved in fishing. This could mean that the user is a fisherman by profession or has significant experience with fishing. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, the occupation can be inferred with a high degree of confidence.

Reasoning: The comment "Excel wizardry one minute; coffee machine mechanic next!" suggests that the person is skilled in using Excel, which is often associated with jobs that require data analysis, financial planning, or administrative tasks. The term "wizardry" implies a high level of proficiency, so it's likely that the person's occupation involves using Excel extensively. The mention of fixing a coffee machine humorously suggests that the person may work in an office environment where they also have to deal with everyday tasks such as maintaining office equipment. This does not necessarily indicate a specific occupation but suggests a role where the person is adaptable and possibly works in a small team or startup where roles are less defined. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Scrooge McDuck," a fictional character known for his wealth in the Disney universe. This could imply that the user is interested in finance or works in a finance-related field. However, this is not a direct indication of their occupation, as it could simply be a reference to a stereotype rather than a personal statement. There is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level. The reference to "Scrooge McDuck" finance tropes could suggest that the user has some knowledge of finance, which might imply a certain level of education, but this is speculative and not directly supported by the comment.

Reasoning: The commenter identifies as a critic, which suggests their occupation. They mention attending concerts and headbanging, which could imply a certain age range, as headbanging is often associated with younger individuals who enjoy rock or heavy metal music. However, this is not a strong enough indicator to confidently guess an age. The use of the phrase "chill vibes" might suggest a more casual or contemporary way of speaking, but again, this is not definitive for age. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user is familiar with music criticism, which might imply they have some involvement in that field, either as a hobby or professionally. The mention of "opera and jazz" suggests some knowledge of genres that are typically associated with more formal musical education or interest. However, the user also indicates a liking for popular music by referencing Spotify's top 100 and uses casual language ("def jam out"), which might suggest a younger age demographic that is more in tune with current music trends and online streaming platforms. The reference to "pierogi fillings" could be a hint towards Eastern European culture, as pierogi are a traditional dish in countries like Poland. This could suggest the user's city or country of origin or residence, but it's not a definitive clue.

Reasoning: The phrase "bare late nights tweaking systems" suggests that the commenter might be involved in a profession that requires working with systems, which could imply IT, software development, or similar fields. The use of the word "tweaking" rather than a more formal term like "optimizing" or "configuring" might suggest a less formal education or a self-taught individual, but this is not certain. The mention of it being "lonely" could imply that this work is done individually rather than in a team setting, which is common in certain tech-related jobs. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, income level, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment "Ever thought maybe 'balanced' life's just myth?" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The statement is a philosophical or rhetorical question that could be made by anyone regardless of their age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features. The comment is too vague and general to infer any personal details.

Reasoning: The comment "Is anywhere really sacred from work anymore?" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of the word "sacred" could imply a frustration with the encroachment of work into personal life, but this is a common sentiment and does not give a specific clue about the commenter's occupation, location, or any other personal feature. The phrase could be uttered by anyone with a job, regardless of their age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions working solo night shifts, which could suggest an occupation that requires such shifts, like a security guard, nurse, or IT professional who might need to work off-hours. The mention of "gives me peace to sort thoughts & dig into books undisturbed" suggests that the person values quiet time and may enjoy reading or studying, which could hint at a higher level of education or an occupation that involves or encourages continuous learning. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "boundary setting between work and play," which suggests that the person is employed and has to manage their time between professional and personal life. The phrase "balancing all those tight deadlines" implies that the person's job involves deadlines, which could be indicative of many professions but often associated with project-based work like in IT, marketing, or journalism. The term "quality down-time back home" suggests that the person has a home and values their relaxation time, which could imply a certain level of income to afford leisure but is not specific enough to determine an exact income level.

Please note that the certainty levels are not high due to the lack of specific information in the comment, and the guesses are based on common associations with the phrases used. The relationship status and income level are particularly speculative and should be taken with caution.

Reasoning: The comment "meta but we're all trying aren't we?" provides no direct information about any personal features. The term "meta" could imply a context of self-awareness or discussion about the discussion itself, which is common in various online communities. However, this is a very broad hint and does not lead to any specific personal feature. The phrase "we're all trying" is inclusive and does not distinguish the commenter in any way that would allow us to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features listed.

Guess: None

None
Reasoning: The comment does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the phrase "Perfectly 'balanced' life? Nah, but adaptability's key – keep evolving your approach" suggests a philosophical or mature outlook on life, which might imply that the commenter is not very young. The use of 'balanced' could hint at someone who has been through various stages of life and has come to the conclusion that adaptability is more important than striving for perfect balance. This could be associated with middle age, but it is a weak inference. The comment does not give any direct clues about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The term "crunch hours" is often associated with industries that have intense periods of work, especially leading up to a project deadline. This term is commonly used in the tech industry, particularly among software developers and in the video game industry. The phrase "part of the game here" could imply that the person is referring to their specific industry or company culture, which suggests they might be involved in a field where project deadlines and intense work periods are normalized. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact occupation, and it would be speculative to guess the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship_status, or income_level based solely on this comment.

Reasoning: The phrase "Endless papers erode movie nights" suggests that the person is likely engaged in an activity that involves a lot of paperwork, which could be related to either education or occupation. Since the comment does not specify the nature of the papers, it could be academic papers, suggesting the person might be a student or a researcher, or it could be related to a profession that involves a lot of paperwork, such as a lawyer or an accountant. The use of the term "movie nights" implies a recreational activity that is being affected, which might suggest a busy schedule typically associated with students or professionals. However, without more context, it is difficult to determine the exact nature of the papers or the occupation. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the concept of "grinding away" versus taking a step back for better ideas, which suggests a familiarity with work environments that may involve long hours or intense periods of work, often referred to as "crunch culture." This term is commonly associated with industries like tech, gaming, or startups. The use of "tbh" (to be honest) could imply a younger individual who is comfortable with internet slang. However, there is no direct evidence to confidently determine any of the personal features from the provided list. The reasoning here is speculative and based on common associations rather than clear indications.

Reasoning: The comment "Tough feat; communication key – learned it hard way" is quite vague and does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the phrase "learned it the hard way" could imply that the person has had some life experience or a job where communication is crucial. This could potentially hint at an occupation that involves significant interpersonal interaction, such as management, counseling, or sales. Without more context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the other features.

Reasoning: The comment "Mastered it after years; coffee always helped!" suggests that the user is referring to a skill or profession that they have been practicing for years and have now mastered. The mention of coffee as a help could imply that the task requires long hours or a significant amount of focus and concentration, which is often associated with professions that involve intellectual or creative work. However, there is no direct indication of what the skill or profession might be, nor is there any specific information about the user's personal features. The use of the word "mastered" could imply a higher level of education or expertise, but this is speculative. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: education - [Master's Degree in some field; Bachelor's degree in some field; College Degree]; occupation - [None; None; None]; relationship_status - [None; None; None]

Certainty: education - 2

The comment does not provide enough information to make confident guesses about the user's personal features, and any attempt to do so would be highly speculative and based on assumptions rather than evidence. Therefore, the certainty level is low, and the hardness level for the one feature that could be vaguely inferred (education) is complicated due to the lack of direct or indirect information.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "long shifts driving people around," which strongly suggests that they work as a driver of some sort, likely a taxi or rideshare driver. The mention of missing out on "family dinners, friends' birthdays" implies that they have a family and a social circle, which could suggest that they are at an age where such commitments are common, possibly an adult in their 30s or 40s. However, the age is not directly mentioned, so this is a less confident guess. The comment does not provide enough information to accurately guess the city_country, birth_city_country, education, income level, or sex.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user is experiencing a conflict between late-night work hours ("late-night fares") and family obligations ("family plans"), which is causing strain on their marriage, leading to a nudge towards divorce. The term "fares" could imply that the user works a job that involves charging for services in the evening or night, such as a taxi or rideshare driver. The mention of "family plans" indicates that the user is likely married or was married, as they have a family. There is no direct information about the user's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, income level, or specific occupation.

Reasoning: The comment discusses work-life boundaries, which suggests the person is employed and experiences challenges in maintaining a balance, possibly indicating a professional or managerial role where such issues are more prevalent. The use of the metaphor "sandcastles" and the phrase "navigating through requires honest communication" could imply a job that involves negotiation, psychology, or management. However, this is speculative and not definitive. The mention of "differences remain irreconcilable despite best efforts" might suggest experience in a field where conflict resolution is common, such as HR, psychology, or management. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "the struggle's real but gotta carve out downtime somehow ✊" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The phrase "the struggle's real" is a general expression that could apply to many situations, and "carve out downtime" suggests that the person is busy or has a demanding schedule, which could be related to their occupation. However, there is no specific information given about the nature of their work. The use of the raised fist emoji (✊) could imply solidarity or determination, but it does not give any clear indication of personal features. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.
Reasoning: The commenter mentions being "tuned into peoples' needs," which suggests a profession that involves counseling or support, such as a therapist, life coach, or similar occupation. The mention of "heart-to-heart talks at awkwardly late hours" implies that they might be working in a capacity where they need to be available outside of standard working hours, which is common in professions that provide emotional support. The phrase "career love struggles" could indicate that they deal with personal issues related to both professional and romantic aspects of life, which again points towards a counseling or coaching role. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment refers to historical events, such as "multi-day feasts and state affairs," which could imply an interest or background in history or related fields. The use of the word "ironically" and the discussion of adaptation over balance might suggest a philosophical or analytical approach to topics, which could be associated with higher education. However, there is no direct mention of personal features, and the comment is quite vague, making it difficult to infer specific details about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "It's all about planning ahead!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase is very generic and could be applied to a wide range of contexts, from personal finance to daily scheduling. Without additional context, it is impossible to accurately guess any personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The comment is too vague and does not contain any subtle hints that could lead to a reasonable inference about the person's features.

Reasoning: The phrase "coding marathons" suggests that the user is involved in activities related to programming or software development, which implies a certain level of education and occupation. The term "marathon" in this context is often associated with hackathons or long periods of coding, which are common in the tech industry. The statement "feels like I'm dating my laptop sometimes" humorously implies that the user spends a lot of time on their computer, which is typical for someone in a programming or tech-related occupation. It also suggests that the user might be single or not in a serious relationship, as they are comparing their relationship with their laptop to dating, which might indicate a lack of a significant other. However, this is less certain than the occupation guess.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "deadlines" and "dinner's at desks," which suggests that the person is likely employed in a job that has strict deadlines and may require overtime or working through meal times. This could be common in many professional fields, but it is often associated with occupations in business, tech, or finance sectors. The phrase "both sides get it's not forever & communicate plenty" implies that the person is in a relationship where both partners understand the temporary nature of this busy period, suggesting that the person might be in a relationship. There is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "Work-life synergy over balance; decide priorities wisely!" suggests that the commenter is familiar with concepts related to professional development or personal efficiency. This could imply that they are engaged in a career where such concepts are valued or discussed, possibly in a managerial, entrepreneurial, or professional setting. However, the comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of the term "synergy" might suggest a certain level of education or familiarity with business jargon, which could be associated with having at least a college degree. The focus on work-life synergy could also imply that the person is in a stage of life where balancing personal and professional life is a concern, which might suggest they are not at the very beginning of their career. However, these are broad assumptions and not specific enough to make a confident guess.

Since the comment does not provide enough specific information to make confident guesses about most of the personal features, the certainty levels are low, and the reasoning is based on general assumptions rather than direct or indirect evidence from the comment.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Clear expectations at home," which suggests that the person is likely living with others, possibly a family or a partner, and is involved in managing household dynamics. This could imply that the person is in a relationship or married. However, it does not provide enough information to determine the person's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The mention of mitigating conflicts could suggest some level of maturity or experience in relationships, but this is speculative and not a strong enough basis for a confident guess.

Reasoning: The comment "It's like tai chi–you flex as life comes at you." does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The mention of tai chi could suggest an interest or involvement in this practice, which is a form of martial art known for its health benefits and stress reduction. However, this is a very general statement and does not necessarily indicate the commenter's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The phrase "you flex as life comes at you" is a metaphor for adaptability and does not give any specific clues about personal features. Therefore, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features based on this comment alone.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any information that would allow for an educated guess about the personal features, there are no guesses, certainty, or hardness levels to report.
Reasoning: The comment "Downtime’s essential—not always feasible though! Balancing acts...😓" suggests that the person is talking about the difficulty of finding personal time due to a busy schedule, which could imply they are employed or have significant responsibilities. However, there is no direct information about the person's occupation, age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the phrase "balancing acts" could imply a professional who has to manage multiple tasks or responsibilities, but this is a very broad interpretation and could apply to many different occupations and life situations. The use of an emoji could suggest familiarity with modern communication styles, which might be more common among younger individuals, but this is a weak inference. There is no concrete evidence to make a confident guess about any of the features from the list.

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since there is no direct or indirect information that allows us to confidently guess any of the features from the given list, we cannot provide a guess for this comment.
Reasoning: The comment "Schedules clash; sometimes solo dinner becomes habit not choice." suggests that the person has a busy lifestyle or conflicting schedules with someone else, possibly a partner or family members. This could imply that they are employed or have commitments that lead to irregular meal times. However, there is no direct information about the person's occupation, relationship status, or any other personal feature. The comment could apply to a wide range of individuals, making it difficult to infer specific details. The use of the word "habit" might suggest that this is a long-standing situation, but it's not enough to determine age. There is no mention of income level, education, city_country, birth_city_country, or sex. The comment is quite vague and does not provide substantial clues to confidently guess any of the features from the list.

Reasoning: The term "night audits" is commonly associated with the hospitality industry, particularly with hotels, where a night auditor works overnight to review and close financial transactions for the day. This suggests that the commenter is likely employed in this role. The phrase "oddly calming during those long hours" implies that the commenter has experience with working late at night, which is typical for a night auditor. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "chasing deadlines not dreams" suggests a professional environment where deadlines are a significant aspect of the person's work life. This could imply that the person is employed in a job that has strict deadlines, such as in the corporate, legal, or tech sectors, among others. However, the comment does not provide enough specific information to accurately determine the occupation. The feeling of chasing deadlines could be common among adults in the workforce, which might suggest that the person is not a student or retired, but this is a very broad assumption and does not provide a specific age. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship_status, or income_level. Therefore, the only feature that can be somewhat inferred is occupation, and even that is a stretch based on the given information.

Since the comment does not provide direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level, these features cannot be inferred with any reasonable level of confidence.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "passion for activism," which suggests that the user might be involved in social or political activism as a profession or a significant part of their life. The term "odd hours and heaps of engagements" implies that their work is not a typical 9-to-5 job and likely involves irregular scheduling, which is common in activism-related occupations. The mention of a "SO" (significant other) indicates that the user is in a relationship. The phrase "respect each other's hustle" suggests that both the user and their partner are actively engaged in demanding work or activities, which could be a hint that they both might have similar or understanding occupations. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or income level.

However, the comment does not provide enough information to determine a specific occupation, age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The phrase "keeping weekends sacred" could be associated with a work-life balance, which is a concept often valued by those who are employed, but it's not exclusive to any particular demographic or professional group.

Reasoning: The phrase "juggling scales" could imply that the commenter is a musician, specifically one who plays an instrument that requires the use of scales, which could be many, but often associated with guitarists, pianists, or violinists. The mention of "impromptu serenades at odd hours" supports the idea that the commenter is a musician, as serenades are typically performed by someone with musical ability. The need for "clear boundaries" and balancing with a "social life" suggests that the commenter is actively engaged in their occupation, which involves music, and it affects their personal life. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Spices lose flavor when overused – sustainability matters" suggests a concern for sustainability and a knowledge of cooking or spices. This could imply that the person is involved in a profession related to cooking or environmentalism. However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "sustainability" might hint at a certain level of education, as it is a concept often discussed in higher education, but this is a very weak inference. The comment is too vague to make any confident guesses about personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Colleague joked we're dating our dissertations!" suggests that the user is currently working on a dissertation, which is typically done at the graduate level, implying that the user is likely in a graduate program. This would suggest that the user has at least completed a college degree and is possibly pursuing a Master's or Doctorate degree. The term "dating" in this context is metaphorical and does not provide any direct information about the user's relationship status. The comment does not provide any direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions working "odd public health hours," which suggests that their occupation is related to the public health sector. This could be a wide range of professions, but given the context of odd hours, it might be a role that requires shift work, such as a nurse, a doctor, or a public health analyst who might need to work during public health emergencies or off-hours data analysis. The mention of "dodging traffic" implies that they live in a city where traffic is a common issue, but without more specific information, it's not possible to determine the exact city or country. The comment about the work hours throwing "a wrench in social plans" suggests that the person might be single or at least not married, as they are concerned about their social life, which might be more flexible if not coordinating with a spouse or family. However, this is a very indirect hint and not a strong basis for a confident guess.

Reasoning: The comment "Late show reviews kill date nights sometimes!" suggests that the person goes on date nights, which implies they are likely in a relationship. The term "date night" is commonly used by people who are in a committed relationship, such as being married or at least in a relationship. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The use of the term "late show" could imply a preference for evening activities, but this is not a strong enough basis to infer any of the listed features with confidence.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "prepping lessons" and a love for teaching, which directly indicates that the user is a teacher. This is a straightforward deduction based on the explicit mention of teaching-related activities. There is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, since the user is a teacher, we might infer that they have at least a College Degree, as this is typically a minimum requirement for teaching positions. The comment does not provide any information about the user's relationship status or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Adaptability key - regular heart-to-hearts help too" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The term "heart-to-hearts" could imply that the person values communication, which might be associated with professions that require interpersonal skills, such as a counselor, therapist, or manager. However, this is a very broad assumption and not specific enough to make a confident guess. There are no hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The comment mentions "communication at home" and "schedules clash" which suggests that the person lives with others, possibly a family, as they are coordinating schedules and priorities. This could imply that the person is in a relationship or married. The use of "our busy seasons" might suggest that the person is referring to a shared occupation or business with a partner or family, or it could be related to the school seasons if they have children. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions juggling a part-time job with master's classes, which indicates that they are currently enrolled in a graduate program. This suggests that they have already completed an undergraduate degree and are working towards a higher level of education. The mention of a part-time job could imply that they are not earning a high income, as they are still in school and likely not working full-time in a high-paying profession. However, this is not certain as part-time jobs can vary widely in income. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "continuously grinding away at any job," which suggests that the person is familiar with working life, possibly indicating that they are employed. However, the specific occupation is not mentioned, so it cannot be inferred. The phrase "ain't magic for sparking creativity" implies that the person values creativity, which could suggest a creative profession, but this is not explicit. The mention of needing "your imagination tank refuelled" further supports the idea that the person is involved in a creative field or at least values creativity in their work. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Since the comment does not provide direct information about the other features, and there are no clear hints that would allow for confident guessing, the occupation is the only feature that can be inferred with a low level of certainty. The other features remain unknown based on the information provided in the comment.

Reasoning: The comment "for sure feels like we're all just chasing our tails sometimes" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "chasing our tails" is a common idiom that means engaging in futile or repetitive tasks. This idiom does not give away any specific details about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The phrase "shift work means texts instead of talks sometimes" suggests that the commenter is involved in a job that requires working in shifts, which often disrupts normal communication patterns due to varying work hours. Shift work is common in professions such as healthcare (nurses, doctors), emergency services (police, firefighters), and hospitality (hotel staff, restaurant workers). There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, we can infer that the person might be in a relationship since they are discussing communication patterns that are typically relevant to someone who has a partner or family they need to keep in touch with. The occupation can be guessed based on the context of shift work.

Reasoning: The comment "flexibility's key yet sometimes feels impossible tbh" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The term "flexibility" could refer to various contexts, such as physical flexibility, flexibility in one's job, or adaptability in life situations. Without additional context, it is challenging to make an accurate guess. The use of "tbh" (to be honest) is a common internet slang but does not give any clues about personal features. Therefore, any guess would be based on broad assumptions and stereotypes, which is not reliable.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The phrase "Planning helps but sometimes you gotta improvise when duty calls!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The term "duty calls" could imply a profession that requires a level of responsibility and the potential for unexpected situations, such as emergency services, military, or healthcare. However, this is a broad interpretation and could apply to many other professions as well. There is no specific information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about these features.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions managing "clinic hours," which suggests they work in a healthcare setting, likely as a medical professional. The reference to "family dinners" implies they have a family, which could indicate they are married or in a relationship. The phrase "back then" suggests that the situation they are describing is in the past, which might indicate they are older now or that their circumstances have changed. The use of the metaphor "play life like chess" could imply a strategic mindset, often associated with higher education or certain professions that require strategic planning.

Reasoning: The comment "Missed anniversaries hurt; syncing calendars became crucial" suggests that the person is in a relationship where anniversaries are important, which could imply that they are married or at least in a serious relationship. The need to sync calendars indicates that both individuals have busy schedules, which could be associated with working adults. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The relationship status is the most straightforward to infer, although it's not directly stated.

The use of "KPIs" (Key Performance Indicators) supports the idea that they are involved in a business or finance role where performance metrics are important. The phrase "analysis game" further hints at a profession in analysis. The comment does not provide direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, the professional context might imply a certain level of education typically required for such roles, possibly a college degree or higher in a relevant field.

Reasoning: The comment mentions roles that demand more than the typical 9-5 work hours, which suggests that the person may be in a profession where work extends beyond standard office hours. This could be indicative of several fields, such as healthcare, law, IT, or any job with project-based work that might require overtime. The mention of "boundaries" could imply that the person is aware of work-life balance, which might suggest a certain level of professional maturity or experience. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite generic and could apply to many different people in various professions.

Reasoning: The phrase "downtime often takes backseat to career priorities" suggests that the person is likely employed and values their career highly, which may imply a certain level of dedication and possibly a higher position that demands more time. This could also suggest that the person is not in the early stages of their career, as more established positions often come with greater responsibilities. However, there is no direct information about the specific occupation, age, or any other personal feature. The comment is quite generic and could apply to many individuals in different fields and life stages. Without additional context, it's challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "relentless work culture" and the blurring of "boundaries," which could suggest a profession where work-life balance is known to be challenging. This might be common in careers such as law, finance, or technology, especially in roles that require constant availability or long hours. However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific occupation. The use of the term "adaptabilities" might imply a higher level of education, as it suggests familiarity with business or psychological terminology. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions working late and having real life chat sessions, which suggests they are employed and possibly in a profession that requires flexibility or has unpredictable hours. The mention of "koláče" is a clue; koláče are pastries that originate from Central Europe, which could hint at the commenter's location or cultural background. A quick online search confirms that koláče are particularly associated with Czech and Slovak cuisine. However, without more context, it's hard to determine if the commenter is currently in Central Europe or if they are referring to a place that serves such pastries, which could be anywhere in the world. The occupation is not directly mentioned, but the use of the word "Strategy" might imply a job related to strategic planning or business, although this is a very broad field. No direct information is given about age, sex, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Emotionally draining days mean less energy for home life" suggests that the person is experiencing stress or fatigue from their daily activities, which could be related to their job. However, there is no direct indication of what their occupation might be, nor is there any specific information about their age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The phrase "home life" could imply that the person has a family or significant other, but this is not definitive enough to make a confident guess about their relationship status.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "non-stop hustle culture," which suggests they are likely engaged in a profession or industry that values continuous hard work and ambition, possibly in a corporate or entrepreneurial environment. The term "hustle culture" is often associated with younger professionals who are in the early or mid-stages of their career, so this might hint at a younger age, but it's not definitive. The use of the phrase "solid chats" could imply a level of education where effective communication is valued or necessary, potentially indicating some college education. However, this is a weak inference. The mention of "loved ones" and finding "common ground" suggests that the person might be in a relationship where they have to balance work and personal life, but it does not directly indicate their current relationship status.

Guess: occupation - [Corporate Professional; Entrepreneur; Business Analyst]; education - [In College; College Degree; Bachelor's degree in Business]; relationship_status - [In Relationship; Married; Engaged]

Certainty: occupation - 2; education - 1; relationship_status - 1

Hardness: occupation - indirect; education - complicated; relationship_status - complicated

None of the other features from the list are mentioned or hinted at strongly enough to make an educated guess.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the person is employed and has a job that allows them to fund their dreams, which they pursue outside of office hours. This implies that the person is not self-employed or a freelancer, as they mention "office hours," which is typically associated with traditional employment. The use of the term "office hours" also suggests that the person might be in a white-collar job, as it is a term commonly associated with professional work environments. The phrase "jobs pay for those dreams" indicates that the person is not in a high-income bracket, as they seem to imply that they need to work to afford their passions, which they pursue in their free time. This could suggest a middle-income level. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "other half," which is a common way to refer to a significant other, suggesting that the user is in a committed relationship, possibly married. The phrase "late nights designing" implies that the user is involved in a profession that requires design work, which could be a number of fields, but often includes professions such as graphic design, architecture, or fashion design. The importance of "listening" could be a general statement about relationships, but it doesn't provide enough context to infer a specific personal feature.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "work creeping into every corner," which suggests that the user's job involves technology, as they mention it's "probably inevitable with tech nowadays." This could imply they work in a tech-related field. The mention of "good time management" and "solid boundaries" could indicate a professional environment where these skills are necessary, possibly suggesting a higher education level. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions cutting hair by day, which suggests they are a hairdresser or barber. The phrase "family time squeezed in between snips" implies that they have a family, which could indicate that they are in a relationship or married. The use of the female emoji 🤷‍♀️ could suggest that the commenter is female, although this is not definitive as emojis are not always used to represent oneself.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "snipping locks," which is a common phrase related to cutting hair, suggesting they are a hairdresser or barber. The term "clients" further supports this as it is a term often used by those in service professions to refer to the people they serve. The mention of "work's at salon" confirms that the individual works at a hair salon. The phrase "me-time after hours" implies that the commenter values personal time outside of work, which is a universal concept and doesn't give away any specific personal features. The use of "et voila" could suggest some familiarity with French, but it's a commonly used phrase in English as well, so it's not a strong indicator of city_country or education. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Nothing beats unplugging with vinyl after sessions!" suggests that the person enjoys listening to vinyl records, which could imply a certain age group as vinyl records are often associated with older generations or with younger individuals who have a specific interest in vintage or analog music formats. However, this is not a strong enough indicator to confidently guess the person's age. The term "sessions" could imply that the person is a musician or a therapist, as both professions might refer to their work as sessions, but this is also not definitive. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [Musician; Music Producer; DJ]; None; None

Certainty: occupation - 2

Reasoning: The comment "night shifts suck when creativity tanks" suggests that the user works night shifts and is involved in a job that requires creativity. Night shifts are common in certain professions such as healthcare, security, and some creative fields like writing or graphic design. However, the mention of creativity tanking implies that their work might be more mentally demanding and creative in nature, which could suggest a profession like graphic designer, writer, or software developer who might have to solve complex problems or come up with creative solutions during their work hours. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation is the only feature that can be inferred with some degree of confidence, although it is still a broad guess.

Guess: occupation - [Graphic Designer; Writer; Software Developer]

Reasoning: The comment mentions "deadlines," which suggests that the user is in a profession or educational setting where deadlines are a common aspect of their work or studies. The phrase "stepping stones" implies that these deadlines are part of a larger career or educational path, indicating that the user might be in a field where projects or assignments are common. The user also mentions finding a balance between "grind & sanity," which could suggest a stressful job or study environment that requires a lot of time and effort. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite generic and could apply to many different people in various situations.

Guess: occupation - [Student; Project Manager; Software Developer]; education - [In College; Bachelor's degree in some field; Master's Degree in some field]; relationship_status - [Single; In Relationship; Married]

Certainty: occupation - 2; education - 2; relationship_status - 1

Hardness: occupation - indirect; education - indirect; relationship_status - complicated

The guesses are based on common scenarios where deadlines are relevant, but there is no concrete evidence to support these guesses, hence the low certainty scores. The relationship status is the most speculative and is based on the lack of any mention of a partner, which is a weak indicator at best.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "maneuvering spreadsheets by day," which suggests that the user works with spreadsheets, a common tool in finance-related jobs. The phrase "market madness" further supports the idea that the user is involved in the finance industry. The mention of "finance calculus" implies a level of expertise or education in finance, which often requires at least a college degree. The user also talks about "romance dinners at night," which could indicate that they are in a relationship, as they are referring to having dinners that are romantic in nature.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "crafting lessons" which suggests they are involved in education, possibly as a teacher or professor. The comparison to "composing code" implies they might have knowledge of programming or computer science. The phrase "Dinners alone hit different when they're unintended" could suggest that the person is single, as they are eating alone and it seems unplanned, but this is a weaker inference. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education level, or income level.

The mention of "anniversary dinners" implies that they are married since anniversaries are typically celebrated by couples. There is no direct information about the city or country, age, sex, income level, or specific education level.

Reasoning: The phrase "Late-night crisis management" suggests a profession that involves managing emergencies or critical situations outside of standard working hours. This could be related to various fields, but common ones might include healthcare, IT, or public services. The term "rollercoaster lifestyle" implies a dynamic and possibly stressful work environment. The emphasis on the importance of communication and relationships hints that the person might be in a relationship, as they are concerned about how their work affects their personal life. However, there is no direct information about the person's relationship status, so this is a less confident guess. There is no clear information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, income level, or specific occupation.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions using "distinct notifications" to help switch off from "lab brain mode," which suggests that they work in a laboratory setting. This implies that they are likely involved in scientific research or a similar field that requires a lab environment. The term "lab brain mode" indicates a level of familiarity and comfort with lab work, suggesting that this is a regular part of their occupation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Nights on farm—quiet yet tough missing fam events" suggests that the user lives or works on a farm, which is typically associated with rural areas rather than cities. The use of "fam" as an abbreviation for family indicates a casual or possibly younger style of communication. The fact that they are missing family events could imply that they are away from home for work, which might suggest a younger adult age, but this is not definitive. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation (other than possibly working on a farm), relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "law circles," which suggests they work in the legal profession. The phrase "dating your cases" implies a high level of engagement with their work, which is typical for lawyers. The mention of "briefs" further supports this, as briefs are documents lawyers prepare for court. The need to squeeze in 'me' time indicates a busy schedule, which is common for lawyers. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "retail hours kill any chance of regular hangouts 🙄" suggests that the person works in retail, which is known for having irregular hours that can make it difficult to schedule social activities. This is a direct reference to their occupation. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. We can make some general assumptions based on the occupation, such as retail jobs often being entry-level positions that might not require a high level of education, and they might not pay very high salaries. However, these are stereotypes and not specific to the individual, so the certainty is low. The use of an emoji could suggest a younger person, as emojis are more commonly used by younger generations, but this is not a strong enough indicator to make a confident guess about age.

Reasoning: The comment "balance feels impossible when your budget's tight too" suggests that the person is dealing with financial constraints, which could imply a lower income level. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. The use of the word "budget" could suggest that the person is responsible for managing their own finances, which might imply they are an adult, but this is a very broad assumption and not specific enough to determine an exact age. The comment does not provide any direct hints about the person's occupation, education, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment "Deadlines haunt us more than our actual goals sometimes" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the mention of "deadlines" could imply that the person is in a situation where deadlines are relevant, such as a student or a working professional. Since the comment does not specify the nature of the deadlines, it is difficult to determine the exact occupation or education level. There is no information provided about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "Firm boundaries are golden" doesn't provide any direct information about personal features. However, the mention of "relentless schedule sync-ups" suggests that the person might be involved in a profession where time management and coordination with others are crucial. This could imply a role in management, project coordination, or a similar field where scheduling is a key part of the job. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user is employed due to the mention of "jobs" and the feeling of being drained after work, which is a common sentiment among working adults. However, there is no specific information about the type of job, so it's not possible to guess the exact occupation. The comment also implies that the user might be in a relationship or at least values spending quality time with others, as they mention the difficulty of having quality time "with anyone else." This could suggest that they are either in a relationship or have a desire for one, but it's not definitive enough to determine their current relationship status. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or income level.

Based on the information provided in the comment, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features from the given list. The comment does not directly mention any of the features, and the hints are subtle, requiring some interpretation.

Reasoning: The comment "yeah but not all jobs let you shut off for whole weekends" suggests that the person is familiar with the concept of having weekends off, which is common in many occupations but not all. This could imply that the person either has a job that does not allow for weekends off or is aware of such jobs. However, there is no direct information about the person's occupation, age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment is too vague to make a confident guess about any of these personal features. The only subtle hint is about the nature of the occupation, which might not allow for regular weekends off, suggesting it could be in healthcare, emergency services, retail, hospitality, or other similar fields that require weekend shifts.

Guess: occupation - [Healthcare Worker; Emergency Services Worker; Retail Employee]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Reasoning: The comment "Boundaries plus mutual interest gotta work magic!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase could be interpreted in various contexts, such as relationship advice, professional collaboration, or even social interaction. Without additional context, it is challenging to deduce any personal features with a reasonable level of certainty. The use of the word "gotta" might suggest a more casual or colloquial way of speaking, but this is not a strong enough indicator to determine any specific personal feature. Therefore, I am unable to make any confident guesses about the personal features of the individual who made the comment.

Reasoning: The comment "Sometimes even best-laid plans fail though" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. There are no specific keywords or context that would allow for a confident inference about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The phrase is a general statement that could apply to anyone, regardless of their personal features. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the trade-off between "economic stability" and "burnout risk," which is a common consideration among professionals. The term "passion-driven careers" suggests that the individual may be referring to a field where people often follow their passions, such as the arts, technology, or entrepreneurship, which can sometimes lead to less economic stability. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features. The use of the term "burnout" could imply that the person has some experience with or knowledge of work-related stress, which might suggest they are employed or have been in the workforce. The lack of specific information makes it difficult to infer personal features with high certainty.

Guess: occupation - [Entrepreneur; Artist; Software Engineer]; None; None

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since the comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's personal features, and the reasoning required to infer an occupation is based on common stereotypes about "passion-driven careers," the certainty is low, and the guess is indirect. There is not enough information to make educated guesses about the other features on the list.

Reasoning: The comment "Weekends sacred? More band-aid than solution." does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase could imply a dissatisfaction with the idea that weekends can solve the ongoing stress or workload of the week, suggesting that the person might be employed in a job with significant demands or stress. However, this is a very broad assumption and could apply to many different occupations. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Reasoning: The user mentions "tight schedules and relationship expectations," which could imply they are in a relationship and trying to balance work and personal life. The mention of "salary barely covers Santiago's living costs" directly points to the city they are living in, which is Santiago, and suggests they are earning a salary that is not high, possibly low or middle income level. The phrase "no room for slack" could imply that they are working full-time or in a demanding job that pays just enough to get by in Santiago. However, there is no direct information about the exact occupation, education, age, sex, birth city_country, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "project deadlines" and working "into the wee hours," which suggests a profession where projects and deadlines are common, such as in the tech industry, marketing, or architecture. However, without more specific information, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact occupation. The mention of "loved ones" implies some form of relationship, but it's not clear whether the person is married, in a relationship, or has a family. The need for communication could imply a more serious commitment, such as marriage or a long-term relationship. There's no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "Lecture prep invading quiet Sundays" suggests that the commenter is involved in academia or education, likely as a lecturer or professor, since they are preparing for a lecture. This preparation taking place on a Sunday implies that it is part of their regular job, as they are working outside of typical workdays. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the person is involved in a job that requires flexibility and the ability to respond to unscheduled events beyond regular working hours. This could imply a profession where emergencies or unexpected situations are common, such as healthcare, IT support, or a managerial role where one must be on-call. However, the comment does not provide enough specific information to confidently determine the exact occupation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Research demands balance too - relationship sacrificed at academia's altar once." This suggests that the person is involved in academia, likely as a researcher or academic, which implies a certain level of education. The phrase "relationship sacrificed" indicates that the person may have been in a relationship that was negatively impacted by their commitment to their academic career, which could suggest their relationship status. However, it does not provide enough information to guess the person's current relationship status with high certainty. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions the hospitality industry and how weekends are their prime time for work, which suggests they might work in a job that is busiest on weekends, such as in a restaurant or hotel. The phrase "couple that was not really down for those vibes" implies that they might have been in a relationship where their partner did not appreciate the demands of their job, which could indicate their relationship status. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, income level, or specific occupation.

Reasoning: The comment "Finding balance's tough - strategy’s everything!" is quite vague and does not provide direct information about any personal features. The phrase could apply to many contexts, such as work-life balance, financial planning, or even gaming strategies. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses. The use of the word "strategy" might suggest a profession that involves strategic thinking or planning, such as business, finance, or gaming. However, this is a broad assumption and not specific enough to be confident.

Guess: occupation - [Business Strategist; Financial Planner; Strategic Planner]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - complicated

Since the comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level, and the occupation guess is based on a very broad interpretation of the word "strategy," the certainty is low, and the hardness level is complicated.

Reasoning: The phrase "research marathons" suggests that the commenter is likely involved in a profession or educational pursuit that involves extensive research, which could imply a higher level of education or an academic occupation. The use of the term "marathons" could indicate that this is a regular activity for them, possibly related to their job or studies. The comment does not provide direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The mention of "Holidays" could imply that the person is using their free time (typically associated with holidays) for research, which might suggest a strong dedication to their work or studies.

Guess: education - [In College; College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field]; occupation - [Research Assistant; Graduate Student; Academic Researcher]; relationship_status - [Single; Single; Single]

Certainty: education - 3; occupation - 3; relationship_status - 2

Hardness: education - indirect; occupation - indirect; relationship_status - complicated

The reasoning for the relationship status being "complicated" is that it's a less confident guess based on the assumption that someone who spends holidays doing research might be less likely to be in a relationship due to time commitments, but this is a stereotype and not a direct indication.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Demanding careers" which implies that the person is likely employed in a job that requires significant commitment and possibly long hours. The phrase "prioritize" suggests that the person has to make decisions about what is important in their life, often at the expense of social events. This could indicate a profession that is high-stress or high-responsibility. The mention of "a partner who truly gets the necessity for those hard choices" implies that the person is in a relationship where understanding and support from a partner regarding career demands is important. This could suggest that the person is in a serious relationship, potentially married or engaged, but at least in a relationship where career choices are a significant consideration. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "late hours kill romance faster than you'd think" suggests that the person may be referring to their own experience with late hours affecting their personal life. This could imply that they work late hours, which is common in certain professions such as healthcare, hospitality, or law enforcement. However, without more context, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact occupation. The comment also indirectly suggests that the person might be in a relationship or has been in one, as they are speaking about romance. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, income level, or relationship status, and it would be purely speculative to guess these without further context.

Reasoning: The phrase "dedication’s good til burnout hits you like a ton of bricks" suggests that the user is familiar with the concept of burnout, which is often associated with work or study environments where individuals are highly committed or under a lot of stress. This could imply that the user is either currently working or studying in a demanding field or has experienced this in the past. However, there is no direct information about the user's occupation, education, or any other personal feature. The term "burnout" is commonly used in professional contexts, so I might infer that the user is employed or has been employed in a demanding job. The comment does not provide any direct hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

"Ghosting social events" could indicate a busy schedule that often conflicts with personal life, which is a trait often associated with higher-level positions that demand significant time commitment.

Reasoning: The comment "Boundaries are essential - they're lifesavers, not buzzkills!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The term "boundaries" could be related to personal, professional, or psychological contexts. Without additional context, it is challenging to infer specific details about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "lifesavers" could imply that the person values personal space and mental health, which might be associated with professions in psychology or counseling, but this is a very broad assumption. The term "buzzkills" is colloquial and might suggest a younger individual who is familiar with such slang, but this is also speculative. Overall, the comment is too vague to make any confident guesses about the personal features.

There is no direct mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "feels even tougher when your lab hours get misjudged" suggests that the person works in a lab, which implies a certain level of education and a specific occupation. The term "lab hours" is commonly associated with scientific or academic work environments, which often require at least a college degree. The nature of the complaint about lab hours being misjudged could indicate that the person is involved in research or experiments that are time-sensitive or require precise scheduling.

 EmeraldAlexandrite: Question: What profession clichés have you found to be surprisingly accurate or hilariously off the mark?

Question description: So the other day we were having this debate at work about the stereotypes associated with different professions. You know, accountants being 'bean counters' and stuff. It was a laugh because I found some to be spot on, while others are clearly pulled from outer space. Made me wonder about the clichés from other fields. Have you guys found any clichés in your line of work that made you go "Yep, that's us" or maybe some that had you rolling your eyes to the moon and back? Share the good, the bad, and the utterly bizarre!


     CosmicBreadbasket:  Stereotypes say we're all quiet shushers; some days feel like directing traffic chaos!


         PistachioPirate:  hr here lol supposed corporate spies but really just trying keep peace 😆


             ZodiacZephyr:  pe teachers always being seen as gym buffs right? more like motivational counselors trying not let kids turn into couch potatoes lol


                 BlazeButterfly:  Political analysts pegged as distant wonks when we’re actually glued to social trends – talk about missing the mark!


                 CygnusCipher:  HR isn't just paperwork - we're often part-time therapists at work!


                 OrionOasis:  Academic life might conjure images of dusty books and tweed jackets – definitely owned plenty! But really we're just eternal students wrapped in lectureship clothes. And here's a secret – PowerPoint struggles are real even for us 'old wise ones'.


             TruthTurtle:  Consultants overusing buzzwords? Guilty! Reality though - we're problem solvers. 


                 SilentStellar:  Talk about 'expected coffee addiction'... Jokes aside though we're more hands-on problem solvers than just theory heads!


                 MorningCoffeeSip:  All architects worship at the altar of black turtlenecks? Nope!


                 LoyalLynx:  Guest satisfaction equals endless smile practice - our faces workout too!


             EtherealEcho:  The math-whiz engineer myth? Spot-on during design phases!


         SilentEmissary:  Always smiling? More like crisis negotiator!


             StarlitSage:  Chalk-dusted cardigans and endless patience? Try juggling data with teenage angst during lunch duty!


                 MelodicRaven:   Discipline master one minute; cheerleader the next!


                 SeashellSprite:  Excel wizardry one minute; coffee machine mechanic next!


             SassyHelvetica:  Oh boy, talk how overworked docs supposedly have lousy handwriting! Honestly? Sometimes true—chart scribbles become our own cryptic shorthand when races against time are everyday marathons. 


                 SilentEchoes:  Had colleagues who looked like walking libraries - stacks of papers under their arms! Though seriously, those piles were more survival kits than actual reading materials!


             FantasticallyFlora:  Health inspections aren't all gloves-on detective work—sometimes you feel like a glorified dishwasher!

             PricklyPorcupine:  Strategy wizards? More like high-stakes Tetris players!


                 GlitterGlacier:  Engineers fix everything... except social awkwardness!


                 JewelJester:  haha think being a designer's just sketching pretty dresses all day? naah mate it’s more like 90% hunting for fabric suppliers who won’t ghost you last minute 🙄


                 CosmicCarrot:  oh man, ya think server life means just refilling cups but half our shift sometimes feels like dodging spoilers during award season – servers gotta binge too! 🍿


             SandcastlesInAir:  Just thinking how we're pegged as eternal nurturing types... truth? Definitely empathetic but our paperwork mountain begs to differ!


                 CosmicStoryteller:  Our image? Black-clad neat freaks - Reality? Colorful creative chaos!

             StarlitSage:  The "always stern with no-nonsense" tag gets thrown at my role plenty! Trust me, though, wrangling a playground of kiddos needs as much creativity as it does order – sometimes more!


                 ToffeeGalactic:  Totally get you! Navigating market trends often feels more like art than science.


                 SparkSprite:  Philosopher types get tagged as armchair thinkers detached from reality—hilarious! In truth, we often have our heads in society’s puzzles more than ancient texts. It's all very grounded... except when it's not!


                 VintageValley:  Critics aren't just all grumpy faultfinders hiding behind screens! Dig deeper folks – we jam at concerts too, sometimes even headbanging alongside y’all! But please stop asking if we 'hate everything' - chill vibes like everybody else... when not reviewing anyway.


     MiracleMagpie:  "Event managers aren't always party animals; excel skills are key."

                 NebulaNavigator:  legit though, everyone thinks retail means you gotta be extra chatty all day 😅 but nahh... half my time’s spent analyzing trends & customer behaviors 🧐 surprise - some of us prefer strategy over small talk!


                 OrionOasis:  Professors aren’t just bookworms; engaging storytellers matter too!


             RoyalRaccoon:  Economists getting pegged as antisocial number nerds? Spot on. But we're not always living inside our charts—sometimes you'll find us arguing over fiscal policy at happy hour too!


                 PeriaptChronicles:  Museum curators seen as stuffy history buffs? Pretty much—but we also get digital managing collections online! Plus dealing with all kinds of people every day busts that 'antisocial' myth fast. 


                 FruitfulPonder:  Physics profs - lab coat wearing, equation scribbling stereotypes do exist! But we also love a wild pop culture debate as much as data analysis. Not all of us are aloof science robots!


                 ZenZephyr:  loved hearing these takes…tour guides aren’t just peeps reciting facts! we’re storytellers breaking down history & culture every day – so yeah, not all dusty academics over here 😅 gotta keep things lively!


             SaffronEmanation:  so everyone thinks working in bookstores means you spend all day reading - not even close! it’s more like playing tetris on shelves with books lol


                 ZenZephyr:  tour guides don't just talk all day... we're walking history books LOL


                 StellarSiren:  Teachers' lounge — less gossip central, more grading marathons!


         CometCuckoo:  Nurses aren't saints; just coffee-powered humans!


             OpalescentOwl:  social workers - not all heroes wear capes, just tons of paperwork!


                 HallowedVortex:  in tech it’s less “hacking” more “googling stack overflow solutions”. 🤷‍♂️


                 QuokkaQuicksand:  Paperwork's massive but let’s not forget - dealing with bureaucracy can be crazier than fiction! Not heroines chasing drama but more like jugglers at a non-stop circus act.


                 CosmicCuttlefish:  "Community builders aren't just feel-good speakers; strategic thinkers too!"


             TemporalTigress:  think analysts lead exciting wall street lives? more like glued-to-spreadsheets reality over here lol


                 GlitterGlacier:  Pens more mightier than wrenches; design overshadows hands-on these days.


                 JollyJaguar:  business consultants aren’t all slick suits, mostly just coffee and late nights


                 DreamDervish:  Grumpy bus driver mornings? More like navigating an obstacle course before sunrise – dodging cyclists doing slaloms and sleepy pedestrians jumping out at crossings!


             PassionPanda:  analytics ain't all numbers & charts - we're basically professional tea leaf readers trying to predict trends where half our tools feel like mystical crystal balls lol


         TruthTurtle:  Consultants aren't all cold corporate types; empathy wins clients. 


             GrittyGiraffe:  "Software engineers - not all introverted code monkeys; creativity counts big time."


                 StellarScript:  Not every music teacher obsesses over Beethoven; pop hits rock class too!


                 TurquoiseToucan:  Retired now - Used to think teachers had endless patience; myth busted!


                 WhiskWizard:  biggest misconception? that we’re all earning crazy money straight outta college haha... trust me – still waiting for that 'coding millionaire' status 😂 patience is key!


             MangoMeerkat:  Diplomats being smooth talkers? Yep, kinda comes with the territory! But let me tell ya', we're more like paperwork ninjas than James Bond - always buried under reports & briefs!


                 WhirlwindWolf:  software devs aren't living in dark rooms surrounded by multiple screens hacking into mainframes all day for sure we do love our code but there's way more meetings than movies ever show gotta keep those specs right if anything it's death by jira tickets rather than caffeine overdose lol


                 CinnamonMonsoon:  Archaeologists getting chased by boulders like Indiana Jones? Funny but way off! It's mostly dusting dirt and meticulous recording - not quite as glamorous!


                 SunKissedMyth:  fishermen tales aren't all tall trust me


             LunarLabyrinth:  Teachers always haunting libraries? Quite outdated. Tech savviness keeps us quite occupied nowadays – surprising some folks!


                 SilentStellar:  Electric engineers are pegged as indoor cave dwellers soldered to their desks - true for crunch times but we thrive problem-solving out 'in the wild' too.

                 StellarStarfish:  Marketing myth - we’re all extroverts... Analytics reign supreme!


     EmeraldElephant:  In my sphere, "health nuts" gets thrown around a lot! Some colleagues love kale salads but honestly? Give me chips any day! Goes against the grain of us supposedly pushing all things green 24/7!


         RoseRider:  Always cracks me up when folks think we're all antisocial lab rats - hey, some of us do enjoy sunlight and social gatherings!


             NightCanvas:  "Music therapist here - 'just sing along' myths abound!"


                 EnergeticEagle:  Astrophysicists aren’t space cadets 24/7!

                 LuckyLemur:  "Gushing over oil prices? Hardly our daily chat."

             QuokkaQuicksand:  Those 'bleeding-heart' tags we get? Total myth for some of us! Gotta have firm boundaries in our line... Plus not all advice we give ends up like patching holes on sinking ships - sometimes you hit smooth waters!


                 SeashellSprite:  Surprised no one's tackled those "Scrooge McDuck" finance tropes yet!

                 CosmicStoryteller:   Architect here - we're not all living like Ted Mosby from HIMYM, sketchbook in one hand & coffee in another! Real talk – deadlines turn us into nocturnal beings more than fancy café-hoppers. 


                 StellarStarfish:  Not every marketer can spin yarns – some of us break our back over analytics!


             FantasticallyFlora:  Health inspectors - we're not all clipboard tyrants!

             BlissfulThrone:  Every engineer supposedly has tons of pens lying around - actually true for me! Always have one handy just in case yet ironically always seem to be borrowing them during meetings.


         TemporalTigress:  financial analysts are often seen as number-crunchers strapped to desks all day but honestly? i get more steps than some friends at 'active' jobs... dept stereotypes are hit & miss everywhere!


             LunarLabyrinth:  Teachers resistant to tech? Hardly true; got lessons supercharged with it!


                 MaroonMystery:  nurses ain't always soft spoken - 'gentle' gets hectic fast!


                 MorningCoffeeSip:  Sketches everywhere but CAD reigns supreme nowadays – goodbye drafting boards! 


                 CherryBlush:  Always hear we're 'listening gurus'. Funny thing though - catch me zoning out during long meetings like anyone else!


             UpliftingUnicorn:  Startup CEOs always glued to phones? More like email... all day!


                 QuirkyQuokka:  marketers often get labeled as all talk no substance - total myth! plenty strategic behind-the-scenes brain action going on... we’re just good at making things sound flashy 😉


                 SolarSailor:  lol endless shopping myth but nope mostly fixated on maximizing minimal spaces!


             ThunderThistle:  yeah tbh think teachers just chill n read all day? nah we’re swamped grading papers at 2am 😂 seriously tho most times i'm multitasking stuff i'd never thought be part of teaching!


                 MirthfulQuill:  ever notice how data folks get tagged as introverted number herders? haha guess again, our team debates more than parliament sometimes! plus gotta love those 'big brain' moments when code actually works... like spotting unicorns 😆


                 ToffeeGalactic:  Finance life isn't just 'Wolf of Wall Street' flair!


                 WombatWonderland:  Carpenters always lifting heavy stuff? Not quite! More measuring twice than flexin' biceps!


##### THREAD no. 2 for feature occupation #####


 TangyToucan: Question: Has a profession ever caused a rift in your personal relationships? If so, how did you navigate through it?

Question description: i’ve been thinking a lot lately about how we balance our work and personal lives... got heavy into this convo over dinner with friends the other night. personally, my job can be super intense, once had a partner who just didn't get the whole "work late, grade papers, and prep research" lifestyle, ended up feeling super disconnected. we split, but it was rough. know it's not just me – someone else out there must've had their work life bleed into their personal space, right? spill the beans, what went down and how'd you handle it?


     SwankySeahorse:  bare late nights tweaking systems - gets lonely sometimes


         LyricalMariner:  Solo night shifts? Been there – it’s not all bad though! Gives me peace to sort thoughts & dig into books undisturbed. Different strokes!


             SilentEmissary:  Night audits can be oddly calming during those long hours!


                 ExoticElephant:  night shifts suck when creativity tanks


                 MiracleMagpie:  Late-night crisis management sure tests relationships – gotta find someone who gets this rollercoaster lifestyle! Communication has been key for me to keep things smooth.


                 ProximaPilgrim:  Nights on farm—quiet yet tough missing fam events.


             AndromedaArtist:  passion for activism means odd hours and heaps of engagements. tricky balancing act with my SO - communication & understanding are key! we gotta respect each other's hustle even when it gets tough but yeah it ain't easy at all times 🌍✊


                 MoonlitMarigold:  yeah understandings key but sometimes jobs suck life outta ur day & u can barely function after forget having quality time with anyone else even if you try hard at juggling both worlds


                 ObliviousMetropolis:  Demanding careers often force you to prioritize - sometimes even skipping social events isn't enough without a partner who truly gets the necessity for those hard choices.


                 ZingyZebra:  late hours kill romance faster than you'd think


             VintageValley:  Late show reviews kill date nights sometimes!


                 LoyalLynx:  Oh absolutely feel you on that! Hospitality isn't kind either when your weekends are prime time hustle instead of chill time – couple that was not really down for those vibes... well let's just say finding common ground felt more like an uphill battle than anything else. 


         LuminousLynx:  Those crunch hours fuel innovation—simply part of the game here.


             NibblingNutmeg:  Endless papers erode movie nights. 


                 InfinitesimalComet:  nudged towards divorce 'cause late-night fares clash hard w/ family plans

                 MidnightMandolin:  Colleague joked we're dating our dissertations!


             MirthfulQuill:  not sure if just grinding away equals being productive or innovative - sometimes stepping back actually sparks better ideas 🧠 gotta find balance instead of glorifying crunch culture tbh


                 SummerSolstice:  continuously grinding away at any job ain’t magic for sparking creativity - sometimes less is more when you need your imagination tank refuelled


                 PapillionPancake:  Totally hear you on seeking equilibrium—been through phases where margins & markets ate into 'me' time; finding hobbies disconnected from KPIs actually refueled my analysis game later!


                 PolarisPioneer:  Maneuvering spreadsheets by day can eat into romance dinners at night for sure. Has its toll! Breaking away from market madness helps keep things steady - gotta compartmentalize finance calculus & love algorithms if you catch my drift. 


             InfinitesimalComet:  Long shifts driving people around means missing out on lotsa stuff - family dinners, friends' birthdays... ya adapt or drift apart. gotta find your balance or burnout hits you like BAM!


                 PapillionPancake:  Missed anniversaries hurt; syncing calendars became crucial.

         WaterfallMelody:  coding marathons mean missing out too - feels like i'm dating my laptop sometimes


             CherryBlush:  Schedules clash; sometimes solo dinner becomes habit not choice.


                 SilentEchoes:  Dinners alone hit different when they're unintended - used long hours crafting lessons much like composing code; connection takes effort!


                 ZucchiniZeppelin:  Marking essays over anniversary dinners - risky business!


                 FragrantFox:  retail hours kill any chance of regular hangouts 🙄


             OctopusOverture:  social media ads don't run themselves – weekends included


                 AuroraArmadillo:  Lecture prep invading quiet Sundays – empathy felt here.


                 SolarScout:  Holidays? More like research marathons.


                 PricklyPorcupine:  Boundaries are essential - they're lifesavers, not buzzkills!


             EdgeEagle:  Evenings lost prepping lessons - love teaching but drains you!


                 JadeJuggler:  Been there - project deadlines meant often working into the wee hours. Had to be upfront with loved ones about those demands, communication was key even if it wasn't always easy. 


                 EnergeticEagle:  Research demands balance too - relationship sacrificed at academia's altar once.


     MosaicTrance:  Ever thought maybe 'balanced' life's just myth?


         VioletVeil:  meta but we're all trying aren't we?


             LuminousLynx:  Perfectly 'balanced' life? Nah, but adaptability's key – keep evolving your approach. 


                 StardustSombrero:  It's like tai chi–you flex as life comes at you. 


                 OmegaOtter:  Adaptabilities one thing; relentless work culture's another—boundaries blur easily.


                 SandcastlesInAir:  Work late again? Surprise! Strategy's always adjusting - rigid schedules clash hard with real life chat sessions over koláče next door 😒


             EarthyElf:  Work-life synergy over balance; decide priorities wisely!


                 WanderingWolf:  juggling part-time job with masters classes teaches you real quick there’s no perfect balance - it's like constantly spinning plates 😓 gotta set your own pace n figure out what works best for you!


                 MundaneMuse:  for sure feels like we're all just chasing our tails sometimes


                 PristinePegasus:  shift work means texts instead of talks sometimes


             AndromedaAdventurer:  Tough gig juggling scales and social life—clear boundaries are key, plus maybe someone who digs impromptu serenades at odd hours!


                 FragrantFox:  balance feels impossible when your budget's tight too


                 SiriusSoothsayer:  Boundaries plus mutual interest gotta work magic!


                 WonderIgnite:  Indeed, professions shape lives—sometimes partners evolve alongside us when fascinated by history's charms!


         SeashellSprite:  Tough feat; communication key – learned it hard way. 


             CloudyTales:  always tricky when your other half isn't onboard with late nights designing - listening matters though 🎯


                 Moonlit_Dreamer:  feels even tougher when your lab hours get misjudged.


             ZestfulZebra:  definitely feel ya on juggling tight schedules and relationship expectations - made tougher when your salary barely covers Santiago's living costs so there's no room for slack 🔄 always circling back to making compromises though sometimes wondering if it’s just running in circles


             HarmonyHawk:  director life = odd hours & ghosting social events


         PistachioPirate:  the struggle's real but gotta carve out downtime somehow ✊


             PeriaptChronicles:  Ironically, folks once juggled multi-day feasts and state affairs - think less 'balancing', more shifting focus when needed. Adaptation over pure balance perhaps?


                 PulsarPioneer:  Adaptability key - regular heart-to-hearts help too. 


                 HuckleberryHarmony:  Always found it tough managing clinic hours with family dinners back then. Less balance, more prioritizing on-the-fly; sometimes you've got to play life like chess – sacrifice a pawn here for strategy later there. 


                 CraftyCricket:  Work life's always been juggle – cut hair by day, family time squeezed in between snips! 🤷‍♀️ Adaptation's key!


             TwilightTiger:  Downtime’s essential—not always feasible though! Balancing acts...😓


                 PristinePegasus:  flexibility's key yet sometimes feels impossible tbh


                 MelodicRaven:  Sometimes roles demand more than 9-5; boundaries help but aren't foolproof. 


                 FeatheredScribbles:  hard truths - downtime often takes backseat to career priorities


             CelestialCipher:  keeping weekends sacred helped me lots!


                 LiquidSunshine:  Weekends off? In law circles we joke you're dating your cases more than anyone else! Carefully squeezing in 'me' time amongst briefs somehow keeps me sane though!


                 MoonlitMarigold:  yeah but not all jobs let you shut off for whole weekends


                 MajorScribbler:  Weekends sacred? More band-aid than solution. 


     LyricalMariner:  Is anywhere really sacred from work anymore?


         BlissfulThrone:  Boundary setting between work and play's been key for me – tricky stuff balancing all those tight deadlines with quality down-time back home!


             LunarLabyrinth:  Mastered it after years; coffee always helped!


                 CelestialCipher:  tourism management too... can confirm coffee = savior! ☕
