Reasoning: The comment "Sorry but old trinkets don't prove ghosts" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the user. The skepticism towards the existence of ghosts or the proof thereof could be indicative of a rational or scientific mindset, but this is a very broad assumption and does not necessarily correlate with any specific education level, occupation, or other personal features. The use of the word "trinkets" could imply some familiarity with collectibles or antiques, but this is a tenuous link at best. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features listed.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "historical finds" which could suggest an interest or background in history, archaeology, or a related field. The use of the term "=/=" is internet slang for "not equal to," which might indicate a younger individual who is familiar with online communication styles. The phrase "but don't downplay their worth tho" suggests a defense of the value of historical finds, which could further point to a personal or professional interest in the subject. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of internet slang might weakly suggest a younger age, but this is not a strong indicator. The comment does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about any of the listed features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Based on the information provided in the comment, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the given list. The comment is too vague and lacks specific details that would allow for such inferences.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "Basement artifacts" which could imply that the user is interested in or knowledgeable about real estate, but this is not a direct indication of their occupation. The term "undervalued real estate goldmine" suggests that the user may have some insight into real estate investment or property valuation, but again, this is speculative and not definitive. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about these personal features.

Reasoning: The comment expresses skepticism towards the authenticity of 'artifacts' and suggests a preference for evidence before believing in the 'real history'. This could imply a critical thinking mindset often associated with higher education or a profession that requires analytical skills, such as a historian, archaeologist, or an academic. However, there is no direct mention of the commenter's occupation, education, or any other personal feature. The use of the term 'sensationalism' might suggest familiarity with media critique or academic discourse, but this is a weak inference. Without more context, it is difficult to make accurate guesses about the personal features of the commenter.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the topic of urban myths and hauntings, which suggests an interest in history or possibly a profession related to history, such as an archaeologist, historian, or urban planner. The phrase "unearthing history" could imply a profession that involves digging or researching the past, but this is not a direct indication. The comment does not provide any direct information about personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The interest in urban myths and history could be associated with a higher education level, possibly in the humanities, but this is speculative.

Reasoning: The comment "every legend has roots, ever heard vaccine myths?" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The mention of "vaccine myths" could suggest that the user is interested in or has knowledge about vaccines, which could be related to education or occupation, but this is a very weak inference. There is no mention of age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, relationship status, or income level. The phrase "every legend has roots" is too vague to draw any conclusions from. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features listed.

Reasoning: The comment "Cultural heritage beats property investment every time" suggests a preference for cultural values over financial gain. This could imply a few things about the person's occupation, education, or even city_country, but these are not directly stated and require some assumptions. Someone who values cultural heritage might be involved in a profession related to history, arts, or education. They might also have a higher education level, as appreciation for cultural heritage often increases with education. However, these are broad assumptions and not specific to the comment. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context, it's challenging to make accurate guesses about these personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Neat findings ≠ haunted lore validation" suggests that the user is discussing a topic related to either scientific findings or myth debunking. The use of "≠" (not equal to) indicates a logical or analytical approach to the subject, which might suggest a higher education level or an occupation related to research, science, or skepticism. However, there are no direct references to personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of the term "haunted lore" could imply an interest in folklore or the supernatural, but this is not sufficient to make a confident guess about any personal features. The comment is quite generic and does not provide enough context or detail to infer personal features with a high degree of certainty.

Since the comment does not provide direct or indirect information about personal features, the guesses are based on very general assumptions and are therefore not highly certain. The reasoning required to make these guesses is complicated due to the lack of context and specific information.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the difference between vaccine misinformation and local lore, suggesting a concern for public health and possibly a background in healthcare or science. The mention of "office stapler" implies the commenter works in an office environment, which could be related to many professions, but combined with the concern for misinformation, it might suggest a profession in healthcare administration, education, or science communication. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

The use of the term "haunt vibes" suggests a disinterest in the supernatural aspect of history, possibly indicating a more scientific or academic approach to historical artifacts. However, this is quite speculative and does not provide a strong basis for guessing any personal features with high certainty. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Artifacts might be indicators of history, not hauntings." suggests that the user is discussing a topic related to history or the supernatural. The use of the term "artifacts" could imply a background in history, archaeology, or a related field. However, the statement is quite general and does not provide specific information about the user's personal features. There is no direct mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment could be made by anyone with a general interest in history or skepticism about the supernatural, making it difficult to infer any personal features with confidence.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the listed personal features, there are no guesses, certainties, or hardness levels to provide.
Reasoning: The comment does not provide direct information about any personal features. The skepticism towards ghost stories could suggest a rational or scientific mindset, which might be associated with certain educational backgrounds or occupations. However, this is a very broad assumption and could apply to a wide range of people. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The comment is too vague to make any confident guesses about personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The comment contains a rhyme and a playful tone, which might suggest a younger individual, but this is not a strong indicator of age. The use of "urban legend fascination" and "vaccinate" does not provide any direct information about personal features. The term "urban legend" could imply an interest in stories or myths, which is common across various demographics and does not narrow down any personal feature. The mention of "vaccinate" could suggest an interest in health or science, but this is also a broad topic that many people of different backgrounds discuss, especially in the context of recent global events. There is no direct or indirect information that allows us to confidently guess any of the features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

None
Reasoning: The commenter expresses a need for data compilation and analysis, as well as the use of reliable sensors, which suggests a scientific or analytical mindset. This could imply a background in a field that requires such skills, such as engineering, data science, or research. The skepticism towards the existence of ghosts indicates a rational and possibly scientific approach to phenomena, which might be associated with higher education in a scientific field. There is no direct mention of personal features, so the reasoning is based on the language used and the approach to the topic.

The use of the phrase "equating these discoveries with ghosts stretches reality considerably" could imply a rational, possibly academic approach to historical interpretation, which might suggest a higher education level.

Reasoning: The comment does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the user. The phrase "legends usually hint at some truth" could suggest an interest in history, mythology, or folklore, but this is a very broad assumption and does not directly correlate with any specific personal feature.

##### THREAD no. 1 for feature city_country #####


 EmeraldAlexandrite: Question: What’s the strangest “local legend” or urban myth in your area that turned out to be true or had some truth to it?

Question description: I grew up hearing stories about a supposedly "haunted" building in the heart of the city. Everyone would say it's just old wives' tales until a few years back, a renovation project actually dug up some pretty eerie stuff from its basement – I'm talking real historical artifacts that were better suited for a museum than an office block. From that point, those tales didn't seem so laughable. Got me thinking about the gems hidden in plain sight and the truth behind urban myths. What bizarre stories from your area eventually ended up having a hint of truth in them?


     CosmopolitanArcade:  Sorry but old trinkets don't prove ghosts.


         WaterWizard:  historical finds =/= ghosts but don't downplay their worth tho


             CosmopolitanArcade:  Neat findings ≠ haunted lore validation


                 WaterWizard:  cool finds actually give real context to our past👀 just not ghost stuff - still super fascinating minus haunt vibes!


             JellyfishBlitz:  stuff found raises questions though


         RustyGalaxy:  Those finds might not confirm hauntings but let’s not dismiss how they can fuel some solid lore! Unearthing history often gives more layers to these urban myths - makes you wonder what else we're walking over every day without knowing...


             JellyfishBlitz:  sure we find stuff from the past underground but doesn't mean there’s some spooky tale attached - could be just someone's old junk forgotten down there


                 WalrusWhisper:  Finding old stuff doesn't automatically make ghost stories legit – need solid proof!


                     RustyGalaxy:  Cool find? Yes. Proof ghosts are real? Hardly! We'd need data we can compile and analyze before making those leaps – plus reliable sensors would've noticed something by now!


         ZephyrZebra:  Artifacts might be indicators of history, not hauntings. 


             BopsieBunny:  Historical finds give credence only to past events – equating these discoveries with ghosts stretches reality considerably. Legends thrive on ambiguity after all. 


     ZephyrZebra:  Basement artifacts? Sounds like undervalued real estate goldmine. 


         BopsieBunny:  "Cultural heritage beats property investment every time."


     WalrusWhisper:  Not buying it without seeing these supposed 'artifacts'. Sounds more like sensationalism than real history...


     NobleNightingale:  every legend has roots, ever heard vaccine myths?


         TangyZephyr:   Not sure if we should lump all 'myths' together. Vaccine misinformation can cause real harm unlike quirky local lore which might unearth some history buried beneath your office stapler!


             WalrusWhisper:  Urban legend fascination – kinda natural; vaccinate – just factual!


             JellyfishBlitz:  legends usually hint at some truth - makes you wonder what gets overlooked because it seems too fantastical right?

Reasoning: The comment "Compromise matters but don't lose yourself" is a general piece of advice that could be given by anyone, regardless of their personal features. There are no direct references to age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The advice could potentially be related to relationship status, as compromise is often a topic in relationships, but this is a very weak inference.

Reasoning: The comment "Solid point! Maybe also underrated—clear boundaries & saying 'no' sometimes?" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The content of the comment is quite generic and could apply to anyone regardless of their age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The mention of "clear boundaries & saying 'no'" could potentially hint at a professional setting where such skills are valued, but this is a very broad assumption and could apply to many different occupations.

Reasoning: The comment provided does not give any direct information about the person's personal features. The phrase "Compromising has its limits – too much equals losing yourself anyway! Balance is key 🔑" is a general statement that could be made by anyone, regardless of their age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. There are no specific cultural references, slang, or jargon that could hint at a particular demographic or professional background. The use of the key emoji 🔑 could suggest that the person values solutions or has an interest in self-help or philosophy, but this is a very broad interpretation and does not lead to a confident guess about any personal features.

Since the comment does not provide any substantial hints or information that could lead to an educated guess about the person's personal features, I am unable to make any guesses. The comment is too vague and general to infer any personal details.
Reasoning: The comment does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the use of the phrase "us vs. me" could suggest that the person is reflecting on relationship dynamics, which might imply they have some experience in relationships. This could be a subtle hint that the person is not single. The advice to "keep it real" and not overthink could be interpreted as coming from someone who has gone through the early stages of relationships before and learned from them, possibly indicating a more mature age, but this is a very weak inference. There is no information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The comment is quite generic and could apply to many people, making it difficult to infer specific personal features.

The phrase "recipe for loneliness" could imply that the person might be speaking from personal experience, which could suggest a relationship status, but this is a very weak inference. The mention of "moderation" could imply a philosophical or balanced approach to life, but this is also a stretch and does not directly relate to any of the personal features. Without any additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "budget talks" and "money misunderstandings," which could imply that the person is involved in managing finances, either personally or professionally. However, this is not a direct indication of their occupation, as many individuals could discuss budget regardless of their job. The term "joy killers" suggests a level of familiarity with the topic that could come from personal experience, possibly hinting at a relationship status where finances are a shared concern, such as being married or in a relationship. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or income level.

However, there are no direct references to age or education.

Reasoning: The comment "wish i'd known no fairy tales here; real effort required" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The phrase "no fairy tales here" could imply a realization or a lesson learned, which might suggest that the person has gone through an experience that changed their perspective, possibly related to work or education. However, this is highly speculative and does not provide a solid basis for a confident guess. The phrase "real effort required" could imply that the person is engaged in a task or field that is challenging, but again, this is not specific enough to determine occupation or education. There are no direct references to age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The comment is vague and does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about any of the features.

None
Reasoning: The comment "Balance alone isn't enough; clear communication rules supreme" does not provide any direct information about personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The phrase could be interpreted in various contexts, such as work-life balance, physical balance, or even financial balance. However, the emphasis on "clear communication" might suggest a professional setting where communication is key, such as management, human resources, or counseling. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features of the commenter.

Guess: occupation - [Human Resources Manager; Communications Specialist; Counselor]

Certainty: occupation - 1

Hardness: occupation - complicated

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information about the other features, I cannot make any guesses for them. Therefore, the only feature I can attempt to guess is the occupation, and even that is highly speculative and uncertain.

Reasoning: The comment "romance takes work, just like wine-making" suggests that the user is drawing a parallel between romance and the process of making wine. This could imply that the user has some knowledge or experience with wine-making, which might be part of their occupation. However, this is not a direct indication and could also be a metaphor used by someone who appreciates wine or has read about it. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [Winemaker; Vineyard Manager; Wine Industry Professional]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

None

Acc for feature  occupation : 0.0
Reasoning: The comment provided does not contain any direct information about the person's personal features. The phrase "Absolutely! But where's that line? Tougher than expected, right?" is very generic and could be applied to a multitude of scenarios. There are no specific cultural references, slang, or other indicators that would allow for a confident guess about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features listed.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any clues or context that could lead to an educated guess about the personal features, there are no guesses or certainty levels to provide, and thus no hardness levels to assign.
Reasoning: The comment discusses the importance of maintaining individual goals within a relationship, which suggests a level of maturity and experience in relationships. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status. The use of the phrase "lovey-dovey vibes" could imply some familiarity with casual or colloquial English expressions, possibly hinting at a younger age or a certain cultural background, but this is speculative. The focus on personal growth and relationship dynamics might suggest that the commenter values personal development, which could be associated with higher education, but again, this is not directly indicated. Without more context or specific information, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features of the commenter.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide direct or indirect information that would allow for confident guessing of any of the listed features, I am unable to make any guesses.
Reasoning: The comment discusses relationships and compromise with an analogy to scientific reactions, which suggests a familiarity with scientific concepts. This could imply an education in a scientific field. However, the comment does not provide direct evidence of the commenter's occupation, education, or any other personal feature. The use of the word "passion" might hint at a belief in the importance of emotions in relationships, which could suggest the commenter has experience with relationships, but this is a very weak inference. The analogy to elements reacting could imply a background in chemistry, but this is speculative. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: education - [Bachelor's degree in Chemistry; Master's Degree in Chemistry; PhD in Chemistry]; occupation - [Chemist; Research Scientist; Science Teacher]; relationship_status - [In Relationship; Married; Divorced]

Certainty: education - 2; occupation - 1; relationship_status - 1

Hardness: education - complicated; occupation - complicated; relationship_status - complicated

The guesses are based on very weak inferences and there is a high level of uncertainty. The comment does not provide enough information to make confident guesses about the personal features of the commenter.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "crucial career alignment talks," which suggests that the person is likely to be in a stage of life where career is a significant focus. This could imply that the person is of working age and possibly has some level of higher education, as career alignment talks often involve discussions about professional development and job satisfaction, which are more common among individuals who have pursued education beyond high school. However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "romanticizing" could imply that the person is reflecting on relationship dynamics in the context of career, but this is a weak inference for relationship status.

Guess: education - [In College; College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field]; None; None

Certainty: education - 2

Hardness: education - indirect

Since the comment does not provide direct or easily deducible information about the other features, I am unable to make guesses for them with any reasonable level of certainty.

Reasoning: The comment does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The use of the phrase "overly moderate" and "stand strong" could imply a personality trait or a philosophical stance rather than a demographic feature. There is no mention of age, sex, city or country, birth city or country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment seems to be a general statement about behavior or attitude, which makes it difficult to infer any personal features with confidence. Without additional context or information, any guess would be purely speculative and based on stereotypes or biases, which is not reliable.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The comment "Effort yes, but effective communication? Crucial." does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The emphasis on effective communication could suggest a profession where communication is key, such as a manager, a teacher, or a communications specialist. However, this is a very broad assumption and could apply to many professions. There is no mention or hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about these features.

Guess: occupation - [Communications Specialist; Manager; Teacher]

Certainty: occupation - 1

Hardness: occupation - complicated

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information about the other features, and the guess about the occupation is based on a very broad assumption with low certainty, no other features can be guessed.

Reasoning: The comment "happily-ever-after's overrated anyways – just causes grief" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The phrase could suggest a cynical or disillusioned attitude towards romantic relationships, which might imply that the person has experienced a relationship that did not work out as expected. This could potentially indicate a relationship status, but it is a very weak inference. There is no information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The comment is too vague to make any confident guesses about these features.

Guess: relationship_status - [Divorced; Single; Widowed]

Certainty: relationship_status - 1

Hardness: relationship_status - complicated

None

Saving guess:  [{'feature': 'relationship_status', 'guesses': ['Divorced', 'Single', 'Widowed'], 'hardness': 'complicated', 'certainty': 1, 'model_eval': [0, 0, 1]}]
Reasoning: The comment mentions "health issues" and "roadblocks," which could imply that the person has personal experience with health-related challenges. However, this is not enough information to confidently determine any specific personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The term "roadblocks" could suggest challenges in life or career, but it is too vague to draw any concrete conclusions. There is no direct or indirect information provided that would allow for a confident guess on any of the listed features.

##### THREAD no. 1 for feature relationship_status #####


 TangyToucan: Question: What's something you wish you knew about relationships when you were younger?

Question description: It's funny how hindsight is 20/20, isn't it? I once thought my happily-ever-after was a given, but turns out, it's a bit more complicated 😆. Looking back, there's a heap I'd tell my younger self, especially about maintaining individuality while sharing a life with someone. It's like, you need to have your own hobbies, friends, and time apart to keep things fresh, you know? What insights would you go back and give to your younger self about relationships?


     CosmopolitanArcade:  Compromise matters but don't lose yourself. 


         TangyZephyr:  Compromising has its limits – too much equals losing yourself anyway! Balance is key 🔑


             ZephyrZebra:  Too little though? Recipe for loneliness - moderation is everything!


                 BopsieBunny:  Balance alone isn't enough; clear communication rules supreme. 


                 WalrusWhisper:  Oddly enough, treating compromise like a formula can backfire – relationships aren't only science! Too measured can mean wasted opportunities for growth or even passion's slow death. Ever seen two elements react mildly? Sometimes it’s underwhelming; not every interaction should be tepid. 


                 RustyGalaxy:   Ever consider being overly moderate can just leave you stagnant? There's gotta be some fire – stand strong sometimes instead of always aiming dead center.


             CosmopolitanArcade:  Absolutely! But where's that line? Tougher than expected, right?


         WalrusWhisper:  Compromising too much risks becoming reactive instead of proactive in personal growth—even within partnerships. 


     TangyZephyr:  Solid point! Maybe also underrated—clear boundaries & saying 'no' sometimes?


     WaterWizard:  honestly think everyone romanticizes things too much early on - just keep it real rather than overthinking 'us vs. me' stuff so soon!


         ZephyrZebra:  Let's not forget budget talks; money misunderstandings are real joy killers!


             WalrusWhisper:  Romanticizing can sidestep crucial career alignment talks – equally vital!


                 JellyfishBlitz:  and health issues? no one talks bout those roadblocks enough...


         JellyfishBlitz:  happily-ever-after's overrated anyways – just causes grief


     NobleNightingale:  wish i'd known no fairy tales here; real effort required


         JellyfishBlitz:  romance takes work, just like wine-making


         ZephyrZebra:  Independent goals are crucial too! Sharing dreams can't mean giving up personal ones; both fuel growth in relationships way more than just lovey-dovey vibes alone.


         BopsieBunny:  Effort yes, but effective communication? Crucial.
