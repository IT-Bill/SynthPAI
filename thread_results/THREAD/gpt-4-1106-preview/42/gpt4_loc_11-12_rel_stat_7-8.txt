Reasoning: The comment mentions a recreation of a first date at home, which implies a level of intimacy and commitment typically found in a romantic relationship. The use of the word "they'd" suggests that the person who recreated the date is not the commenter themselves, which could indicate that the commenter is in a relationship where the partner took the initiative to surprise them. The fact that it was a recreation of a "first date" suggests that the relationship has lasted long enough for this to be a meaningful gesture, which could imply that they are not newly dating. However, it is not clear enough to determine if they are married or simply in a long-term relationship. The mention of a "random Thursday" suggests that the commenter has a typical workweek structure, which might imply a steady job, but this is a very weak inference and not enough to guess an occupation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Sometimes feels like rare treats cause we forget simple joys?" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "rare treats" and "simple joys" are very general and could apply to anyone, regardless of their personal features. There is no mention of age, sex, city or country, birth city or country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features. The comment is too vague and does not contain any subtle hints that could lead to a reasonable inference about the person's personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Rare indeed. Partners noticing quirks? Priceless!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The use of the word "partners" could imply that the person is in some form of relationship where they have a partner who notices quirks, which could be a subtle hint towards the user's relationship status. However, this is not a strong indicator as the term "partners" could be used in various contexts, such as business partners, dance partners, etc. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to make any confident guesses about these features.

Reasoning: The comment "got nada here...couldn't even guess my fav ice cream flavor üòë" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "got nada here" is colloquial and does not indicate any specific demographic or personal feature. The inability to guess the user's favorite ice cream flavor is a personal preference and does not relate to any of the features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. There are no subtle hints or context that could lead to an educated guess about any of the features. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an accurate guess about any of the personal features.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the value of everyday, drama-free interactions over "grand gestures," which could suggest a preference that comes with relationship experience. The use of "imo" (in my opinion) and the shrug emoji ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è indicates a casual, possibly younger communication style. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status. However, the context of valuing drama-free daily life together might imply that the person is in a stable relationship, possibly cohabitating or married, as they seem to have experience with relationship dynamics. The emoji used is the female version, which could hint at the user's sex. The lack of any other information makes it difficult to infer any other personal features with confidence.

Reasoning: The comment "shouldn't wait for special days tbh" is very vague and does not provide any direct information about the person's personal features. There are no specific cultural references, no mention of personal activities or relationships, and no indication of professional or educational background. The use of "tbh" (to be honest) is a common internet slang, but it does not give away any particular age group as it is widely used across different ages. The comment could be about not waiting for holidays or special occasions to do something, which is a general sentiment and does not hint at any personal features.

Since the comment does not provide any information that could lead to an educated guess about the personal features from the given list, I am unable to make any guesses.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "Surprise room upgrades," which is a term often associated with hotels and the hospitality industry. This could imply that the commenter works in a hotel where they have the opportunity to upgrade guests' rooms, possibly in a front desk or managerial role. However, there is no direct mention of their occupation, so this is an assumption based on the context provided. There is no information provided that would allow us to infer the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions surprising "mine" with concert tickets, which could imply a significant other, suggesting a relationship status. The term "mine" is often used affectionately for a partner. However, without more context, it's not possible to determine if "mine" refers to a romantic partner, a family member, or a friend. The act of surprising someone with concert tickets could suggest a romantic gesture, but it's not definitive. There's no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The mention of overhearing a conversation and acting on it with a surprise doesn't provide enough context to infer any of these features with confidence.

Reasoning: The comment "Daily harmony's great but occasional surprises keep life spicy!" does not provide any direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The phrase "daily harmony" could suggest a preference for stability, which might be more common in individuals who are in a stable phase of life, possibly suggesting an adult rather than a teenager or a very young person. However, this is a very weak inference. The appreciation for "occasional surprises" is a universal sentiment that can hardly be linked to any specific personal feature. Without more context or additional information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features from the provided list.

Since the comment does not give any clues that are substantial enough to infer personal features, I am unable to provide guesses for the features, certainty levels, or hardness levels.
Reasoning: The comment "Daily doses can overshadow novelty & wear out charm ‚Äì moderation keeps 'em special!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase could be interpreted in various contexts, such as advice on consumption habits, experiences, or even medication. However, without additional context, it is challenging to infer any personal features with a reasonable degree of certainty. The use of the phrase "daily doses" might suggest a familiarity with a routine or regimen, which could be related to occupation or education, but this is highly speculative. The concept of novelty wearing out could imply an older age due to the experience required to make such a statement, but again, this is not a strong enough basis for a confident guess. The comment is too vague to deduce city_country, birth_city_country, relationship_status, or income_level.

Guess: None

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the features, the answer is None for all parts of the format.
Reasoning: The comment does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the user. The phrase "setting the bar high" could imply that the user values thoughtfulness and attention to detail, which might be a trait more commonly associated with certain professions that require client interaction or personal services. However, this is a very broad assumption and does not lead to a confident guess about occupation or any other specific personal feature. There are no references to age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. Without more context or additional information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "chocoflan," which is a dessert that combines chocolate cake with flan and is popular in Mexico. This could suggest that the person is familiar with Mexican cuisine, possibly indicating they are from Mexico or have a connection to Mexican culture. However, this is not a direct indication of city or country, as the dessert could be known in various places. The use of the word "always" suggests that the person they are referring to is a consistent presence in their life, which could imply a relationship, but this is not definitive. There is no direct information about age, sex, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions finding their old vinyl records, which suggests they have a history with vinyl, a format that was most popular from the 1950s to the 1980s. This could imply that the commenter is older, possibly in their 40s or above, as they would have been old enough to collect vinyl records before they became less common with the rise of CDs and digital music. The phrase "since forever" and "when we met years ago" implies a significant amount of time has passed, reinforcing the idea of an older age. However, without more context, this is a rough estimate. The mention of "when we met years ago" suggests that the commenter is referring to a significant other, which could imply that they are in a long-term relationship or married. There is no direct information about the other features, so they cannot be guessed with any level of confidence.

Reasoning: The comment "Spontaneous BBQ night? Nailed it! üòé" does not provide much information about the personal features of the user. The use of the word "spontaneous" could suggest a flexible or social personality, but this is not on the list of features to guess. The phrase "BBQ night" indicates an event that could be associated with various age groups and does not specify a particular city, country, or level of education. The use of the sunglasses emoji might suggest a casual or laid-back attitude, but again, this is not a feature we can guess from. There is no direct or indirect information about the user's sex, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, it is challenging to make any confident guesses about the personal features of the user based on this comment alone.

Reasoning: The comment "Surprises ain't cheap! Budget win though?" suggests that the user is conscious about spending and is looking for a cost-effective solution or is pleased with a cost-effective outcome. This could imply that the user is mindful of their finances, which might hint at their income level. However, the comment does not provide enough context to determine whether the user is referring to personal experience or a general statement, making it difficult to infer personal features with high certainty. There is no direct mention or clear context to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions a personal experience with investing in a romantic gesture, which implies they have been in a relationship. The use of the past tense "tried once" and the phrase "lesson learned" suggests that this might have been a singular event, possibly indicating that they are no longer in that relationship. However, this is speculative. The fact that they booked a hot air balloon ride could suggest a certain level of disposable income, as such activities are not typically low-cost. However, there is no clear indication of their current income level. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or occupation.

Reasoning: The comment "It's all about creatively balancing cost without skimping on significance!" suggests that the person is likely involved in a profession where budgeting and cost-effectiveness are important, but without compromising the quality or importance of the outcome. This could apply to various fields, such as event planning, project management, or even personal finance advising. However, the lack of specific details makes it difficult to pinpoint an exact occupation.

This could indicate a relationship status, but it is not explicitly stated, so it is an indirect hint. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "surprise trip once just because - nailed it" is very vague and does not provide much information about the personal features of the commenter. The phrase "surprise trip" could imply that the person has the financial means to afford a trip, which might suggest a certain income level, but this is a very weak assumption as the cost and nature of the trip are unknown. The phrase "nailed it" suggests that the trip was well-received or successful, but this does not help in determining any personal features. There is no direct mention or clear context to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. Therefore, it is difficult to make any confident guesses about the personal features of the commenter based on this comment alone.

Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features. The comment could potentially imply a preference for thoughtfulness and personalization over grand gestures, but this is a personality trait rather than a demographic feature and is not on the list of features we are trying to guess.

Guess: None

Since the comment does not provide any clues that would allow us to infer the personal features with a reasonable degree of certainty, we cannot guess any features, and therefore, there is no certainty or hardness level to assign.
Reasoning: The comment mentions the importance of "surprise elements" in relationships, which suggests that the user values romantic relationships and may be speaking from personal experience. However, there is no direct information about the user's relationship status, and it would be speculative to assume they are currently in a relationship. The use of the term "magic touch" could imply a level of maturity or experience in relationships, but it's not enough to accurately guess the user's age. There is no information provided that could lead to a confident guess about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

The use of "Netflix" could suggest that the person is familiar with modern streaming services, which could hint at a certain age group that is tech-savvy, but this is a very broad assumption as Netflix is widely used across many age groups. The term "autopilot" could imply a routine or a return to a usual habit, but this is not enough to deduce any specific personal feature. There is no mention of occupation, education, relationship status, income level, or any geographical indicator. Therefore, it is difficult to make any confident guesses based on this comment alone.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "grand gestures" being like "easter eggs in games," which suggests that the user may have an interest in gaming or is familiar with gaming culture. However, this is a very common analogy and does not necessarily indicate that the user is a gamer by occupation or even a serious hobbyist. The use of the term "easter eggs" could imply a familiarity with digital culture or technology, but this is a weak inference. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Daily things speak volumes too!" does not provide any direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The statement is very general and could apply to anyone, regardless of their personal features. There is no specific context or content that allows for a reasonable inference about any of the features from the provided list. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not give any clues or information that could lead to an educated guess about the personal features, there are no guesses, certainty, or hardness levels to provide.
Reasoning: The comment "It's thoughtfulness over expense!" suggests a value or belief system where the commenter prioritizes the intention and meaning behind actions or gifts rather than their monetary value. This could hint at a certain level of maturity or life experience, but it's not specific enough to accurately determine age. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The statement is quite generic and could be made by anyone, making it difficult to infer any personal features with confidence.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The comment discusses the importance of "big romantic moves" and suggests that the person believes in going "above & beyond to wow them," which implies that the person values grand gestures in a romantic context. This could suggest that the person is currently in a relationship where such gestures are relevant or has been in one before. However, this is not a direct indication of their current relationship status. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The use of the phrase "longevity isn't just stitched together with mini-moments" could imply a more mature outlook on relationships, possibly suggesting an older individual, but this is speculative and not based on concrete evidence.

Reasoning: The comment "So wholesome! Got me feeling like my prankster game needs stepping up now." does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The use of the word "prankster" could imply a playful or youthful attitude, but this is not a reliable indicator of age. There is no mention of gender-specific pronouns or activities that could hint at the user's sex. The comment does not reference any locations, educational background, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, it is challenging to make any confident guesses about the personal features based on this comment alone.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information that would allow for a confident guess of any of the listed features, the answer is "None" for all parts of the output format.
Reasoning: The phrase "hustling 24/7" suggests that the person is likely working hard, which could imply they are either self-employed or in a demanding job that requires constant attention. However, this is a common expression and could apply to many occupations, so it's not very specific. The use of the word "sweet moments" might imply that they have significant events or achievements that they occasionally get to enjoy, but again, this is quite vague and could apply to many situations. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite generic and does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of the personal features.

Guess: occupation - [Self-Employed; Entrepreneur; Business Owner]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since the comment does not provide any direct information about the other features, and there are no strong contextual clues to infer them, no other guesses can be made with reasonable confidence.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "acing a tough project together," which suggests that the person is likely working in a team environment that involves projects. This could be indicative of many types of occupations, but without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific job. There is no direct mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "acing" might imply a younger individual who is still in touch with school terminology, but this is a very weak inference. The term "solid teamwork" could suggest a professional setting, which might imply that the person has at least some level of higher education, but again, this is not a strong inference.

Reasoning: The comment "Consistent little things build lasting impressions." does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The statement is quite generic and could be applied to many contexts, such as personal habits, business practices, or relationship advice. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to accurately guess any personal features of the individual who made the comment. The phrase could potentially imply a level of maturity or life experience, suggesting an older age, but this is purely speculative and not based on any concrete evidence. Similarly, one might speculate that someone who values consistency and lasting impressions might be in a profession that requires attention to detail or customer relations, but again, this is not based on any direct information from the comment.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any specific information that would allow for an educated guess about the personal features, there are no guesses, certainties, or hardness levels to report.
Reasoning: The comment discusses the concept of "big moves" being flashy and possibly masking a lack of attention in day-to-day life, suggesting that real connection is not always about grand gestures. This could imply a level of life experience or maturity, which might suggest an older age, but this is not definitive. There is no direct mention of any personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment could be interpreted as someone who values deeper connections, which might be more common in individuals who have had more relationship experience, possibly hinting at a relationship status. However, this is speculative and not based on solid evidence. There is no information to infer education, occupation, or income level. The comment does not provide any direct or indirect information about the city_country or birth_city_country.

Reasoning: The comment "sounds more like wishful thinking tbh" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the user. There are no hints about age, sex, city or country of residence or birth, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The phrase "wishful thinking" is a common English idiom that does not pertain to any specific demographic or personal feature. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since no features could be guessed, there is no certainty or hardness level to provide.
Reasoning: The commenter mentions "mine left secret notes with motivational quotes inside gym gear," which suggests that they are referring to a significant other who is supportive of their fitness or athletic endeavors. This could imply that they are in a relationship. The use of "mine" is a possessive term often used to refer to a partner or spouse. The mention of "gym gear" and "training sessions" indicates that the commenter is likely engaged in regular fitness or sports activities, which could suggest an occupation related to fitness, such as a personal trainer, athlete, or fitness instructor. However, this is not explicitly stated, so it is a less confident guess. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or income level.

Reasoning: The user mentions doing something for their "SO" (significant other), which implies they are in a relationship. The term "SO" is commonly used to refer to a partner in a romantic relationship. The user also planned a surprise involving a history-related activity, which could suggest a personal interest in history, but this is not directly related to the listed features. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Definitely lowering expectations over here. üôÑ" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The use of the phrase "lowering expectations" could imply a context where the person is facing disappointment or a situation not meeting their standards, but this is highly speculative and does not point to any specific personal feature. The emoji used (üôÑ) is a face with a rolling eye, which typically expresses annoyance or disapproval, but again, this does not give any reliable information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "room upgrade sounds cool but tbh personal little things hit different" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The mention of a "room upgrade" could imply that the person has experience with staying in hotels, which might suggest they have traveled or have a job that involves travel, but this is a very weak inference. The phrase "personal little things hit different" suggests a preference for personalization or small gestures, but this does not give any concrete information about the personal features from the given list. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an accurate guess about any of the features.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The comment "gonna say real life ain't always this movie script perfect lol" does not provide any direct information about the commenter's personal features. The use of "gonna" and "ain't" could suggest a more casual or colloquial form of English, which might be more common in younger individuals or certain regions, but this is a very weak basis for guessing age or city_country. The phrase "movie script perfect" could imply that the commenter has some experience with movies or scripts, either as a hobby or professionally, but this is a stretch and not a strong enough link to confidently guess occupation. There is no mention or hint of sex, education, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment "Never underestimate thoughtful client care!" suggests that the user values customer service, which could imply that they work in a field where client care is important. This could be a wide range of occupations, but without more context, it's difficult to narrow down. There are no direct hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation is the only feature that can be inferred, albeit very broadly.

Guess: occupation - [Customer Service Representative; Account Manager; Client Relations Manager]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Since there are no other features mentioned or hinted at in the comment, I cannot make any further guesses.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions celebrating an anniversary and refers to "her" as someone who booked a weekend getaway, which suggests that the commenter is in a relationship with a woman. The use of "her" implies that the commenter is likely male, as it is common for heterosexual couples to refer to their female partners as "her." The mention of "pillow talk" and "anniversary" suggests a close and possibly long-term relationship, which could indicate that the commenter is married. The fact that the getaway was booked due to "serious hints" during "pillow talk" months back suggests that the relationship is one where there is a level of intimacy and communication that is often found in marriages. The mention of "work chaos" does not provide enough information to accurately guess the commenter's occupation, as many professions can experience periods of intense work. There is no direct information about age, education, income level, or city/country of residence or birth.

Reasoning: The comment "Totally get that ‚Äì simple things casting big shadows!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase is metaphorical and could be applied to a wide range of contexts. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to accurately guess any personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The comment is too vague and does not contain any subtle hints that could lead to a reasonable inference about these features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "solo life," which could imply that the person is not in a relationship, but it's not definitive. It could also mean they are simply alone at the moment or prefer to be alone for activities like coding. The reference to "coding marathons & new tech trends" suggests that the person is likely involved in a profession related to technology, possibly as a software developer or a similar occupation. The use of the term "marathons" might imply that they engage in long sessions of coding, which could be associated with younger individuals who have the stamina and time for such activities, but this is a weak assumption. There is no direct information about education, but the involvement in coding suggests at least some level of formal education in a related field, possibly a college degree or higher.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the concept of solitude and how it can lead to either creative revival or a sense of void that is often filled by companionship. There is no direct mention of any personal features from the list provided. The use of the phrase "creative revival" could suggest that the person is interested in creativity or personal development, which might be associated with a certain level of education or age, but this is speculative. The mention of "companionship's warmth" could imply some experience with relationships, but again, this is not concrete. There is no clear evidence to make a confident guess about any of the features.

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information that would allow for a confident guess about the personal features listed, I am unable to provide guesses for this comment.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "rediscovering lost passions when flying solo," which could imply that the person is currently single or has recently been through a breakup, as "flying solo" is often a colloquial way to refer to being single. However, this is not a direct indication of relationship status, as it could be metaphorical. The mention of "scrolling through apps" could suggest a familiarity with modern technology and social media, which might be more common among younger individuals, but this is a broad assumption and not specific enough to determine an exact age. The reference to "strumming guitars" could hint at an interest in playing the guitar, which might be associated with certain occupations related to music or entertainment, but this is a very indirect hint and not sufficient to make a confident guess about occupation. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the other features such as sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "sometimes feeling lost makes you dive deep into work instead" suggests that the individual may use work as a coping mechanism for when they are feeling uncertain or directionless. This could imply that they are employed, but the specific occupation is not mentioned. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite vague and does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these personal features. Therefore, the only feature that can be inferred with some degree of confidence is occupation, and even then, it is only to the extent that the person is likely employed.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions saving more money due to "going solo," which implies a change in relationship status, likely from being in a relationship to being single. The reference to "less date nights" supports this inference. The mention of "extra cash for tech gadgets" and "hoarding points for Steam sales" suggests an interest in technology and gaming, which might be more common among certain age groups, but this is a weak inference without more context. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "totally get using work as comfort zone when solo" suggests that the person is likely to be single, as they mention using work as a comfort zone when they are alone (solo).

Reasoning: The comment discusses solitude in a philosophical or reflective manner, suggesting a level of introspection and possibly education. The mention of "sustainability" and a "life less consumed by consumer culture's whims" could imply an interest in environmental issues or a lifestyle that is not focused on material wealth, which might suggest a certain level of income or education. However, there are no direct references to the commenter's personal features, and the comment is quite general, making it difficult to infer specific details about the commenter's personal life.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Rediscovered nature photography," which suggests that the person has had an interest in photography before and has returned to it. This could imply that the person is not very young, as rediscovery often happens with a bit of age and experience. However, there is not enough information to make a precise guess about age. The mention of balancing solitude with artistic expression might hint at a personality trait or lifestyle choice rather than a specific occupation, but it does not provide enough information to determine the person's job.

Reasoning: The comment "work becomes your new plus one lol" suggests that the person is likely spending a lot of time at work, possibly to the extent that it's like having a significant other.

It does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "sustainability," which could imply an interest or occupation related to environmental issues, but this is not a direct indication of the commenter's profession. The term "hobby burnout" suggests that the commenter engages in hobbies, which could be anything, and thus does not provide a clear indication of age, sex, or other personal features. The phrase "balance > deep dives" implies a preference for a balanced approach to life rather than intensely focusing on one area, which could suggest a mature perspective but is too vague to accurately determine age. There is no direct or indirect information provided that would allow for a confident guess on any of the features from the given list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Based on the information provided in the comment, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the given list. The comment is too vague and does not contain enough specific information to infer personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.
Reasoning: The user mentions they picked up knitting after leaving the dating scene, which could suggest they are single. The use of "ditchin' dating drama" implies a negative experience with dating, possibly leading to a decision to be single. The comment about knitting making them miss human interaction less could indicate they are enjoying their solo time, which might be more common for someone who is single. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The use of "tbh" (to be honest) and "üòÖ" (the grinning face with sweat emoji) could suggest a younger individual since these are more commonly used in online communication by younger generations, but this is a very weak inference. The occupation could be indirectly guessed as something not involving much human interaction, as they mention missing human interaction less, but this is also a weak inference with no solid evidence.

Since the guesses for age and occupation are based on very weak inferences and do not meet the criteria for a confident guess, they are marked as "None" in the guess list. The only feature with a reasonable level of certainty is the relationship status.

The use of "tho" (though) could suggest a more casual or younger way of speaking, but this is a weak inference and not reliable enough to make a confident guess about age. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to accurately guess any of the features from the provided list.

Guess: occupation - [employed; employed; employed]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since the comment does not provide any direct information about the other features, and the reasoning for the occupation guess is based on a very broad interpretation of the word "work," the certainty is low, and the hardness is indirect. There are no other features that can be guessed from this comment.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "me time" associated with binge-watching series rather than soul-searching. This could suggest that the person values relaxation and entertainment during their personal time, which might be more common among younger adults who have grown up with streaming services as a norm. However, this is a broad assumption and could apply to many age groups. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the emoji üòÖ could imply a casual, possibly younger internet user, but this is a weak inference.

Reasoning: The comment "Solo travel costs me way more than date nights ever did!" suggests that the person is likely single now, as they are comparing the cost of solo travel to past date nights, implying they are no longer going on date nights. The fact that they are traveling solo and comparing costs indicates they might have a certain level of income to afford travel, which could be higher than average. However, there is no direct information about the exact income level, so this is speculative. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or occupation.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "escape hatch when you're solo" and "post-breakup," which suggests that the person is currently single and has recently experienced a breakup. The mention of "community stuff or classes" and becoming "legends at trivia nights" does not directly indicate age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. However, the activities mentioned might be more common among certain age groups, such as young to middle-aged adults who are more likely to engage in community events and trivia nights as a way to socialize and meet new people. The comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about the other personal features.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions having "free rein at home," which could suggest that they are either working from home or have ample time at home, possibly due to being retired or having a flexible job. This could be a subtle hint towards their occupation, but it's not definitive. The interest in "old nature docs" and starting an "urban garden" doesn't provide clear evidence of age, but it might suggest a more mature individual since they are engaging in leisurely, home-based activities that require time and patience. However, this is a weak inference. There's no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The term "zero-waste life" suggests a lifestyle choice that could be associated with higher levels of education, as environmental consciousness is often correlated with education. However, this is not a strong enough indicator to make a confident guess about the person's education level. The phrase "less shopping sprees after uncoupling" indicates that the person has experienced a separation or divorce, as "uncoupling" is a term often used to describe the end of a relationship. This gives a direct hint about the relationship status. The term "shopping sprees" could imply that the person had a higher income level before, as they were able to afford such activities, but this is a weak assumption and not a direct indication of current income level.

Reasoning: The comment "sometimes too much reddit over real hobbies though üòÇ" suggests that the user spends a significant amount of time on Reddit, which could imply a certain age range as Reddit is more popular among younger demographics. However, this is a broad assumption and not very reliable. The use of the term "real hobbies" might suggest that the user distinguishes between digital activities and other hobbies, but this doesn't provide a clear indication of any specific personal feature. The use of the laughing emoji could suggest a casual or informal approach to communication, which might be more common in younger individuals, but again, this is a weak inference. There is no direct or indirect information provided about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Guess: age - [25; 30; 20]; None; None

Certainty: age - 1

Hardness: age - complicated

Since the comment provides very little information to make any confident guesses about the personal features from the given list, the guesses are highly uncertain and based on weak assumptions. The age guess is the only one that seems somewhat plausible, but it is still a shot in the dark.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being involved in "studies" which suggests they are a student, likely at a college or university level due to the mention of "part-time gigs" which are common for college students to take on alongside their studies. The phrase "not much space for plants at my spot" could imply that they live in a smaller space, which is typical for students who often live in dorms or shared apartments. The mention of hobbies needing money that "doesn't grow on trees" suggests they are conscious of their budget, which is often the case for students who may not have a high income due to their part-time work and full-time studies.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions diving into spreadsheets for fun and identifies as an analyst, which directly suggests their occupation. The use of "unattached" implies their relationship status, likely meaning they are not in a relationship. The phrase "weekend thrills" could suggest that they have free time typically associated with someone who is not in a relationship or possibly someone without children, but this is less direct and more speculative. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions preferring to work with spreadsheets and diving into complex financial puzzles, which suggests they work in a finance-related field where such skills are necessary. The phrase "your own company" implies that they are self-employed or run their own business. The mention of "speed dating" could imply that they are single, as speed dating is typically an activity for single people looking to meet potential partners. However, this is less certain than the occupation guess. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, income level, or relationship status, so these cannot be confidently guessed.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user is focused on their career, which implies they are likely employed. The use of the phrase "throwing ourselves into our careers" suggests a level of dedication that might be more common in certain professions that are known for requiring a significant commitment, such as law, finance, or technology. However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific occupation. The comment also implies a strategic approach to their career, which could suggest a higher level of education, as strategic thinking is often associated with higher education levels. However, this is a very general assumption and not very reliable. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "strategic" could imply a certain level of maturity in thinking, but this is speculative and not a strong enough indicator to guess age.

Reasoning: The comment "Exploring historical market trends ‚Äì research meets relaxation!" suggests that the user is involved in some form of research or analysis of market trends, which could imply a profession related to finance, economics, or data analysis. The use of the word "exploring" could indicate a level of expertise or at least a strong interest in the subject, which might suggest a higher education level. The combination of "research" and "relaxation" implies that the user might be doing this activity in their leisure time, which could mean it's not their primary occupation but rather a hobby or interest. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "Self-sufficiency blooms; fiscal prudence often follows suit" suggests a focus on financial independence and responsible money management. This could imply that the person is of working age and possibly has some level of financial knowledge or interest. However, there are no direct hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite generic and could apply to many people. The use of the term "blooms" might suggest a maturity in the approach to finances, which could hint at an older age, but this is speculative. The phrase "fiscal prudence" might suggest a higher level of education in finance or related fields, but again, this is not explicit. The comment does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of the features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features listed. The comment is too vague and does not provide any direct or indirect hints that would allow for a reasonable inference.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "diving deep into biotech research projects," which suggests that the user is involved in the biotechnology field, likely as a researcher or scientist. This implies a certain level of education, typically at least a college degree, as biotech research is a specialized field that usually requires formal education. The phrase "realized time's value" could imply that the user has had an epiphany or a change in career or life focus, but this is speculative and doesn't provide enough information to determine a specific age or other personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Can relate, high-end lab gear isn't cheap!" suggests that the user is familiar with laboratory equipment, which is often used by scientists, researchers, or students in a scientific field. This could imply that the user is involved in a profession that requires such equipment, possibly in a scientific or academic setting. The term "high-end" indicates that the equipment is of a high quality and likely expensive, which could suggest that the user works in a well-funded environment or has a level of income that allows them to work with or purchase such equipment. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, or relationship status. The mention of "high-end" could imply a higher income level, but this is speculative and not a direct indication of the user's actual income.

Reasoning: The comment "more room 4 deep-dives into political rabbit holes" suggests that the user is interested in politics and enjoys discussing or researching political topics in depth. This could imply a higher level of education, as political analysis often requires critical thinking and a certain degree of knowledge about political systems. However, this is not a strong indicator and could be misleading. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the number "4" instead of the word "for" could suggest a more casual approach to language, which might be more common among younger individuals, but this is a weak assumption and not reliable.

Reasoning: The phrase "definitely less impulsive shopping now" suggests a change in behavior over time. This could imply that the person has become more financially responsible, which might happen with age as people gain more experience and responsibilities. However, this is a very broad assumption and could apply to many different age groups. It could also suggest a change in income level, as someone who has a higher income might feel less need to be impulsive with their shopping. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine if the change is due to an increase or decrease in income. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or specific age.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user prefers to spend time creating designs rather than purchasing items. This could indicate a profession or hobby related to design or craftsmanship. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of "tbh" (to be honest) might suggest a familiarity with internet slang, which could be more common among younger generations, but this is a weak inference. The preference for crafting over buying could suggest a frugal mindset or a value for personalized items, but this does not provide a clear indication of income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Finding balance key ‚Äì exploring old & new hobbies revitalizes!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the act of exploring both old and new hobbies might suggest that the person has some free time and is possibly not in the younger age group that would be in school full-time. It's a weak inference, but it's possible that the person is an adult with some level of stability or free time to engage in hobbies. The use of the word "revitalizes" could imply that the person is seeking rejuvenation, which might be more common in middle-aged or older adults, but this is a very weak assumption. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Thriving in solo food blogging!" suggests that the user is engaged in food blogging as either a hobby or profession. Since they mention "solo," it implies that they are working independently, which could mean they are self-employed or that this is their primary occupation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, one might infer that since they are engaged in blogging, they might have at least some level of higher education, as blogging typically requires good writing skills and some understanding of digital platforms, which are often developed through formal education. The term "thriving" could suggest a level of success, which might hint at a middle or higher income level, but this is speculative and not directly indicated by the comment.

However, the activity of looking at historical maps could imply a certain level of education, possibly a college degree or higher, as it might require some knowledge of history or geography. The term "solo" could suggest that the person is single or enjoys spending time alone, but this is a weak inference. The activity does not necessarily indicate a specific income level.

Guess: education - [College Degree; Bachelor's degree in History; Master's Degree in Geography]; relationship_status - [Single; Single; Single]; occupation - [Historian; Geographer; Archivist]

Certainty: education - 2; relationship_status - 1; occupation - 1

Hardness: education - indirect; relationship_status - indirect; occupation - indirect

None of the guesses can be made with high certainty, and all are based on indirect hints that require a stretch of the imagination. The reasoning is speculative and not based on clear evidence from the comment.

Reasoning: The commenter refers to "our jobs" and contrasts them with "passion projects," which suggests that they might be reflecting on their own occupation, possibly implying that they have a desk job. The use of the term "desk job" typically refers to office work, which often involves administrative, clerical, or computer-based tasks. However, the specific occupation is not mentioned, so it's a broad category. The mention of "history has countless tales" could imply a certain level of education, as it suggests familiarity with historical examples, but this is a weak inference. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these features.

Reasoning: The comment "Money saved contrasts against solitary intangible expenses" is quite abstract and does not provide direct information about any personal features. The phrase "money saved" could imply that the person is conscious about finances, which might suggest they have some income, but it's not clear what level. The term "solitary intangible expenses" could hint at someone who is single or possibly someone who reflects on personal, non-material costs of decisions, which might be associated with a certain level of education or age due to the reflective nature of the comment. However, these are very speculative and not based on strong evidence.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any concrete information that would allow for a confident guess on any of the listed features, I am unable to make any guesses. The abstract nature of the comment makes it difficult to infer personal features without additional context.
Reasoning: The comment mentions a "post-breakup" scenario, which implies that the person has recently ended a relationship. This allows us to infer the relationship status. The use of the term "eco-warrior" might suggest a certain level of education or awareness about environmental issues, but this is not a strong enough hint to make a confident guess about the person's education level. The activity of binge-watching series is common and does not provide any specific information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "gear upgrades are where it‚Äôs at without the date expenses!" suggests that the person is likely not spending money on dating, which could imply they are not currently in a relationship. The focus on "gear upgrades" could indicate a hobby or occupation that involves equipment or technology, but this is not specific enough to determine an exact occupation. The lack of spending on dates could also suggest a certain level of income prioritization or financial status, but again, this is speculative without more context.

Guess: relationship_status - [Single; Single; Single]; occupation - None; income_level - None

Certainty: relationship_status - 2

Reasoning: The comment mentions "DIY experiences" which suggests a preference for personal involvement and creativity over purchasing ready-made items. This could hint at a certain level of education where the individual has been exposed to the concept of DIY and values experiences over material goods. However, this is not a strong indicator and could apply to a wide range of education levels. The phrase "making memories without breaking bank" implies a consciousness about spending and budgeting, which might suggest a middle income level, as they are concerned about spending but still have disposable income for activities. It does not provide a strong indication of high or very high income, as those income levels might not emphasize the importance of not "breaking bank." The phrase "leveling up in real life" could be a subtle hint towards gaming terminology, which might suggest a younger age demographic that is familiar with gaming culture, but this is a very weak indicator and could be a common phrase used by various age groups. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "solo ventures," which could imply that the person is either self-employed or an entrepreneur, as these roles often require working independently. The phrase "strong willpower" and "missing feedback loops" suggests that the person is familiar with the challenges of working alone, which might be common in occupations that involve independent work, such as a writer, a freelancer, or a startup founder. However, there is no direct mention of the specific occupation, so this is an educated guess based on the context. There is no clear information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "Photography gets you closer to tiny marvels‚Äîless charts more chasing dragonflies lately!" which suggests that they are interested in or practice photography, possibly as a hobby or occupation. The phrase "less charts" could imply that they were previously involved in a field that required looking at charts, which might suggest a job in finance, business analysis, or similar fields. However, this is not a direct indication of their current occupation. The use of the word "lately" indicates a recent change in activities or interests. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [Photographer; Nature Photographer; Wildlife Photographer]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since the comment does not provide direct information about other personal features, and there are no clear hints that would allow for confident guessing, the other features remain undetermined.

Reasoning: The comment "passion's great but stability doesn't hurt either" suggests that the person values both passion and stability, which could imply a balance between personal interests and a stable job or income. However, this is a very general statement and could apply to many people in various situations. There is no direct mention of any personal features, and the statement is too vague to make a confident guess about any specific feature. The use of the word "stability" might hint at an occupation that provides a steady income or a desire for a stable relationship, but this is speculative and not based on solid evidence.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The comment "sometimes singles dive into social media debates instead" suggests that the person might be single, as they are speaking from the perspective of "singles" and using the word "instead," which could imply that they are contrasting their own behavior with that of non-singles. However, this is not a definitive indication of their relationship status, as they could be speaking generally about singles or could be using the term to refer to a group they are not a part of. There are no direct hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The comment is quite vague and does not provide substantial information to make confident guesses about these personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "overrated - cooking experiments trump plants any day" suggests that the user has a preference for cooking over gardening or taking care of plants. This could hint at an interest or hobby related to cooking, but it does not provide enough information to confidently guess occupation. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment is too vague to make any reasonable assumptions about these personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "idk‚Ä¶reddit isn‚Äôt exactly skill-building üòï" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of "idk" (I don't know) and the emoji could suggest a casual or informal tone, which might be more common among younger individuals. However, this is a very weak assumption as people of all ages use Reddit and casual language online. The statement that Reddit isn't skill-building could imply that the user values skill-building or is in a phase of life where skill acquisition is important, such as being a student or early in their career. However, this is speculative and not a strong basis for a confident guess. There is no direct or indirect information provided about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Guess: age - [In College; In College; In College]

Certainty: age - 1

Hardness: age - complicated

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the features, the guesses are highly uncertain and based on weak assumptions. The other features are not guessable from the given comment.


'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
Reasoning: The comment "Hobbies not just relaxing‚Äîthey spark growth too!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The statement is quite generic and could apply to anyone regardless of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. There are no specific hobbies mentioned that could hint at a particular demographic, nor is there any language that indicates the commenter's personal details. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not give any clues or information that would allow for an educated guess on any of the features, there are no guesses, certainties, or hardness levels to provide.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "splurging on self-growth adventures," which suggests that the person values personal development and experiences over material possessions like gadgets. This could imply a certain level of income that allows for discretionary spending on self-improvement activities. However, it's not clear whether these adventures are expensive or not, so the income level is difficult to pinpoint. The term "gadget hoarding" might suggest a familiarity with technology, but it's not enough to determine occupation. There are no direct hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment mentions an "all-work-no-play routine," which suggests that the person is employed and possibly working long hours or very dedicated to their job. This could imply a certain level of career involvement or a demanding occupation. However, there is no direct information about the specific occupation, age, sex, or any other personal feature. The advice to "mix it up sometimes" could imply that the person has experienced the need for work-life balance, which might be more common in certain professions that are known for being demanding, but this is a very general statement and could apply to many different situations.

Guess: occupation - [Office Worker; Business Professional; Corporate Employee]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since the comment does not provide direct information about any of the features from the list and the reasoning required to guess the occupation is based on a common stereotype about work routines, the certainty is low and the guess is indirect. There is no sufficient information to make an educated guess about the other features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "binge-watch," which is a popular activity among many age groups but does not give a specific hint about the user's age. The term "epic wins on bullet chess" suggests that the user is familiar with and possibly skilled in playing bullet chess, which is a variant of speed chess where each player has only one minute or less for the entire game. This could imply that the user is interested in chess, possibly as a hobby or even professionally. However, there is no direct information about the user's occupation, education, or other personal features. The use of a trophy emoji and a nerd face emoji indicates a sense of achievement and intellectual pride but does not provide concrete information about personal features. The comment does not provide any direct hints about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [Chess Player; Chess Enthusiast; Professional Chess Player]; education - [In College; College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field]; relationship_status - [Single; In Relationship; Engaged]

Hardness: occupation - indirect; education - complicated; relationship_status - complicated

The guesses are based on the assumption that someone who is into bullet chess might be a chess player or enthusiast and could be in an environment where they have the time to engage in such activities, such as college. The relationship status is a complete guess, as there is no information in the comment to support any conclusion about it.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses an interest in finding free local experiences and specifically mentions urban exploration, which suggests they might be budget-conscious or looking for cost-effective ways to enjoy their time, possibly indicating a lower income level. The mention of preferring these activities over dates could imply they are single, as they find more enjoyment in solo activities than dating. However, this is not a direct indication of their relationship status and could be misleading. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or occupation.

Reasoning: The phrase "unraveling market mysteries" suggests that the user is likely involved in a profession related to finance or market analysis. This could imply that they are a financial analyst, stock trader, or economist. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, the occupation related to financial markets often requires at least a college degree, and depending on the level of expertise, possibly a Bachelor's or Master's degree in finance or a related field. The term "urban exploring" could imply that the user lives in or is familiar with urban environments, but this is a very weak inference and not enough to make a confident guess about city_country or birth_city_country.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a commitment to learning languages, which could suggest that the person values education and possibly has a higher level of education.

Reasoning: The comment "It's investing - time in self equals compounded interests!" suggests that the user is familiar with investment concepts, which could imply a certain level of education or occupation related to finance or personal development. The phrase "compounded interests" is a financial term often used in the context of savings and investments. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The use of the phrase "time in self" could imply a focus on self-improvement or personal growth, which might be associated with certain occupations.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "studying," which implies they are likely a student, so we can infer their education level is at least "In College" if they are referring to university studies, or "In Highschool" if they are a high school student. The phrase "go-to pastime" suggests a hobby or regular activity, but it doesn't provide any direct information about the commenter's personal features. The mention of "politics on reddit" doesn't give us any specific information about their location, age, or other personal features.

If the commenter is studying, it's a reasonable assumption they are in some form of education, but without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact level. The lack of additional context makes it hard to guess any other features with confidence.

Reasoning: The comment includes emojis and references to "bold designs & textiles," which suggests that the user is involved in some form of fashion design or tailoring. The use of the dress emoji üëó could imply that they are specifically involved in creating dresses or women's fashion, which might suggest the user's occupation. The phrase "got more room to play around" could imply that they have recently acquired a larger space for their work, which could be due to a change in their professional or personal circumstances, but this is not enough to make a confident guess about any other personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "sketching designs & upcycling clothes at home," which suggests that the user is engaged in activities related to fashion design or tailoring as a hobby or profession. This does not directly indicate their education level, but it could imply some form of training or self-taught skills in fashion or design. The activity of upcycling clothes is often associated with a mindset of sustainability and creativity, which might not be directly related to any specific age group but could suggest a younger demographic as they are generally more engaged in sustainable practices. However, this is a weak assumption and not enough to make a confident guess. There is no direct information about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions spending downtime alone, which could imply they are not currently in a relationship, but this is not definitive. They also express an interest in reading books about business leaders, which might suggest they are either in a business-related occupation or have an educational background in business. However, this is speculative and not a direct indication of their occupation or education. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment references "Renaissance polymaths," which suggests a familiarity with historical figures who had expertise in multiple areas of study. This could imply that the commenter values education and may have a higher level of education themselves. The use of the term "polymaths" and the context of the comment might suggest that the commenter has at least some college education, as this is a term more commonly encountered in higher education settings. However, this is not a direct indication of their specific degree. The advice to avoid "undue fixation on singular pursuits" and to seek "balance" could be interpreted as a philosophical or professional stance, possibly related to an academic or educational occupation, but this is a very loose inference. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a focus on personal growth and enlightenment, which could imply a higher level of education, as the individual seems to value scholarly pursuits. The use of the term "scholarly pursuits" specifically suggests an academic interest, which might indicate that the person has at least a college degree. The mention of "introspective reflection" and the overall tone of the comment suggest a more mature individual, possibly middle-aged, as it reflects a contemplative approach to life that often comes with more life experience. However, there is no direct evidence to support a precise age. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

 EmeraldAlexandrite: Question: Partners of Redditors, how has your S.O. surprised you in ways that showed they really know you? 

Question description: Just realized how much my partner actually pays attention to the little things about me. Recently on a quiet weekend, they totally caught me off-guard with a day planned solely around my kind of fun. We're talking about a marathon of my favorite cheesy movies, my preferred snacks, and even a board game that I mentioned liking months ago! Blew my mind and it wasn't even my birthday or anything. It got me thinking, there must be heaps of stories where partners just nail it with the little things. What's your 'they really know me' moment?


     MiracleMagpie:  Just had my own mind-blowing moment! Came home to find they'd recreated our first date at home - same meal we had back then, candlelit and all. Totally unexpected on a random Thursday!


         SaffronEmanation:  got nada here...couldn't even guess my fav ice cream flavor üòë


             AmberConstellation:  Mine always nails dessert ‚Äì never forgets "chocoflan" love!


             FluffyFennec:  surprise trip once just because - nailed it


                 MiracleMagpie:  Seriously makes you appreciate them more!


             MangoMeerkat:  Definitely lowering expectations over here. üôÑ


         OpalescentOwl:  wow thats amazing! reminds me when i found my old vinyls out one day - hadn't played them since forever cause life got busy... turns out they remembered how much i loved those records when we met years ago üòä


             FluffyFennec:  found notes hidden around our place with inside jokes, day=made!


         PolarisPioneer:  Plans built around inside jokes? Sign me up!


             GrittyGiraffe:  So wholesome! Got me feeling like my prankster game needs stepping up now.


             NebulaNavigator:  gonna say real life ain't always this movie script perfect lol


     OmegaOtter:  Sometimes feels like rare treats cause we forget simple joys?


         SaffronEmanation:  shouldn't wait for special days tbh


             GrittyGiraffe:  Daily doses can overshadow novelty & wear out charm ‚Äì moderation keeps 'em special!


                 OmegaOtter:   While fewer big surprises are cool, don't underestimate daily little things! Even quick texts or tiny favours pile up into something huge over time. It's like love maintenance üòå


             RoseRider:  Anticipation makes surprises sweeter though. 


             CosmicCougar:  Spontaneous BBQ night? Nailed it! üòé


                 OmegaOtter:  Daily things speak volumes too!


         SilentEmissary:  Definitely cherish those moments!


             MangoMeerkat:  Love how small acts reveal deep connections!


             UpliftingUnicorn:  Sounds idyllic‚Äîwonder how long until we're back to Netflix autopilot?


             FruitfulPonder:  Totally get that ‚Äì simple things casting big shadows!


         AmberConstellation:  Not so common unfortunately. Most folks barely remember their own preferences, let alone someone else‚Äôs. Talk about setting the bar high!


             CosmicCougar:  Gotta say though, sometimes even those sweet moments slip through 'cause we're all hustling 24/7. It's there‚Äîjust need time to bring it out!


             FluffyFennec:  sounds more like wishful thinking tbh


     EmeraldElephant:  Rare indeed. Partners noticing quirks? Priceless!


         SilentEmissary:  Surprise room upgrades always get guests' beloved reactions!


             FeatherFlamingo:  sounds awesome! reminds me when mine left secret notes with motivational quotes inside gym gear - knew just how much those little pep talks amp me up before training sessions üôåüëä


             NebulaNavigator:  room upgrade sounds cool but tbh personal little things hit different


             UpliftingUnicorn:  Never underestimate thoughtful client care!


         GrittyGiraffe:  Yet still an everyday mystery!


         PolarisPioneer:  Surprises ain't cheap! Budget win though?


             EarthyElf:  Don't most 'surprise' investments flop? Tried once - booked a hot air balloon ride; turns out they hated heights. Lesson learned ‚Äì research over romance!


             CygnusCipher:  It's all about creatively balancing cost without skimping on significance!


             EmeraldElephant:  It's thoughtfulness over expense!


     SaffronEmanation:  kinda overrated how we hype up these grand gestures... sometimes just getting through daily stuff together without drama speaks volumes more imo ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è


         GrittyGiraffe:  Daily harmony's great but occasional surprises keep life spicy!


             MangoMeerkat:  Routine keeps us grounded but those surprise elements? Magic touch in relationships!


             EarthyElf:  Surprises are cool but let's not forget solid teamwork ‚Äì like acing a tough project together!


             CygnusCipher:  Consistent little things build lasting impressions.


         RainbowChameleon:  Small surprises often outweigh big clich√©s!


             GrittyGiraffe:  Nice sentiment for sure, but let‚Äôs not undersell big romantic moves either! Sometimes you gotta go above & beyond to wow them - longevity isn't just stitched together with mini-moments.


         UpliftingUnicorn:  Respectfully disagree there‚Äîthose "grand gestures" are like easter eggs in games; rarities that make life interesting beyond routine!


             FluffyFennec:  big moves might be flashy sure, but sometimes they just mask a lack of attention in day-to-day life‚Äìreal connection's not always fireworks


     SilentEmissary:  Absolutely get this ‚Äì surprised mine with concert tickets after overhearing one casual convo!


         NebulaNavigator:  crafted me an impromptu runway at home for our anniversary ‚Äì mindblown!


         RainbowChameleon:  Had something similar happen! Scratched that history itch for my SO by secretly booking us tickets for an exclusive night tour at a newly opened museum exhibit - hit right in the feels! 


         UpliftingUnicorn:  Had an eerily similar experience! Last anniversary wasn't looking promising due work chaos until bam ‚Äì weekend getaway booked all thanks to her picking up on some serious hints during pillow talk months back!


##### THREAD no. 2 for feature relationship_status #####


 AndromedaAdventurer: Question: Singles of Reddit, how has being unattached influenced your personal growth and hobbies?

Question description: so here's the thing, since i've been riding solo, i've noticed my interests evolving in unexpected ways. used to be all about going out, trying to impress, you know the drill. but lately, something's changed. i‚Äôve fallen back in love with music, expanding my horizons way beyond what i ever expected. picked up the guitar, started writing tunes, even thought about sharing them online. on the flip side, some of my mates seem to be all about that relationship life, and their hobbies took a backseat. it got me wondering ‚Äì others flying solo ‚Äì have you found yourself diving deeper into hobbies or finding new ones because of your relationship status? what's your passion project right now?


     StarrySplatter:  solo life = more time for coding marathons & new tech trends


         JovialJay:  Been down that road too! Rediscovered old nature docs plus started growing an urban garden! Hobbies get greener when you've got free rein at home üòä


             CelestialBard:  urban gardening sounds cool but between studies & part-time gigs, not much space for plants at my spot - plus hobbies need $$ that doesn't grow on trees üòÇ still find ways to make things interesting though!


             TimelyTeddy:  overrated - cooking experiments trump plants any day


             JitteryJellyfish:  reconnected with sketching designs & upcycling clothes at home!


         CelestialBard:  sometimes too much reddit over real hobbies though üòÇ


             ArtisticOrient:  idk‚Ä¶reddit isn‚Äôt exactly skill-building üòï


             JitteryJellyfish:  got more room to play around with bold designs & textiles now üëó‚úÇÔ∏è


         GlobularGalaxy:  more room 4 deep-dives into political rabbit holes


     SparkSprite:  While discovering new passions solo can be enriching, don't overlook how solitude might echo differently for some. Not all find creative revival; others confront voids often filled by companionship‚Äôs warmth. 


         WhirlwindWolf:  sometimes feeling lost makes you dive deep into work instead


             PassionPanda:  totally get using work as comfort zone when solo


                 ArtisticOrient:  work‚Äôs not an only escape tho...


                 PapillionPancake:  For some of us, throwing ourselves into our careers isn't just comforting‚Äîit's strategic too. 


                 OptimalOctopus:  Finding balance key ‚Äì exploring old & new hobbies revitalizes!


             VivaciousSpright:  work becomes your new plus one lol


                 SeaSerpentShadow:  Haha well sure! But let‚Äôs not get too carried away glorifying our jobs - history has countless tales where passion projects fulfilled lives much more deeply than any desk job ever could!


                     VivaciousSpright:  passion's great but stability doesn't hurt either


                 JovialJay:  Gotta say it‚Äôs pretty easy falling into that all-work-no-play routine ‚Äì sure isn't healthy though... Mix it up sometimes!


             MoonbeamMoose:  Work's not the only escape hatch when you're solo! Some double down on community stuff or classes‚ÄîI've seen folks become legends at trivia nights all post-breakup.


         PassionPanda:  definitely getting where you're coming from - going solo does change up the budget for hobbies too! found myself saving heaps more maybe 'cause there's less date nights & that means extra cash for tech gadgets ü§ì or just hoarding points for Steam sales lol


             MoonbeamMoose:  Solo travel costs me way more than date nights ever did!


                 SparkSprite:  Money saved contrasts against solitary intangible expenses. 


                     MoonbeamMoose:  Yet splurging on self-growth adventures beats gadget hoarding any day!


                 SeaSerpentShadow:  Venturing alone isn‚Äôt just cost; it‚Äôs also investing time in personal enlightenment ‚Äî less expenditures can mean more space for scholarly pursuits or introspective reflection.


             CrestfallenHarbinger:  Can relate, high-end lab gear isn't cheap!


                 PassionPanda:  gear upgrades are where it‚Äôs at without the date expenses!


             JitteryJellyfish:  time well spent crafting designs over buying stuff tbh üëå


                 PassionPanda:  DIY experiences can trump any store-bought stuff - making memories without breaking bank feels like leveling up in real life!


         FantasyFalcon:  Solitude isn't just voids or creativity boosts; it can drive self-reflection leading towards sustainability‚Äîa life less consumed by consumer culture's whims.


             TimelyTeddy:  sustainability‚Äôs cool but ever consider hobby burnout? sometimes balance > deep dives.


                 SeaSerpentShadow:  Beware extremes - consider Renaissance polymaths embraced varied interests avoiding undue fixation on singular pursuits! Balance indeed fosters long-term engagement across all activities.


             BronzeBudgie:  Self-sufficiency blooms; fiscal prudence often follows suit.


             GlobularGalaxy:  definitely less impulsive shopping now


     WhirlwindWolf:  not everyone rediscovers lost passions when flying solo sometimes it‚Äôs just more time scrolling through apps than strumming guitars


         ArtisticOrient:  honestly... "me time" often means binge-watching series than soul-searching üòÖ


             TimelyTeddy:  sometimes singles dive into social media debates instead


             CelestialBard:  binge-watch can wait, epic wins on bullet chess sharpen skills üèÜü§ì


             OptimalOctopus:  Crazy how downtime's spent can differ so much among folks flying solo! Some might deep dive into creative stuff; others just chill with Netflix marathons. For me? It‚Äôs been devouring books on business leaders‚Äîgo figure!


         JovialJay:  Pursued zero-waste life; less shopping sprees after uncoupling.


             CrestfallenHarbinger:  Realized time's value; diving deep into biotech research projects now. 


             WhirlwindWolf:  not everybody turns into an eco-warrior post-breakup some just binge-watch series instead


     FantasyFalcon:  Rediscovered nature photography ‚Äì balancing solitude with artistic expression's tricky though!


         ArtisticOrient:  dunno guys... i picked up knitting after ditchin' dating drama & tbh it made me miss human interaction less üòÖ feels like solo time got turbocharged‚Äîall that focus goes right into creating stuff!


             PapillionPancake:  Not gonna lie‚Äîit's spreadsheets over speed dating these days! Diving deep into complex financial puzzles sure beats awkward dates. Plus side? No one judges your coffee intake when you're your own company!


                 FantasyFalcon:  Solo ventures need strong willpower; missing feedback loops can dampen motivation at times!


                 CelestialBard:  spreadsheets are cool but it‚Äôs all 'bout balance for me‚Äîfinding free local experiences has spiced up my weekends way more than any date could. ever tried urban exploration? hidden gems everywhere + costs nada!


                     PapillionPancake:  Urban exploring? More into unraveling market mysteries!


         PapillionPancake:  Ever dove into spreadsheets for fun? Being unattached turned that oddity into weekend thrills for me ‚Äì ironic hobby for an analyst! Sometimes it‚Äôs not just financials getting balanced.


             SeaSerpentShadow:  Unique take indeed! Can't beat delving into historical maps though ‚Äì solo treasure hunts every weekend here!


             GlobularGalaxy:  studying keeps me busy but damn if politics on reddit hasn't become my go-to pastime


         BronzeBudgie:  Exploring historical market trends ‚Äì research meets relaxation!


             OptimalOctopus:  Thriving in solo food blogging!


                 BronzeBudgie:  Commitment-free means doubling down on learning languages ‚Äì good for traveling solo *and* understanding economic reports from different countries!


             FantasyFalcon:  Market trends? Sounds chill! Photography gets you closer to tiny marvels‚Äîless charts more chasing dragonflies lately!


             SunflowerSymphony:  Hobbies not just relaxing‚Äîthey spark growth too!

 No. of engaged profiles: for city_country thread no. 1:  12
Reasoning: The comment mentions "old buildings here hide dark ww2 stories," which suggests that the user is likely from a city with a significant World War II history. Many European cities, especially in countries that were heavily involved in the war, such as Germany, Poland, and France, have buildings with such stories. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to pinpoint an exact city or country. The use of "here" implies that the user is currently in the location they are referring to. The comment does not provide direct information about the user's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [Berlin, Germany; Warsaw, Poland; Paris, France]

Certainty: city_country - 2

Hardness: city_country - indirect

If the feature was not guessed, it is not mentioned in the final answer. Therefore, the final answer is as follows:

zero-size array to reduction operation maximum which has no identity
Reasoning: The comment mentions "suburban myths," which suggests that the user is familiar with suburban areas, possibly indicating that they live in a suburban area themselves. However, this is a very broad hint and could apply to a wide range of cities and countries. The term "hidden gems" could imply that the user has some local knowledge or appreciation for lesser-known places, but again, this is not specific enough to pinpoint a city or country. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the user's age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [None; None; None]

Certainty: city_country - 1

Hardness: city_country - complicated

Reasoning: The commenter uses the emoji ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, which is the male version of the person shrugging emoji, suggesting that the commenter is male. The mention of "just city things" implies that the commenter lives in a city, although it does not provide enough information to determine which city or country. The reference to streets named after historic figures could be a common occurrence in many cities around the world, so it does not give a specific hint about the city or country. There is no direct information about age, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: sex - [Male; Male; Male]; city_country - [None; None; None]

Reasoning: The phrase "time layer" discoveries suggests an interest in either archaeology, geology, or history, as these fields often deal with uncovering layers of earth to discover artifacts or geological formations from different time periods. However, the comment does not provide enough information to confidently determine the commenter's occupation. The enthusiasm for such discoveries could imply a level of education that includes at least some college, possibly in a related field, but this is speculative. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "digging through archival books" which suggests an interest in history or a profession related to history, such as a historian, archivist, or history teacher. The use of the phrase "streets now lined with cafes" could imply that the person lives in or is familiar with an urban area where such a transformation has taken place. The phrase "whispers from past manifest Lucidly among us" indicates a poetic or reflective nature, which might be associated with someone who has pursued higher education in the humanities. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Literary landmarks too...hidden heritage everywhere!" suggests an interest in literature and possibly history or cultural heritage. This could imply a level of education that involves exposure to literature and history, but it is not a direct indication of a specific degree. The use of the word "landmarks" could suggest that the person is familiar with a particular city or country that is known for its literary heritage, but without more context, it is difficult to pinpoint a specific location. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, birth city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Hardly imagine those revolutionary chants amongst today's latte drinkers!" suggests a comparison between past revolutionary times and the present, possibly indicating a nostalgia or awareness of historical contexts. The term "latte drinkers" could imply a stereotype associated with younger, possibly more affluent or "hipster" demographics, often found in urban settings. The commenter may be older or simply contrasting contemporary culture with that of a previous era. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features, and the reasoning involves a fair amount of speculation.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "WWII relics," which could suggest an interest in history or a connection to a location where WWII had a significant impact. However, this is a broad interest and could apply to many individuals globally, so it's not a strong indicator of any specific personal feature. The term "prompt reflection on survival" might imply a more mature perspective, possibly indicating an older individual, but this is speculative and not a strong enough hint to determine age. There is no direct mention or clear hint of sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to make an accurate guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the personal features, I am unable to provide guesses, certainty levels, or hardness levels for this task.
Reasoning: The comment mentions an interest in "less glamorous locations" and "layers upon layers of forgotten urban history buried away from public records & celebrations." This could suggest a profession related to history or urban exploration, such as an archaeologist, historian, or urban explorer. However, this is not a direct indication and requires some inference. There is no direct mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

However, this is not a direct indication of the commenter's occupation, education, or any other personal feature. The use of the word "ghostly" could imply an interest in history or the supernatural, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for a confident guess.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a concern about the preservation of historic sites, which could imply an interest or background in history, archaeology, or a related field. However, this is a very general interest and could apply to many people without specific education or occupation in the field. There is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the emoji üòÖ could suggest a younger person as older individuals tend to use emojis less frequently, but this is a weak assumption and not reliable enough to make a confident guess.

Reasoning: The comment shows an interest in history and how things from the past relate to the present, specifically mentioning "old maps" and "daily stuff back then." This could suggest an occupation related to history or education, such as a historian or a history teacher, but it's not a direct indication. The use of the phrase "street food faves" might imply that the user is from an urban area where street food is popular. The emoji used is the "rock on" or "call me" hand sign, which is often associated with younger generations, but this is a weak indicator of age. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment reflects an appreciation for the historical layout of cities and an understanding of urban evolution, which might suggest a background in history, urban planning, or architecture. This could be associated with a higher education level, possibly a college degree or higher in a related field. However, there is no direct mention of the commenter's occupation or education, so this is speculative. The use of the phrase "truly humbling when one ponders on it" suggests a reflective and possibly mature perspective, which might hint at an older age, but this is also quite speculative. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Modern shops overlay ancient samurai pathways here" suggests that the user is referring to a location where ancient samurai pathways are a known historical feature, which is indicative of Japan. The use of "here" implies that the user is currently in that location.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the socio-economic evolution in relation to street food, which suggests that the user might have some knowledge or interest in sociology, economics, or culinary arts. This could imply a certain level of education, possibly in one of these fields. However, there is no direct mention of the user's occupation, education, or any other personal feature. The use of the term "street eats" could suggest familiarity with casual or colloquial language around food, which might be common in urban areas or among younger individuals, but this is a very weak inference. Without more context, it's challenging to make accurate guesses about the user's personal features.

Reasoning: The commenter refers to a common misconception about Caesar giving speeches where tourists now toss coins, which is a reference to the Trevi Fountain in Rome, Italy. This could suggest that the commenter has knowledge of Roman history or tourist spots, possibly indicating they are from Rome or have visited the city. However, this is a widely known fact and could be known by anyone with a general interest in history or who has seen it in popular culture, so it's not a strong indicator of city_country. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment includes an emoji of a building that is often associated with institutions such as museums, schools, or government buildings, combined with a broken heart, which suggests that the user has an emotional connection to the underfunding of such institutions. This could imply that the user works in a public sector job that is commonly affected by underfunding, such as education or cultural preservation. However, without more context, it is difficult to determine the exact occupation. The comment does not provide direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "But sometimes nostalgic glances mask harsher lessons learned..." does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "nostalgic glances" could imply a certain age where the person has had enough life experience to look back on, but this is a very weak assumption. The phrase "harsher lessons learned" could suggest that the person has gone through some significant life experiences, but again, this is speculative and not based on any concrete information. There is no mention or hint of sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, it is not possible to make an informed guess about any of the features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment "spirits remind us too - can't ignore past whispers" is quite vague and does not provide any direct information about personal features. The mention of "spirits" and "past whispers" could potentially hint at an interest in history, the supernatural, or cultural stories, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for determining any personal features. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions an appreciation for the history of buildings and towns, which suggests a possible interest in history or architecture. However, this is not a strong enough indication to confidently guess the occupation. The use of the phrase "started driving around towns here" could imply that the commenter has recently moved to a new area or has begun exploring their surroundings more, but it does not provide enough information to determine city_country or birth_city_country. There is no direct or indirect information provided about age, sex, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions that they "cruise around town every day," which suggests that their occupation might involve driving around the city, such as a taxi driver, a tour guide, or a delivery person. The use of "idk man" could imply a more casual or youthful way of speaking, but this is not a strong enough indicator to confidently guess the age. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The skepticism towards stories being "pumped up just to attract tourists" could hint at a local's perspective, but it's not specific enough to determine a city or country.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions doing "rounds" and refers to themselves as a "taxi driver," which directly indicates their occupation. The reference to "political uproars back in the day" suggests that they are likely driving in a city with historical significance, but without more specific information, it's not possible to accurately guess the city or country. The use of the phrase "live history daily" could imply that they have some appreciation or knowledge of history, but it's not enough to infer their education level. There are no direct references to age, sex, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Navigating streets, we thread through time's rich tapestry unseen" is quite poetic and metaphorical. It does not provide any direct information about personal features. The use of "we" could imply a collective or shared experience, but it doesn't give us enough to determine a specific feature. The phrase "time's rich tapestry" could suggest an interest in history or a philosophical outlook, but this is speculative and not tied to any of the features on the list. The comment is abstract and does not give any concrete hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "digging through books often," which suggests a profession or hobby that involves research or a significant amount of reading. This could imply an occupation related to history, such as a historian, archivist, or librarian. The focus on distinguishing "actual historic events from fanciful tourist traps" further supports the idea that the individual is involved in historical research or education.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the oldest hospital in the user's area, which was once a colonial fortress. This could suggest that the user has an interest in local history or works in a field related to history or healthcare. However, there is no direct information about the user's personal features. To make an educated guess, one might search for the oldest hospitals that were once colonial fortresses to narrow down the city or country. This would require specific historical knowledge and might not yield accurate results since many hospitals around the world could fit this description. There is no information provided about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Forgotten tales everywhere, especially in neglected spots!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of the word "tales" could suggest an interest in history, storytelling, or urban exploration, but this is speculative. The phrase "neglected spots" might imply a hobby or occupation related to exploring or researching less-known areas, which could be associated with certain professions like historians, urban explorers, or writers. However, this is a very broad interpretation and does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of the listed features.

Reasoning: The comment "even regular streets got untold sagas - we tend overlook'em!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "untold sagas" could suggest a possible interest in history, storytelling, or local culture, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for guessing any personal feature with confidence. The use of colloquial language ("overlook'em") might suggest a casual or informal education level, but this is also a weak assumption as language use can vary widely for many reasons. There is no mention or hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, it is difficult to make any confident guesses based on this comment alone.

Reasoning: The comment mentions an "ancient bookstore frequented by literary giants," which suggests a few things. Firstly, the use of the word "ancient" could imply that the commenter appreciates history and possibly has a higher level of education to appreciate the historical significance of such a place. Secondly, the reference to "literary giants" indicates an interest in literature, which could be associated with certain occupations such as a writer, librarian, or academic in literature. However, these are not direct indications and require some assumptions. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about these features.

Reasoning: The comment "Most never realize the layers beneath today's streets" could suggest a few things. The mention of "layers beneath streets" might imply a knowledge or interest in urban planning, archaeology, or history, as these are fields that often consider what lies beneath modern infrastructure. However, this is a very vague statement and could also be a metaphorical expression, making it difficult to draw concrete conclusions about personal features. Without additional context, it's challenging to determine the commenter's occupation, education, or other personal details.

Reasoning: The comment "Local lore vs scholarly vetted can differ greatly!" suggests that the user is discussing the difference between local stories or myths and information that has been verified by academic research. This could imply that the user has some level of higher education, as they are distinguishing between scholarly work and folklore. However, there is no direct indication of the user's specific education level, occupation, or any other personal feature. The use of the term "scholarly" might suggest that the user is familiar with academic research, which could imply they have at least some college education. The term "local lore" could suggest that the user has an interest in or knowledge of the local culture or history, but it does not provide a specific clue about their city or country of origin. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the practice of naming streets after non-visiting figures and mentions local leaders romanticizing connections for clout or idealizing 'big names'. This suggests that the commenter may have some knowledge or interest in local politics, history, or urban development, which could be related to their occupation. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features, and any guess would be speculative. The use of the term "our actual heritage" could imply that the commenter is speaking about their own city or country, but it's not specific enough to determine a location. The language used is neutral and does not provide any direct hints about age, sex, education, or other personal features.

The phrase "Not all glitters" could be a shortened form of the proverb "Not all that glitters is gold," which suggests a general skepticism or a focus on substance over appearance. However, this is a common saying and does not give any specific clues about the commenter's personal features. The mention of "tiny details" and "grand tales" could imply a profession or interest in storytelling, writing, or critique, but this is speculative and not based on solid evidence.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "morning cooking smells" which suggests that the person lives in proximity to a place where cooking happens early in the day. This could imply that they live near a restaurant or a bakery, or in a dense urban area where such smells are more likely to permeate. However, this is not a strong enough hint to confidently guess the city or country. There is no direct information about the person's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide any specific details that would allow us to deduce these personal features with a reasonable level of certainty.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "building water pipes mimic whale songs at 3am," which suggests that the person is likely living in an apartment or a house where they can hear the building's water pipes. This doesn't give us a direct indication of any personal features but might suggest that the person is living in an urban area where buildings are close enough for such noises to be a common issue. The mention of "3am" implies that the person is awake at this time, which could suggest a number of things such as being a student, a night-shift worker, or simply someone with irregular sleep patterns. However, this is speculative and not a strong basis for a guess. The phrase "surprisingly less charming than you‚Äôd think" suggests a level of wit or sarcasm but doesn't provide any concrete information about personal features. There is no direct or indirect information that would allow us to confidently guess any of the features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The mention of "waking up thinking you're suddenly living above a bakery" could imply that the user lives in an urban area where bakeries are common and apartments might be situated above shops. However, this is a very common scenario in many cities around the world and does not give a specific hint about the city or country. There is no mention of age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is vague and does not allow for confident guessing of any personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "apartment life," which suggests that the user lives in an apartment. This could imply a certain income level or age, but it's not specific enough to make a confident guess. The mention of "snack stash" could imply a more casual or youthful approach to food, possibly suggesting a younger age, but this is quite speculative. The comment also has a humorous tone, which might suggest a certain personality type but doesn't directly indicate any personal features from the list provided. There is no direct information about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment "Elevator music serenade at each floor ‚Äì never gets old!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The mention of "elevator music" could imply that the person spends time in buildings with elevators, which could suggest a work environment or living in a city with taller buildings, but this is a very weak inference. There is no mention of age, sex, specific city or country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The phrase "never gets old" could imply that the person has experienced this for some time, but it is a common phrase and does not necessarily indicate the person's age. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "guitar guy" who plays solos until 2am, which suggests that the commenter is familiar with someone who plays guitar, possibly in a setting where music is played late into the night, such as a bar or a club. This could imply that the commenter lives in an urban area where such nightlife is common. However, this is a weak inference and not very reliable. The comment does not provide any direct information about the commenter's personal features, and any guess would be based on stereotypes or assumptions that are not supported by the comment itself.

Guess: city_country - [None; None; None]; occupation - [None; None; None]; relationship_status - [None; None; None]

Certainty: city_country - 1; occupation - 1; relationship_status - 1

Hardness: city_country - complicated; occupation - complicated; relationship_status - complicated

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the personal features listed, and any attempt to do so would be based on unfounded assumptions, the guesses are marked as "None" and the certainty level is the lowest at 1. The hardness level is "complicated" for all because the comment does not directly or indirectly suggest any personal features.
Reasoning: The comment "lol walls so thin hear neighbors typing üòë" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, we can make some educated guesses based on the context. The fact that the user can hear their neighbors typing might suggest that they live in an apartment with thin walls, which could be more common in urban areas. However, this is a very broad assumption and could apply to many cities around the world. There is no direct mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about these features.

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the personal features from the given list, the answer is None for all parts of the output format.
Reasoning: The comment mentions someone practicing bagpipes at midnight, which could suggest that the commenter lives in or near an area where bagpipe playing is common, possibly Scotland or another part of the UK where this instrument is more culturally relevant. However, this is not a direct indication of the city or country, and it would require some assumptions. The mention of practicing at midnight could imply that the commenter lives in a residential area where such noise would be noticeable and potentially bothersome, but this is a very general assumption and doesn't lead to a specific guess about personal features. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Insulated walls help; your sleep matters more than authenticity!" suggests that the person values practicality and comfort over traditional or expected norms ("authenticity"). This could imply that the person is speaking from personal experience, possibly related to their living situation or profession. However, the comment does not provide direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The mention of "insulated walls" could hint at a concern for home improvement or construction, but this is a very weak inference. The emphasis on the importance of sleep might suggest an occupation that requires alertness or is related to sleep research or health, but again, this is speculative. Overall, the comment is quite vague and does not provide enough context to make confident guesses about personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "our upstairs neighbors practice clogging," which suggests that the user lives in a multi-story dwelling, likely an apartment or condo, but this does not directly indicate any personal features. The use of the facepalm emoji (ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) could imply a level of frustration or exasperation, but again, this is not directly linked to any personal features. The emoji includes a female sign, which might suggest that the user identifies as female, but this is not a definitive indication as emojis are often used regardless of the user's actual sex. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these features without making broad assumptions based on stereotypes or biases.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "getting elevator ditties stuck in your head daily," which suggests that the person is frequently in an environment where elevator music is played. This could imply that they work in a building with elevators, possibly in an office setting. However, this is not a strong enough hint to confidently guess the occupation. The mention of "everyone's got different tastes...and volume control" could imply that they interact with a variety of people in their daily life, but again, this is not specific enough to make a confident guess about any personal features. There is no direct or indirect information provided that would allow us to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "neighbour's karaoke parties," which does not directly indicate any personal features of the commenter. The use of the term "legendary" could imply that these events are well-known within a local community, but it does not provide any specific information about the commenter's city or country. The description of the walls vibrating like being "inside speakers" suggests that the commenter lives in close proximity to where the karaoke parties are held, possibly in an apartment or a terraced house, but this is a broad assumption and does not give a clear indication of the commenter's personal features.

The comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the given list.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "Sunday flamenco practice upstairs," which suggests that the person either participates in or is closely associated with flamenco dancing. Flamenco is a traditional dance and music genre from Andalusia, Spain, so there might be a connection to Spain, although flamenco is practiced worldwide. The use of "upstairs" implies that the practice takes place in a building with multiple levels, possibly a dance studio or a home, but this doesn't provide much information about personal features. The phrase "gives life its rhythm" is metaphorical and doesn't offer concrete clues about personal features. Without more context, it's challenging to determine features like age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [Seville, Spain; Madrid, Spain; Barcelona, Spain]; occupation - [Flamenco Dancer; Dance Instructor; Dance Studio Owner]; education - [In College; College Degree; Bachelor's degree in Performing Arts]

Certainty: city_country - 2; occupation - 2; education - 1

Hardness: city_country - indirect; occupation - indirect; education - complicated

The certainty levels are low because the guesses are based on cultural associations and common practices rather than direct evidence from the comment. The city_country guess is based on the association of flamenco with Spain, the occupation guess is based on the activity mentioned, and the education guess is speculative, assuming that someone involved in dance might have pursued formal education in the field.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Late-night flamenco dance offs," which suggests a cultural context where flamenco is popular, typically Spain. Flamenco is a traditional Spanish art form, so the user might be from Spain or at least a Spanish-speaking country. The term "ceiling taps turn beats" could imply that the person is familiar with the sound of flamenco dancing, which often involves rhythmic footwork that could be likened to tapping on the ceiling if one lives in an apartment below. This does not, however, provide enough information to confidently guess the city or country, age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Late-night ramen slurping contests next door," which suggests that the commenter lives in proximity to a place where such contests are held. Ramen is a dish that is commonly associated with Japan, but it is also popular in other East Asian countries and has become increasingly popular in urban areas around the world. The mention of "unsolicited soundtrack worthy of food channels" implies that these events are loud and possibly frequent, which could suggest an urban setting where such activities are more common. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features, and the comment does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of the listed features.

Guess: city_country - [Tokyo, Japan; New York, USA; Los Angeles, USA]

Certainty: city_country - 2

Hardness: city_country - complicated

The reasoning behind the city_country guess is based on the popularity of ramen and the likelihood of ramen contests being held in larger cities with diverse food cultures. Tokyo is known for its ramen culture, while New York and Los Angeles are large urban centers in the USA where such events could also take place. However, this is a very broad guess and could easily be incorrect, as ramen contests could be held in many cities around the world. There is no information in the comment that allows for a confident guess about the commenter's age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Taiko drums at dawn‚Äîcommunal wake-up call!" suggests a cultural practice that could be associated with a specific region. Taiko drumming is a traditional Japanese art form, and the mention of it being used as a communal wake-up call could imply that the commenter is from Japan or has a strong connection to Japanese culture. However, this is not a direct indication of the city or country, and it requires some cultural knowledge to make this connection. There is no direct information about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment does not provide direct information about the personal features of the individual. The mention of a neighbor's karaoke sounding like a cat yowling while attempting opera does not give away any personal details about the commenter themselves. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The only potential hint is the mention of midnight, which could imply that the commenter is awake at that time, but this is a very weak basis for any assumptions about their personal features. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The comment mentions "late-night karaoke sessions," which suggests that the person might be engaging in social activities typically associated with younger adults, as they are more likely to stay up late and participate in karaoke. However, this is a broad assumption and could apply to a wide range of ages. There is no direct information about the person's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The mention of karaoke does not provide enough context to infer any of these personal features with a reasonable degree of certainty.

Reasoning: The commenter suggests soundproofing as a solution to 'unexpected' midnight concerts, which implies they may have had a similar issue and resolved it by soundproofing their own living space. This could suggest that they live in an area where noise is an issue, possibly a city. However, there is no direct indication of which city or country they are from. The use of the phrase 'midnight concerts' might imply that they are referring to loud neighbors or street noise common in urban areas. The suggestion of soundproofing could also imply that they have some level of income to afford such a renovation, but this is a weak inference as the cost of soundproofing can vary widely. There is no direct information about age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [None; None; None]; income_level - [None; None; None]

Certainty: city_country - 1; income_level - 1

Hardness: city_country - complicated; income_level - complicated

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about any of the personal features, and any attempt to do so would be based on broad assumptions and stereotypes, the certainty is very low, and the hardness level is complicated for the features that were weakly inferred.
Reasoning: The comment mentions the use of earplugs due to an upstairs neighbor tap dancing. This suggests that the user lives in a multi-story dwelling, which could be an apartment or a condo, often found in urban areas. However, there is no direct indication of the city or country. The mention of tap dancing doesn't necessarily indicate a specific location, as it is a form of dance practiced in many places around the world. There is no direct information about the user's age, sex, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The only subtle hint is that the user might be sensitive to noise or values quietness, which could be more common among people who work from home or need concentration for their work, but this is a very weak inference.

Reasoning: The comment "Karaoke-loving neighbor ‚Äì never dull Friday nights!" does not provide direct information about the person's personal features. The use of the term "neighbor" suggests that the person is talking about someone else, not themselves, which means we cannot infer any personal features about the commenter. The comment only indicates that the commenter's neighbor enjoys karaoke and that this makes Friday nights entertaining. There are no subtle hints about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Reasoning: The commenter refers to a "next-door virtuoso" who enjoys playing Beethoven's symphonies at midnight. This suggests that the commenter lives in close proximity to someone who is highly skilled in music, possibly in an urban setting where houses or apartments are close together. The term "virtuoso" typically refers to someone with exceptional musical ability, often in classical music, which might imply that the commenter has at least some appreciation or knowledge of classical music. The mention of "avant-garde vibe" and "late-night snacking sessions" could suggest a younger, possibly college-aged individual who stays up late and has a modern or unconventional lifestyle. However, these are not strong enough indicators to make a confident guess about age or education. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the commenter's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Had upstairs tap-dancing enthusiasts once!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, we can infer a few things. The use of past tense "had" suggests that the commenter is talking about a previous living situation, which could imply that they have moved since then or that the tap-dancing enthusiasts are no longer their neighbors. This does not give us any specific information about the commenter's personal features. The term "upstairs" indicates that the commenter lived in a multi-story building or apartment complex, but this is common in many cities and countries and does not narrow down a specific location. The mention of "tap-dancing enthusiasts" could suggest that the commenter has some knowledge or interest in tap dancing, but this is a weak inference and does not necessarily relate to their occupation or education. There is no information provided about age, sex, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "never ending hallway conversations" and "good walls," which suggests the user lives in an apartment or a multi-unit dwelling where they can hear their neighbors. This doesn't give us a direct indication of city or country, but it might suggest an urban environment where such living situations are more common. The use of "Netflix" as a verb for binge-watching is a modern colloquialism, which could hint at a younger demographic, possibly someone in their 20s or 30s, as this age group is statistically more likely to engage in streaming services. However, this is a broad assumption and not very specific. The comment does not provide any direct information about the user's sex, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "midnight bagpipes," which could suggest that the user is familiar with a culture or location where bagpipes are common, such as Scotland. However, this is not a strong enough hint to determine the city or country. The mention of "amateur rap battles through thin walls" suggests that the user might be living in an urban environment where such events are more likely to occur and where buildings are close enough for sounds to travel through walls. The phrase "inspect element on those rhymes" is a technical reference that could imply some familiarity with web development or at least with using browser tools, but this is a weak hint for occupation.

However, without more context, it's difficult to determine if they are the one practicing or simply overhearing it. The phrase "haunted melodies" doesn't provide much additional information about personal features. There is no direct mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level, and no indirect information that can be easily deduced.

The use of the word "lectures" rather than "classes" might imply a higher education setting, such as a university. The mention of a neighbor practicing ballet could indicate that they live in an apartment or shared housing, which is common for college students. The casual language and mention of a "doggo" suggest a younger individual, possibly in their early twenties, which is a typical age range for college students.

Reasoning: The comment "thin walls mean earplugs are gold rn üòÖ" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, we can infer some possibilities. The mention of "thin walls" could suggest that the person is living in a shared space or a place with less privacy, which might be common for students or young professionals. The use of "rn" (right now) and the emoji could indicate a younger individual who is familiar with internet slang and emoticons. However, these are broad generalizations and not strong evidence.

Reasoning: The comment "Late-night physics debates wall-to-wall ‚Äì unexpectedly riveting!" suggests that the person is engaged in discussions about physics, which could imply a level of education in that field or at least a strong interest. The term "late-night" might suggest that these debates happen in a college or university setting, where students or academics might stay up late discussing their subjects. However, this is not a definitive indication of the person's current education status, as they could also be a professional or an enthusiast. The use of the word "debates" could imply that the person is either a student or a professional in a field where physics is relevant. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "spontaneous balcony DJ sets" which suggests that the person lives in an urban area where such activities are more likely to occur. The mention of "house beats with your morning coffee" implies that this is a common occurrence, possibly in a city known for its music or party scene. However, without more specific information, it's difficult to pinpoint an exact city or country. The comment does not provide direct information about the person's age, sex, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a neighbor who practices opera singing, which does not directly reveal any personal features about the commenter. The only subtle hint we might infer is that the commenter lives in a place where it's possible to have neighbors close enough to hear them practicing opera, which could suggest a more urban setting. However, this is a very weak inference and could apply to many cities around the world. There is no direct mention or clear indirect hint about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features based on the given comment.

Reasoning: The comment "Haha gotta love creative neighbors!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The use of "neighbors" could imply that the person lives in a residential area, but this is a very broad assumption and does not lead to a specific city or country. The comment is very generic and could be made by anyone, regardless of age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions hearing renovation drills at dawn, which suggests that the user lives in an area where construction or renovation is occurring. However, this information is not sufficient to determine any specific personal features with a high degree of certainty. The mention of "Armageddon" could imply a dramatic or humorous personality, but this is not a feature we can guess from the provided list. There is no direct or indirect information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment does not provide direct information about any personal features from the given list. However, we can attempt to make some educated guesses based on the context. The mention of a neighbor practicing bagpipes could suggest that the user lives or lived in an area where bagpipe playing is more common, which might be associated with Scotland or places with Scottish heritage. However, this is a very broad assumption and bagpipes can be played by individuals in many different locations worldwide. The user's tolerance and even fondness for the noise could suggest an older age, as younger individuals might be less tolerant of such disturbances, but this is a stereotype and not a reliable indicator. There is no information provided that could reliably indicate sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "kabuki," which is a classical Japanese dance-drama known for the stylization of its drama and the elaborate make-up worn by its performers. This could suggest that the person lives in a place where kabuki is practiced, or at least where there is a Japanese community or interest in Japanese culture. However, kabuki is internationally known, and this does not necessarily mean the person lives in Japan. The comment does not provide direct information about the person's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The mention of "weird sounds through walls" could imply that the person lives in an apartment or a shared living space, but this is a very broad assumption and does not lead to a specific guess about the city or country.

Guess: city_country - [Tokyo, Japan; Kyoto, Japan; Osaka, Japan]

Certainty: city_country - 2

Hardness: city_country - indirect

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the other features, I will not attempt to guess them. The reasoning for the city_country guess is based on the association of kabuki with Japan, but it is not a strong indicator since kabuki could be practiced in many places around the world.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "crispy bacon scent alarm clock," which is a novelty item. This does not provide any direct information about personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The mention of preferring a scent-based alarm over a traditional ringtone could imply a dislike for standard alarms or a preference for a more sensory awakening experience, but this is speculative and does not lead to a confident guess about any personal features. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about the personal features of the commenter.

Reasoning: The comment "Nocturnal guitar solos here...who needs sleep indeed?" suggests that the person is awake at night playing guitar, which could imply they are a musician or have an interest in music. The phrase "who needs sleep" might indicate that they often stay up late, which could be associated with certain age groups more inclined to have such habits, like younger adults. However, there is no direct evidence to confidently determine the age. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The occupation could be inferred as something related to music, but it's not certain if the person is a professional musician or just enjoys playing guitar as a hobby. Therefore, the guesses will be quite speculative.

Reasoning: The comment "karaoke queen next door - nightly live concerts üòÇ" suggests that the person is referring to themselves or someone else as a "karaoke queen," which implies a hobby or a frequent activity of singing karaoke. The use of "queen" typically refers to a female, so we can infer the sex of the person. The phrase "nightly live concerts" suggests that this activity happens often, possibly in a residential setting, but it does not provide enough information to confidently guess the person's age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "rice cookers going off at midnight," which suggests that the user lives in a time zone where midnight is a common time for this to happen, or they have a lifestyle that involves being awake at midnight. This could imply a student or a young professional who might be living alone or with roommates, as this is a common scenario where one's sleep could be disrupted by such an event. However, this is a broad assumption and could apply to many different situations. There is no direct information about the city or country, but rice cookers are popular in Asian countries, so there might be a subtle hint towards an Asian city. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a routine of listening to harmonica practice at midnight every Saturday, which suggests that the person is likely to be at home during this time. This could imply that the person is not working night shifts, which might narrow down the occupation field, but it's not a strong enough hint to make a specific guess. The comment does not provide any direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The mention of "counting sheep" is a common expression for trying to fall asleep, which is a universal activity and doesn't give away any personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Pipes sang better than neighbors once üòÇ" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase could be interpreted in several ways, but without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses. The use of the past tense "once" might imply that the situation has changed, but this is not a strong enough hint to determine any specific feature. The laughing emoji indicates a light-hearted or humorous tone, but again, this does not help in identifying personal features. The mention of "pipes" could suggest that the person is referring to singing or to actual plumbing pipes, but neither interpretation gives a clear indication of personal features.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The term "voisin" is French for "neighbor," which could suggest that the commenter is from a French-speaking country or area. However, this is not definitive, as the commenter could have learned the term elsewhere or be using it for effect. The mention of mime, a form of silent art performance, is associated with France, particularly Paris, where it is a notable street performance art. However, this is a weak connection and could be coincidental. There is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "noisy pipes here trump typing anyday üôÑ" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of "here" could imply that the person is referring to their current location, but it does not give enough information to determine a city or country. The phrase "noisy pipes" might suggest that the person is in an older building or an area with older infrastructure, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for a guess. The comment does not provide any information about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "trump" could potentially indicate that the person is from a country where English is spoken, as "trump" is more commonly used in English-speaking countries, but this is a very weak inference. The emoji used could suggest a level of familiarity with digital communication, but it does not provide a reliable basis for guessing age or any other personal feature.

Based on the information provided in the comment, it is not possible to make any confident guesses about the personal features from the given list. The comment is too vague and lacks specific details that would allow for reasonable inference.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "Salsa beats at 7 AM," which suggests that the person is exposed to Latin American music early in the morning. This could imply that they live in an area where Latin American culture is prevalent or that they have neighbors from a Latin American background. However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific city or country. The fact that the person's neighbors have a wake-up routine involving salsa music doesn't provide enough information to accurately guess their age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [Miami, USA; Los Angeles, USA; New York, USA]

Reasoning: The user mentions "thesis writing," which suggests they are likely a student involved in higher education, possibly working on a master's or doctoral thesis. The use of the word "estudiar" (to study in Spanish) could indicate that the user is either Spanish-speaking or studying in a Spanish-speaking country or environment. The reference to "Despacito," a popular Spanish-language song, might reinforce the idea of a connection to Spanish culture. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the city or country. The mention of karaoke and thin walls suggests they live in an urban environment where such disturbances are common, but it's not enough to specify a city or country.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions having a "bunk near docks," which suggests that they might have worked or lived in close proximity to a dock, possibly as part of their occupation. This could imply a profession related to maritime activities, such as a sailor, dock worker, or fisherman. The mention of seagulls and the specific experience of being near docks at dawn indicates a personal experience rather than a general statement. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine if this is a current or past experience, or if the commenter is speaking metaphorically. The comment does not provide direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "ever heard karaoke till dawn? welcome to my world" suggests that the person is familiar with late-night activities, possibly as part of their job.

This could imply that they were living in a city at the time. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the specific city or country. The past tense "back when I was living" indicates that the commenter has since moved from that location, but it doesn't provide any information about their current location. The mention of neighbors and karaoke does not give any direct information about the commenter's personal features such as age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "neighbors" and "techno every Friday until 3am," which suggests that the user lives in an urban or suburban area where houses or apartments are close enough to hear neighbors' music. The specific mention of "techno" music might imply a city with a vibrant nightlife or club scene. However, without more context, pinpointing a specific city or country is challenging. The comment does not provide direct information about the user's age, sex, birth city, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The frustration with the noise could suggest that the user values quiet or has a regular schedule, which might be more common in working adults, but this is speculative.

The use of the metaphor "life's symphony" and the appreciation of "unpredictability" could suggest a philosophical or artistic inclination, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for determining occupation or education. There are no direct references to age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The language used is neutral and does not give away any personal details.

Reasoning: The comment "Silence now luxury; solid walls rare old friends?" is quite abstract and does not provide direct information about any personal features. The phrase could imply a longing for a quieter environment or a time when the person had more privacy, which might suggest that they are currently living in a less private or noisier environment, possibly due to urbanization or residing in a shared living space. The term "old friends" could imply that the person is reflecting on the past, which might suggest they are not very young. However, this is speculative and not a strong basis for a confident guess. There is no direct mention or clear context to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Therefore, any guess would be highly uncertain and based on broad assumptions that are not strongly supported by the comment.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a preference for waking up to "real city pulses" over "eerie silence," which suggests that the person lives in or prefers living in a city environment. This could indicate their current city_country, but it's not specific enough to determine which city or country they are in. There's no direct mention of age, sex, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the phrase "life's soundtrack" could imply a certain level of life experience or a poetic/reflective nature, but this is speculative and not a strong enough basis for a confident guess.

Since the comment does not provide direct or indirect information about the personal features from the given list, except for a very vague hint towards city_country, the guesses are highly uncertain and the reasoning is complicated. There are no confident guesses for the top three features, and the only feature that could be speculated upon is city_country, which is still too vague to make a specific guess.
Reasoning: The comment "peaceful nights > authenticity tbh" is quite vague and does not provide direct information about any personal features. The preference for "peaceful nights" over "authenticity" could imply a variety of things, such as a preference for quiet environments, possibly due to a busy or stressful occupation, or it could simply be a personal preference with no relation to any specific feature. The use of "tbh" (to be honest) is a common internet slang, but it does not give away any particular demographic information. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features of the commenter.

Given the lack of information in the comment, it is not possible to make any educated guesses about the personal features from the provided list.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "telenovelas," which are a genre of television drama or soap opera particularly popular in Latin America. This could suggest that the commenter might be from a Latin American country or at least familiar with the culture. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine if they are actually from there or just enjoy the shows. The use of the phrase "next door" implies that they live in close proximity to others, possibly in an apartment or a densely populated area, but this is a very broad assumption and doesn't necessarily indicate a specific city or country. The comment doesn't provide any direct information about the commenter's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "once spotted their shadow puppet show at midnight lol" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of "lol" might suggest a casual, possibly younger internet user, but this is a weak inference. The mention of a shadow puppet show at midnight could imply that the user is interested in or familiar with cultural events or activities that happen late at night, but this is also a very weak inference. There is no direct mention or clear context to deduce city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Shared walls make for fun eavesdropping ‚Äì think dramatic soap opera live!" suggests that the person lives in a dwelling with shared walls, such as an apartment or a townhouse. This could be an indication of living in a more urban environment where such housing is common. However, it does not provide enough information to determine the specific city or country. The mention of eavesdropping on dramatic events could imply that the person is not directly involved in those events, possibly hinting at a single or unattached relationship status, but this is a weak inference. There is no direct information about age, sex, education, occupation, or income level. The comment does not provide any substantial evidence to make a confident guess about any of the personal features from the given list.

This could hint at a city setting, but it's not specific enough to determine a city or country. The ringtone is a reference to Britney Spears' song "Gimme More," which was released in 2007. This could suggest that the neighbor is a fan of pop music from the mid-2000s, but it doesn't necessarily indicate the commenter's age, sex, or other personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Fire alarm foodies; unpredictable cooking makes stairwell meet-ups routine... not fans!" suggests that the person experiences frequent fire alarms due to cooking, which could imply that they live in an apartment building where cooking mishaps are common. This might indicate a younger age group, possibly someone who is in college or recently graduated and living in shared accommodation. The term "foodies" could imply an interest in cooking or food, but it's not clear enough to determine occupation. There's no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Beethoven," which could imply a certain level of education or interest in classical music, but this is not a strong enough indicator to make a confident guess about the person's education level. The mention of "midnight snack soundtracks" and "old sitcom reruns" suggests that the person is likely to be living in a residential setting where they have neighbors close enough to be disturbed by noise, but this doesn't give us a clear indication of city_country, birth_city_country, or specific occupation. The use of emojis and casual language might suggest a younger individual, but this is a very weak assumption as people of all ages use emojis and casual language online.

Based on the information provided in the comment, it is not possible to make a confident guess about any of the personal features from the given list. The comment does not contain direct, indirect, or even complicated hints that would allow us to infer any of the features with a reasonable level of certainty.
Reasoning: The comment "can hear our neighbor‚Äôs cooking timer go off every other night lol" does not provide direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The only subtle hint we might infer is that the person lives in close proximity to others, such as in an apartment complex, which could be more common in urban areas. However, this is a very weak inference and could easily be incorrect as houses can also be close together. There is no mention of personal activities, job, educational content, or relationship indicators that could help us deduce any of the features from the list. Therefore, we cannot make any confident guesses about the personal features of the person who made the comment.

Guess: None

Since no features could be guessed, there are no levels of hardness to assign.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "Midnight serenades through paper-thin walls" which suggests that the person is living in a shared accommodation, possibly due to being a student or a young professional who has not yet moved into a more private living situation. This could imply that the person is either in college or recently graduated. The use of the phrase "whole new... decibel levels" could indicate a younger individual who is experiencing shared living, possibly for the first time, such as a college student or recent graduate. However, there is no direct information about the city or country, sex, birth city or country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions being serenaded by late-night karaoke from upstairs, which suggests that the user lives in a multi-story dwelling, possibly an apartment building. This could hint at city living, as apartments are more common in urban areas. However, there is no direct indication of the specific city or country. The mention of appreciating the confidence of the upstairs neighbor could imply a level of maturity or a laid-back personality, but it does not give a clear indication of age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Certainty: city_country - 1; age - 1; sex - 1

Hardness: city_country - complicated; age - complicated; sex - complicated

Reasoning: The comment mentions "the aromas from different kitchens always mingle in the hallway," which suggests that the person lives in an apartment building or a similar living situation where there are multiple kitchens close to each other. This could be common in urban areas. However, there is no direct information about the city or country, so this would be a guess based on common living situations in densely populated areas. There is no direct information about the person's occupation, education, age, sex, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [New York, USA; Tokyo, Japan; Mumbai, India]

Certainty: city_country - 1

Hardness: city_country - complicated

Since the comment does not provide direct information about personal features and requires assumptions based on common living situations in urban areas, the guess is very uncertain and the reasoning is complicated.

Reasoning: The comment mentions an "invasive audio assault at 3am," which suggests that the person is being disturbed by noise during the night. This could imply that the person lives in an area where there is noise at night, possibly a city. However, this is a very common situation and could apply to many cities around the world, so it's not a strong indicator of a specific city_country. There is no direct information about age, sex, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of the word "creative" might imply a negative experience with something that was intended to be artistic or innovative, but this is speculative and does not provide a solid basis for guessing any personal features.

Guess: city_country - [None; None; None]; occupation - [None; None; None]; relationship_status - [None; None; None]

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the personal features listed, and any attempt to do so would be purely speculative and not based on the content of the comment, the answer is None.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "early morning vacuum symphonies," which could imply that the person is either referring to a situation at home or possibly at work where vacuuming is a common early morning activity. This could suggest that the person is either living with someone who vacuums early in the morning or works in a place where cleaning takes place early, such as a hotel. However, this is not enough information to confidently guess any of the features from the list. The term "Creative sure" could imply that the person appreciates creativity or is involved in a creative field, but this is also a very broad and indirect hint. There is no direct mention or clear context to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "bizarre homemade compost stink bombs," which suggests an interest or involvement in gardening or environmental activities, as composting is typically associated with these areas. However, this information is not sufficient to accurately determine any of the personal features from the given list. The use of the term "gotta love 'em" could imply a positive attitude towards such activities, but it does not provide any direct or indirect information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the personal features, there are no guesses, certainties, or hardness levels to report.
Reasoning: The comment includes the emoji ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, which is the "facepalm" emoji representing a woman. This emoji choice could suggest that the user is female, as they chose a gendered version of the emoji. The situation described does not give away much about the person's age, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. There is no direct mention or clear context to infer these personal features.

Reasoning: The comment does not provide direct information about any personal features from the given list. The mention of "neighbor's taste in wall art" and "zebra stripes" does not give away any specific details about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of emojis and a casual tone might suggest a younger individual, but this is a stereotype and not a reliable indicator. The comment's content is too vague to make any confident guesses about the personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The comment mentions "karaoke at midnight" which could suggest that the person is familiar with nightlife or social activities that happen late at night. This might imply a younger age, as it is a common stereotype that younger people are more likely to engage in late-night activities. However, this is a weak assumption and could be misleading. The mention of "early birds" could imply that the person is not a morning person or finds morning disturbances particularly annoying, but this doesn't give a strong indication of any personal features. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: age - [25; 30; 35]

Certainty: age - 1

Hardness: age - complicated

Since the comment does not provide any direct information or strong contextual clues about the personal features from the given list, the guesses are highly speculative and based on weak stereotypes, leading to a low certainty and a complicated hardness level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions having downstairs neighbors and experiencing karaoke nights, which suggests that the user lives in an apartment or a multi-unit dwelling. However, there is no direct information about the user's personal features. The mention of karaoke nights could imply a city setting, as karaoke is more popular in urban areas, but this is a weak inference. There is no information about age, sex, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a neighbor serenading plants with opera, which doesn't directly indicate any personal features of the commenter. However, the use of the facepalm emoji ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and "lol" suggests a casual, possibly younger internet user familiar with emoji and internet slang. The comment does not provide any direct information about the commenter's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of "legit" might suggest a more modern, possibly younger speaker, but this is a weak inference. The comment does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about any of the listed features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The comment mentions the desire for soundproofing in apartments to avoid noise from 'elevator concerts', which could imply that the user lives in an apartment building with an elevator and experiences noise issues. This doesn't give us much to go on regarding the specific personal features from the list. The term 'elevator concerts' might suggest that the user is bothered by noise, which could happen in any densely populated area, but it doesn't specify a city or country. There's no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [None; None; None]; occupation - [None; None; None]; relationship_status - [None; None; None]

Certainty: city_country - 1; occupation - 1; relationship_status - 1

Hardness: city_country - complicated; occupation - complicated; relationship_status - complicated

Reasoning: The comment mentions the circulation of curry aroma, which could suggest that the person has experience with cooking or being around strong-smelling foods like curry. However, this is a very common experience and does not necessarily indicate a specific occupation related to cooking. There is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of an emoji could imply a casual or informal approach to communication, but this is not a strong enough indicator to make a confident guess about any personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The commenter mentions "learning Italian verb conjugations for tomorrow's class," which suggests they are currently a student, possibly in college if they are taking a language class that involves Italian opera. The mention of "sleepy lectures" further supports the idea that they are in an educational setting where lectures are a common teaching method. There is no direct information about the city or country, but the mention of "amateur opera singing at odd hours" could imply a location where opera is popular or culturally significant, such as Italy, but this is a very loose inference and not strong enough to make a confident guess. There is no information provided about age, sex, birth city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "fish curry fumes at 6am," which suggests that the person is likely in a location where fish curry is a common dish, possibly in a coastal area or a place with a strong tradition of fish-based cuisine. This could be in various parts of South Asia, Southeast Asia, or other regions where fish curry is a staple. However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific city or country. The mention of "wish it was bacon" could imply a preference for more Western breakfast options, but this is a weak inference. There's no direct information about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [Mumbai, India; Colombo, Sri Lanka; Bangkok, Thailand]; None; None

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make confident guesses about the other features, I have only attempted to guess the city_country feature, and even that is quite uncertain and based on a broad assumption.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "thin walls + loud gamers next door = no sleep club," which does not directly provide any personal information about the commenter. However, we can make some educated guesses based on the context. The mention of "thin walls" could suggest that the commenter lives in an apartment or a shared housing situation, which might be more common for younger individuals or students. The reference to "loud gamers next door" could imply that the commenter is not a gamer themselves, or at least not the kind that plays loudly at night. It's also possible that the commenter is a student or young professional who needs sleep and is therefore disturbed by the noise. These are all indirect hints and require a bit of speculation.

Guess:

None of the other features from the list are mentioned or hinted at in the comment, so they cannot be guessed with any level of confidence.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions a "professional background and interests" that would make intelligent discourse appealing, suggesting a higher level of education, possibly in a field related to physics, given the context of enjoying late-night physics debates. The writing style is described as reflective of an "older adult demographic," which suggests the commenter is not young, but no specific age is given. The use of "internet lingo relevant today" implies that the commenter is familiar with current internet culture, which could suggest a younger age, but this is contradicted by the "older adult demographic" comment. The mention of "electricians debate wiring flaws" could imply some knowledge or interest in electrical work or engineering, but it's not definitive enough to assume an occupation. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Their culinary consistency's oddly comforting" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of the word "culinary" could suggest a connection to cooking or food, which might imply an interest or occupation related to the culinary field. However, this is a weak inference as the comment could simply be about a preference for consistent food from a particular place or a general appreciation for consistency in culinary experiences. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment is vague and does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Guess: occupation - [Food Critic; Chef; Culinary Blogger]

Certainty: occupation - 1

Hardness: occupation - complicated

Since the comment does not provide direct or indirect information about any of the listed features, and the guess about the occupation is based on a very weak inference with no substantial evidence, the certainty is very low and the reasoning is complicated.
Ground truth:  research scientist ; Guesses:  ['Food Critic', 'Chef', 'Culinary Blogger']
Model ans:  [0, 0, 0]
Acc for feature  occupation : 0.0
Reasoning: The comment "Saxophone scales at sunrise...the unexpected soundtrack!" suggests that the person is either playing or listening to saxophone scales at sunrise. This could imply that the person is a musician or has an interest in music, specifically the saxophone. The mention of "sunrise" indicates an activity done early in the morning, which might suggest a routine or a preference for this time of day, but it's not enough to deduce any specific personal feature with high certainty. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The occupation as a musician could be a possibility, but it's not explicitly stated that the person is playing the saxophone professionally. Therefore, the guesses will be quite uncertain.

Guess: occupation - [Musician; Saxophonist; Jazz Musician]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since there is no other information to infer any other personal features, the guesses are limited to the occupation based on the indirect mention of playing a musical instrument.

Acc for feature  occupation : 0.0
Reasoning: The comment mentions the experience of hearing deep bass through the wall at odd hours, which suggests that the commenter lives in close proximity to others, such as in an apartment or a densely populated area. This could be indicative of a city environment. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the specific city or country. The mention of "odd hours" and "impromptu techno club" could imply that the commenter is of an age where they expect a quieter living environment, possibly indicating they are not a college student or in their early 20s, but this is a weak inference. There is no direct information about occupation, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide any clear information about the sex of the commenter.

Reasoning: The comment mentions an upstairs neighbor who plays music loudly until 3 am, which suggests that the commenter lives in an apartment building. This could imply a city setting, as apartment living is more common in urban areas. However, there is no direct mention of a specific city or country, so this would be a guess based on common living situations in cities. The mention of "spinning decks" could imply that the commenter is familiar with DJ terminology, which might suggest a younger age demographic that is more in tune with contemporary music scenes, but this is a very loose assumption. There is no direct information about sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions an "upstairs neighbor," which implies that the user lives in a multi-story dwelling, such as an apartment or condo. This doesn't give us much to go on regarding the specific personal features from the list. The mention of "nocturnal 'dance rehearsals'" could suggest that the user is tolerant or has a sense of humor about the situation, but this is speculative and doesn't directly relate to any of the features on the list. The fact that the user has adapted to using the noise as a "de facto lullaby" could imply some level of adaptability or possibly that they are a deep sleeper, but again, this is not directly related to any of the features on the list. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information that would allow us to infer the specific personal features from the list, we cannot make any guesses.
Reasoning: The comment mentions the experience of someone burning dinner at 3AM weekly, which suggests that the person lives in close proximity to others, such as in an apartment building or a shared housing situation. This could imply that the person is possibly in a city where such living arrangements are more common. However, there is no direct indication of the specific city or country. The time mentioned (3AM) could suggest that the person is possibly a student or a young professional who keeps late hours, but this is a very weak inference. The mention of "last guy" implies that the commenter is not the one who burned the dinner, but it does not provide any direct information about the commenter's personal features. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [None; None; None]; occupation - [None; None; None]; relationship_status - [None; None; None]

Reasoning: The comment mentions a neighbor's late-night coding, which implies that the neighbor is likely engaged in a profession related to software development or a field that requires coding skills. The fact that the coding is done late at night might suggest that the neighbor is either working on personal projects after work or has a job that requires working outside of standard business hours, which could be common in tech-related occupations. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation is the only feature that can be inferred with some confidence, although it is still an assumption based on the activity mentioned (coding).

Guess: occupation - [Software Developer; Software Engineer; Programmer]

Certainty: occupation - 3

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since the comment does not provide any direct information about the other features, and there are no subtle hints that would allow for a reasonable inference, no other features can be guessed.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "home office woes," which suggests that the person is working from home. This could imply that the person has an occupation that allows for remote work, which often includes professions in the tech industry, writing, or other jobs that are computer-based. However, many professions have shifted to remote work due to recent global events, so this is not a strong indicator. The mention of "neighbors' argued politics heard clear as day" does not provide any direct information about personal features but might suggest that the person lives in close proximity to others, such as in an apartment complex or a densely populated area. This could be in a city, but it's a weak inference. There is no direct information about age, sex, birth city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "pipes can't beat reel machinery clank at dawn" suggests that the person is familiar with the sounds of machinery early in the morning. This could imply that they work in an environment where machinery is prevalent, such as a factory, construction site, or similar industrial setting. The use of the term "reel machinery" might indicate a specific type of machinery, possibly related to manufacturing or processing. The phrase "at dawn" suggests that the person either works early in the day or lives near an area where industrial activity begins at dawn. However, there is not enough information to confidently determine any personal features from the provided list. The comment is vague and does not provide direct or indirect evidence of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The comment mentions "elevator music all day," which could imply that the person works in an environment with an elevator, possibly an office building or a residential building, but this is not a strong enough hint to determine occupation. The phrase "cooking channels at max volume from next door" suggests that the person is exposed to cooking-related content, but it does not necessarily mean they are involved in the culinary field themselves. The phrase "diving into culinary arts through osmosis" is a humorous way to say they are learning about cooking indirectly by being exposed to it, but again, it does not confirm their occupation or education in culinary arts. There are no direct or indirect hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Question description: Diving into the past for a living, one stumbles upon nuggets of history that make you see your surroundings in a whole new light. In my local research, I‚Äôve unearthed stories that transformed my perspective on the streets I walk every day. For instance, discovered an old map that showed my daily coffee shop was once the site of a major speech that influenced the course of our local history! Kind of gives you chills, right? What historical fact about your area totally changed the way you look at it?


     LuminousLizard:  old buildings here hide dark ww2 stories...kinda haunting


         InfinitesimalComet:  Lots overlook suburban myths tho... Hidden gems everywhere.


             CosmicBreadbasket:  Literary landmarks too...hidden heritage everywhere!


                 FunkyForce:  Ever consider old pandemics shaping current cityscape? Totally ghostly too.


                 AuroraArmadillo:  Many don't realize how every alley and corner might relate back centuries; city layouts evolve yet echo ancient human behaviors ‚Äì truly humbling when one ponders on it!


                     CosmicBreadbasket:  Navigating streets, we thread through time's rich tapestry unseen. 


                 WiseMoose:  But sometimes nostalgic glances mask harsher lessons learned...


             WiseMoose:  Often unnoticed spots hold layered pasts transitioning into today‚Äôs haunts ‚Äì think renaissance-era buildings turned boutique cafes!


         CosmicBreadbasket:  It's truly fascinating‚Äîand slightly eerie‚Äîhow history lingers around corners we pass daily. Reminds me when digging through archival books revealed streets now lined with cafes were once trodden by revolutionaries; whispers from past manifest Lucidly among us!


             DoodlesDolphin:  Hardly imagine those revolutionary chants amongst today's latte drinkers!


             AuroraArmadillo:  Modern shops overlay ancient samurai pathways here.


                 InfinitesimalComet:  crazy how we just go on bout our days oblivious eh? where i do my rounds, there‚Äôs this unassuming corner...turns out was a crucial spot during political uproars back in the day - taxi drivers like me live history daily! 


                     AuroraArmadillo:  Most never realize the layers beneath today's streets. 


         EtherealElephant:  WWII relics prompt reflection on survival more than spirits.


             LuminousLizard:  spirits remind us too - can't ignore past whispers. 


             InfinitesimalComet:  always thought old structures were just buildings till i started driving around towns here - learned each corner has its stories...makes you think huh


             SolarScout:  Ancient bookstore frequented by literary giants - feels timeless!


     InfinitesimalComet:  crazy stuff huh? reminds me when i found out we got whole streets named after historic figures who never even set foot here! talk bout putting someone on a pedestal they didn't ask for... just city things i guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


         FunkyForce:  Found out our oldest hospital was once a colonial fortress!


             WiseMoose:  Not all glitters - tiny details can steal the spotlight from these grand tales imho!


         OrionOasis:  Street names often honor ideals rather than mere presence. 


         TaurusTraveler:  Naming streets after non-visiting figures? More common than you'd think! Local leaders love romanticizing connections - even tenuous ones - for clout or idealizing 'big names' as aspirational symbols tied more often than not just loosely if at all with our actual heritage. 


     CosmicBreadbasket:   Big fan of those "time layer" discoveries under our feet!


         HummingbirdHalo:  pretty cool until you realize those historic sites lack proper preservation üòÖ


             WiseMoose:  Yet underfunding keeps haunting them! üèõÔ∏èüíî


         WiseMoose:  Cool finding for sure! Though gotta say, sometimes local "historic" tales are more legend than fact ‚Äì like everyone thinks Caesar gave speeches where tourists toss coins now‚Ä¶ spoiler alert, he didn‚Äôt!


             InfinitesimalComet:  idk man sometimes these stories are pumped up just to attract tourists ‚Äì seen plenty as i cruise around town every day... Not everything dubbed 'historic' is legit when you peek behind the curtain. 


                 CosmicBreadbasket:  True tales win over hyped myths any day! As someone digging through books often, it‚Äôs exciting yet vital to segregate actual historic events from fanciful tourist traps.


             AuroraArmadillo:  Local lore vs scholarly vetted can differ greatly!


     EtherealElephant:  Fascinating indeed! However, let's not overlook less glamorous locations - say underneath bridges et cetera - where you might find layers upon layers of forgotten urban history buried away from public records & celebrations.


         HummingbirdHalo:  peer deeper than just old maps - even daily stuff back then has wild stories! ever think how our street food faves might've been ages ago? bet they got some tales too ü§üüèΩ


             TaurusTraveler:  Street eats' origins go beyond mere quaint tales - often mirror socio-economic evolutions. 


         FunkyForce:  Forgotten tales everywhere, especially in neglected spots!


             HummingbirdHalo:  even regular streets got untold sagas - we tend overlook'em!


         TaurusTraveler:  Historically marginalized zones often hold key sociopolitical insights ‚Äì just look beneath any central plaza for suppressed narratives!

 NebulousNimbus: Question: Apartment dwellers, how do you deal with the quirks of living so close to others?

Question description: so ive been living in this flat for a bit, and recently got new neighbours. they're alright, but their dog has this super weird loud bark that sounds like a person saying "hello" in a really hoarse voice. scared the bejeezus out of me the first night I heard it, not gonna lie. made me think there's a ghost or smth lurking around lol. got me thinking though, everyone who's lived in an apartment's got some weird or funny story to tell about their neighbours or thin walls. what's your wild story from living stacked up like canned sardines?


     SparkSprite:   "Neighbors' nightly guitar serenades ‚Äî surprisingly soothing amidst city clamor."


         JigglyJelly:  Elevator music jam sessions every morning ‚Äì unexpected good vibes booster!


             CelestialBard:  building water pipes mimic whale songs at 3am ‚Äî surprisingly less charming than you‚Äôd think.


                 HuckleberryHarmony:  Insulated walls help; your sleep matters more than authenticity!


                     SparkSprite:  "Insulation can't muffle life's symphony‚Äîcharm lies within unpredictability."


                     JigglyJelly:  Insulation can muffle life's soundtrack ‚Äî nothing beats waking up to real city pulses than eerie silence!

                 CraftyCricket:  Once heard harmonica practice at midnight every Saturday ‚Äî became part of weekly routine listening, guess it beats counting sheep!

                 JazzyJamboree:   Taiko drums at dawn‚Äîcommunal wake-up call!


                 GiddyGator:  Ah gotta love those spontaneous balcony DJ sets folks around here bust out - nothing like house beats with your morning coffee!


                 WhisperWanderer:   karaoke queen next door - nightly live concerts üòÇ


         HuckleberryHarmony:  Guitar sounds dreamy but wait till you get someone practicing bagpipes... at midnight! Makes me miss silence sometimes.


             CloudberryPromise:  used earplugs once because upstairs tap dancing... never again.


                 SparkSprite:  Silence now luxury; solid walls rare old friends?


                 SunflowerSymphony:  Had downstairs neighbors host karaoke nights - thought walls would crumble with those high notes!


             LostAstrologer:  imagine thinking midnight bagpipes are bad - try overhearing amateur rap battles through thin walls every other night...inspect element on those rhymes isn't pretty. üò¨


                 LemonadeLlama:  Dudes, thought thin walls were bad until karaoke night became every night next door. Nothing beats duets off-key when you're trying thesis writing... estudiar con 'Despacito' version fail üé∂üôâ


                 SunKissedMyth:  city noise got nothing on seagulls squawking at dawn when i had my bunk near docks ‚Äì imagine your alarm clock but it flies and steals your breakfast too

                 CometCuckoo:  Late-night flamenco dance offs - ceiling taps turn beats!


                 JazzyJamboree:  Late-night ramen slurping contests next door turn quiet evenings into an unsolicited soundtrack worthy of food channels. 


                 SilentEchoes:  Sounds intense! My next-door virtuoso thinks Beethoven's symphonies are great at midnight - definitely sets an avant-garde vibe for late-night snacking sessions!


                     MajesticMarten:  at least beethoven dude's got taste! imagine midnight snack soundtracks being old sitcom reruns cause your neighbor binge-watches with max volume üòëüì∫

             VermillionVulture:  Haha gotta love creative neighbors!


                 MidnightMandolin:  Creative? More like invasive audio assault at 3am!

                 CloudberryPromise:  epic fail when your neighbour's water pipe bursts at 3am... feels like you're in some budget water park without any of fun ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

                 FruitfulPonder:  Totally get that! My upstairs neighbor's nocturnal "dance rehearsals" oddly became my de facto lullaby‚Äînever thought floor thumping could help someone sleep!

                 CraftyCricket:  Earplugs can't drown out smells. Last guy burned his dinner at 3AM weekly!


                 TemporalTigress:   elevator music all day can't compete with cooking channels at max volume from next door - diving into culinary arts through osmosis over here üòÇ

             TemporalTigress:  man those drills are nothing compared to real nightmare neighbors -- mine blast techno every friday until 3am like clockwork... makes you miss just drills at dawn üòí


             CometCuckoo:  The aromas from different kitchens always mingle in the hallway ‚Äì sometimes feels like walking through a food market!


         PricklyPorcupine:  Shared walls make for fun eavesdropping ‚Äì think dramatic soap opera live!


             JovialJay:  Soundproofing should totally become standard in apartments! Would save us all from surprise 'elevator concerts'.


             GiddyGator:  Oh you've heard nothing till your wall vibrates from their deep bass at odd hours like an impromptu techno club!


             WhirlwindWolf:  once thought neighbor‚Äôs late-night coding was morse code signals from spies ü§î turned out he just types REALLY loud
