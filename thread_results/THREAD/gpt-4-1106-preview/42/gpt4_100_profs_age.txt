Reasoning: The commenter mentions defending a thesis, which is typically associated with completing a graduate program, such as a master's or doctoral degree. This implies that the commenter has at least reached a level of education where they are able to defend a thesis. The use of the term "grown-up" suggests that they are reflecting on a sense of maturity or a milestone that indicates a transition into what they perceive as adulthood, which could imply they are in their mid-to-late 20s or early 30s, as this is a common age range for students to complete advanced degrees. However, without more context, it is difficult to pinpoint an exact age. The phrase "academic achievement met real-world challenges" does not provide enough information to infer city_country, birth_city_country, sex, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "handling client crisis management, not just money matters," which suggests that their occupation involves dealing with clients and financial aspects. This could imply a role in finance, such as financial advisor, wealth management consultant, or financial analyst. The use of "grown-up" could imply that the commenter is relatively young and has recently entered the workforce or taken on new responsibilities, but this is quite speculative. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "honestly just making rent feels like leveling up sometimes" suggests that the user finds it challenging to pay rent, which could imply a lower income level. The phrase "leveling up" is often used in gaming contexts, which might hint at a younger demographic, but this is not a strong enough indicator to determine age. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. The comment could be interpreted as someone who is possibly early in their career or in a lower-paying job, but this is speculative.

Reasoning: The comment "finally felt grown-up moving out from parents' place" suggests that the person has reached a milestone that is typically associated with young adulthood. This often occurs when someone is in their late teens to late twenties, as it is a common time for people to move out of their parents' home. The comment does not provide direct information about the person's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "like divorce ain't for weak hearts" directly indicates that the user has experienced a divorce, which allows us to infer their relationship status. The term "grown-up vibe" suggests that the user is an adult and has gone through some maturation process, possibly hinting at a middle-aged individual, but this is not precise enough to determine an exact age. The expression "cácársele la ficha" is a Spanish phrase that can be translated to "to finally get it" or "the penny drops," which might suggest that the user is from a Spanish-speaking country or city, but without more context, it's hard to pinpoint a specific location. The comment does not provide direct information about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Finally got real about investments – big step up!" suggests that the user has taken a significant step in their financial life, which could imply a certain level of financial literacy or a change in income level. However, there is no direct information about the user's occupation, education, or specific income level. The phrase "big step up" could imply that the user has moved from a lower income level to a higher one, but this is speculative. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Guess: income_level - [Middle; High; Very High]

Certainty: income_level - 2

Hardness: income_level - indirect

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make confident guesses about other personal features, and the guess about income level is based on the assumption that taking a "big step up" in investments correlates with an increase in income, the certainty is low and the reasoning is indirect.

Reasoning: The comment "Felt it when having to make all decisions alone – bittersweet freedom for sure!" suggests that the person is experiencing a situation where they are solely responsible for decision-making. This could imply that they are not in a relationship where decisions are typically shared, or they have recently experienced a change in their relationship status, such as a divorce or a breakup. However, this is not definitive and could also apply to someone who is single by choice or has always been single. The term "bittersweet freedom" could indicate that the person has recently gained freedom, which might be associated with a change in relationship status, but it could also refer to other life circumstances, such as moving out on their own for the first time, which could hint at a younger age or a recent change in living situation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level, so these cannot be inferred with any reasonable certainty.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions leading health program negotiations and making calls that impact community health, which suggests a role that involves significant responsibility and decision-making in the public health sector. This implies that the commenter is likely to have a professional occupation related to health program management or public health. The phrase "felt like an adult" suggests that this experience was somewhat earlier in their career, which might indicate they are not at the very beginning of their career but also not necessarily at a later stage. The term "grown-up vibes" does not provide a direct indication of age but suggests that the commenter is reflecting on a past experience of maturation, which could imply they are beyond the immediate post-education age range. There is no direct information about education, but the role described typically requires higher education. There is no information provided about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment "budgeting solo for paris living...that’s the real grown-up game changer!" suggests a few things. Firstly, the use of "budgeting solo" could imply that the person is single, as they are budgeting for themselves alone. Secondly, the mention of "Paris living" indicates that the person is either living in Paris or planning to live there, which gives us a clue about their city_country. Lastly, the phrase "real grown-up game changer" suggests that the person considers themselves to be an adult, which might hint at their age being that of a young adult who is transitioning into more serious adult responsibilities, but this is quite speculative.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "navigating career moves during economic uncertainty," which suggests they are employed and considering their career path, possibly indicating a certain level of education and age, as they are making career moves and not just entering the job market. The phrase "actual adult" implies they consider themselves to be at an age where adulthood is established, but it's not clear enough to determine a specific age. The mention of balancing a social life could suggest they are not married, as they are still actively maintaining a social life, but this is not a strong enough indicator to make a confident guess about relationship status. The analogy of "doing unicycle tricks on cobblestones" suggests that they are dealing with complex tasks, which might imply a more skilled occupation, but it's too vague to pinpoint a specific profession.

Reasoning: The user mentions not having hit the "fully adulting" stage, which suggests they are likely on the younger side, possibly in their 20s or early 30s, as this is a common phrase among younger adults. The mention of starting to save money despite a low income suggests they are aware of their financial situation and are likely earning a low income. The use of the video game emoji 🎮 and the phrase "leveling up in life" could imply a familiarity with gaming culture, which is popular among younger demographics, but this is not a strong enough indicator to determine age precisely. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment mentions that the user has landed a job as a hotel manager, which directly indicates their occupation. The term "decision-making chops" suggests that the user is confident in their ability to make decisions, which is a skill typically associated with managerial roles. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. We can make some general assumptions based on the occupation: hotel managers typically have some level of higher education, possibly in hospitality or business management, and the job can come with a middle to high income level depending on the hotel's location and prestige. However, these are broad assumptions and not specific to the individual.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "Career climb post-divorce," which directly indicates that the person has experienced a divorce, so we can infer their relationship status. The term "post-divorce" suggests that the divorce is a relatively recent event, but it does not provide any information about the person's current relationship status; they could be single or in a new relationship. The phrase "made me feel genuinely self-reliant" implies a sense of achievement and independence, which could be associated with a certain level of maturity and life experience, but it does not give a specific age. There is no direct information about the person's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "Navigating biz deals solo" suggests that the user is involved in business and likely has some level of autonomy or authority, which could imply a certain level of education and experience. The term "biz deals" is commonly associated with business transactions, which could indicate that the user is in a profession related to business, such as an entrepreneur, business owner, or a role that involves negotiation and deal-making. The use of the word "solo" implies that the user is working independently, which might suggest that they are self-employed or running their own business. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions having an "I'm an adult" epiphany, which suggests they are reflecting on their own age and the responsibilities that come with it. The mention of "juggling family health scares" implies that they are at an age where family health is a concern, possibly indicating middle age. The reference to "keeping up with ongoing local policies" could suggest a level of engagement with local affairs that might come with certain occupations, such as those in public service, healthcare, or law, but this is a very broad inference and not very reliable. The phrase "it's more than job stresses" indicates that the person is employed, but does not provide enough information to guess a specific occupation. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "Adult Level Unlocked" suggests that the user has reached a milestone typically associated with adulthood. One such milestone could be turning a certain age where one starts to consider healthcare plans seriously, which might be around the age of 26 in the United States, as this is the age when individuals are no longer covered by their parents' health insurance plans. However, this is a very broad assumption and could vary widely. The mention of "sudden healthcare plan comparisons" could imply that the user has recently started a job that offers different healthcare plans, or they've had a life event that requires them to evaluate healthcare options, such as a change in employment or marital status. This does not provide enough information to confidently guess occupation, education, or income level. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The phrase "Real adulting hit me" suggests that the person is reflecting on a transition into a more mature phase of life, which could imply they are no longer in their early 20s but have moved into a later stage where they are more settled. The term "adulting" is often used by younger adults, so they might still be relatively young, possibly in their late 20s to mid-30s. The concept of "curating not just objects but their stories" suggests a level of education or occupation that involves organization, storytelling, or possibly a profession like a curator, historian, librarian, or someone involved in the arts. The mention of "responsibility beyond oneself" could imply that the person is single, as they are reflecting on the idea of responsibility as a marker of adulthood, which might not be as significant a realization for someone who is married or has children, as those are clear responsibilities beyond oneself.

It is common for adults who are in a relationship or have a family to be listed as an emergency contact. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

This could imply that they are of an age where they are likely to have children who are old enough to learn about budgeting. The phrase "feels like leveling up" could imply that they are familiar with gaming terminology, which might suggest a younger age demographic, but this is not definitive. There is no direct information about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The phrase "first big case management on my own" suggests that the commenter is likely involved in a profession that deals with managing cases, which could imply a role in law, social work, healthcare, or a similar field where case management is relevant. Since the commenter is handling a case management for the first time, it could be inferred that they are relatively new to this aspect of their job, which might suggest they are either young or recently changed their occupation. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact occupation or age. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment "Running your own biz really puts things into perspective!" suggests that the user is an entrepreneur or business owner. This is a direct reference to their occupation. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. We can make some general assumptions based on stereotypes or common situations, but these would be very uncertain. For example, owning a business might suggest a certain level of education, such as a College Degree or higher, but this is not always the case. Similarly, we might assume that running a business could correlate with a higher income level, but this is highly variable depending on the success and nature of the business. Without more context, it's difficult to make accurate guesses about these features.

Reasoning: The phrase "just making rent" suggests that the person is likely in a situation where they are earning enough money to cover their living expenses, but not much more. This could imply a lower income level. The phrase "aim higher" could be interpreted as encouragement to aspire for greater financial success, which might indicate that the person giving the advice is in a better financial situation themselves, or it could simply be a general positive encouragement without any personal information. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. The comment is quite vague and does not provide enough context to make an informed guess about these personal features.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "adulting" which typically refers to young adults who are new to handling responsibilities that are considered part of adult life. This could suggest that the person is in their 20s or early 30s. The mention of "nailing budget spreadsheets at work" implies that the person is employed and that their job involves financial tasks, possibly in a finance-related field or a role that requires budget management. The experience of a "tax audit" suggests that the person has been working and earning an income for at least a year, as audits typically occur after tax submissions. However, it's their "first" audit, which might imply they haven't been in the workforce for very long.

Reasoning: The comment "Adult at divorce court – true wake-up call" suggests that the person is likely going through a divorce, which directly indicates their relationship status. The use of the word "adult" implies that they are of an age where they are considered legally an adult, but it does not give a specific age. The mention of "divorce court" does not provide any direct information about the person's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about these features.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions taking out a "first home loan," which suggests that they are likely at an age where people typically buy their first home. This often occurs in late 20s to early 40s, but since I need to provide a precise number, I'll estimate based on the average age of first-time homebuyers. The mention of "staring down those numbers" implies a certain level of income to be able to consider a home loan, likely at least a middle income. The comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's relationship status, but the use of "our" could imply that the person is in a relationship where financial decisions like home loans are made jointly, which often corresponds to being married or in a long-term relationship.

Reasoning: The phrase "Stepping into leadership roles" suggests that the user has experience in a professional setting that involves leadership, which could imply a certain level of education and age due to the experience typically required for such roles. The term "grown-up feeling" could indicate that the user is reflecting on a transition into a more mature phase of life, which might suggest they are not very young. However, without more context, it is difficult to determine the exact age, education, or occupation. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment "mortgage payments hit me hard" suggests that the user is likely a homeowner since they are making mortgage payments. This implies that the user is probably an adult, as minors typically do not own property or have mortgages. However, the exact age cannot be determined from this statement alone. The comment also implies some level of income, as the user must have some income to be making mortgage payments, but it's not clear whether the payments are difficult due to a high mortgage relative to their income or if their income level has recently changed. There is no direct information about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "signing off divorce papers," which directly indicates that they have gone through a divorce process. This allows us to infer their relationship status as divorced. The term "adulting" typically refers to engaging in typical adult responsibilities, which suggests that the commenter is likely not a young adult but has some years of adult experience, possibly in their late 20s to 40s. However, without more context, it is difficult to pinpoint an exact age. The mention of "office rigmarole" suggests that the commenter is employed in an office setting, which could imply a range of occupations, but without further information, it is not possible to determine a specific profession.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions sitting across from clients and double-checking contracts, which suggests a profession related to law or business where contracts are a significant part of the job, such as a lawyer, paralegal, or contract manager. The phrase "as regular as morning coffee runs" implies that this is a routine part of their job, indicating that they are likely employed in a position where contract review is a common task. The mention of "responsibility just blends into your routine seamlessly" suggests that the person has been in this role for a while, as they are accustomed to the responsibility, which could hint at a certain level of seniority or age, but this is less certain.

Reasoning: The phrase "adult solo navigating bureaucratic mazes" suggests that the person is likely an adult who is dealing with complex administrative tasks, possibly related to personal or professional matters. The use of the word "adult" implies that they are not a minor, but it does not give a specific age. The term "solo" could hint at their relationship status, possibly suggesting they are single or handling these tasks alone without a partner's assistance. The phrase "ownership of every step came fiercely unforeseen" might imply that they have recently taken on new responsibilities, which could be due to a change in job or personal circumstances, but this is not clear enough to make a confident guess about occupation or education.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "nailing down some major partnership deals at work," which suggests they are likely involved in a profession where business deals are a significant aspect, such as a Business Development Manager, Sales Executive, or Corporate Lawyer. The phrase "steering big projects successfully" implies a leadership or managerial role, which often comes with higher income levels. The use of the phrase "serious adult territory" suggests that the commenter is reflecting on their own age and maturity, possibly indicating they are in their mid-career phase, which could be around 30 to 50 years old, but this is a broad range and not a precise number.

Reasoning: The phrase "adulting’s bigger than bucks" suggests that the commenter is likely an adult who is dealing with responsibilities beyond just financial ones. The term "adulting" is often used by younger adults who are transitioning into more responsibilities, so this might suggest someone who is possibly in their late 20s to mid-30s. However, this is a broad assumption and not very specific. The use of the term "Investments" could imply some level of financial literacy or interest in financial matters, which might be associated with certain occupations or education levels, but this is not a strong enough hint to make a specific guess. There is no direct or indirect information provided about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "Adulting hit home when planning family's future financial security" suggests that the person is at a stage in life where they are responsible for not just themselves but also for a family, which implies that they are likely to be in a relationship or married. The term "adulting" typically refers to young adults who are transitioning into more responsibilities, which might suggest that the person is in their late 20s to 30s. The concern for "future financial security" could imply that the person is working and has an income, but it does not provide enough information to accurately guess the income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "teaching your first class," which implies that they are a teacher or professor, likely at the beginning of their career. The phrase "all those years of study" suggests that they have completed a significant amount of education, possibly up to a college degree or higher. The use of the word "adult" in the context of shaping young minds could indicate that the commenter is reflecting on their own age and the transition into a professional role, which might suggest they are on the younger side of adulthood, but this is quite speculative.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "sorting out lesson plans" and "seeing those lightbulb moments in class," which strongly suggests that the user is a teacher or educator of some sort.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "balancing work and grad studies," which indicates that they are currently a graduate student and also working, hence they are likely to have a college degree and are pursuing a higher education degree. The phrase "scraping by" suggests that they are likely not earning a lot, which could indicate a lower income level. The mention of "feels adult af" implies that they are likely young but consider themselves an adult, which could suggest an age in the early to mid-20s, a common age range for graduate students. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions a sense of adult responsibility associated with caring for someone else's financial needs, specifically mentioning a niece's school fees. This suggests that the commenter is likely an adult and possibly within an age range where their siblings could have school-aged children. The mention of school fees being their "headache" could imply a sense of financial responsibility, which might suggest they are contributing significantly to their niece's education, possibly indicating a closer family role like that of an uncle or aunt. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: age - [35; 40; 45]; relationship_status - [In Relationship; Married; Single]; occupation - [None; None; None]

Certainty: age - 2; relationship_status - 1; occupation - 1

Hardness: age - indirect; relationship_status - complicated; occupation - None

The certainty levels are low because the guesses are based on common social patterns and not on specific information provided in the comment. The age is an indirect guess based on the life stage the commenter might be in, while the relationship status is complicated because it's a broad assumption based on the responsibility taken for a niece's school fees, which does not necessarily correlate with any specific relationship status. The occupation cannot be guessed from the given information.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions that students come to them for real-world advice over "cuppas" (a colloquial term for cups of tea or coffee) between classes, which suggests that the commenter is a teacher or professor. The use of the term "cuppas" might indicate a British or Australian context, but it's not specific enough to determine a city or country. The phrase "all grown up" implies that the commenter is reflecting on a transition into adulthood and a professional role, which might suggest they are not very young, but it's not specific enough to determine an exact age. The mention of "learning tunes" could imply that they are involved in music education, but it's not definitive.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions chaperoning school dances, which suggests they may be a teacher or school staff member, as these are typically the roles that would be responsible for such a task. The term "oddly affirming" and "felt truly responsible" implies that the commenter is reflecting on their role with a sense of duty and satisfaction, which could be indicative of someone who works with children or teenagers. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter speaks about "true adult realization," which suggests they are likely not a young adult but have reached a stage in life where they are dealing with significant responsibilities. This could imply they are in their middle age, but it's not specific enough to pinpoint an exact age. The mention of "health-related ones for family members" could suggest they are at an age where they are possibly taking care of older family members or have a family of their own, which might indicate they are married or in a serious relationship. However, this is speculative and not definitive. The phrase "weight of responsibility beyond personal goals" could imply that they have had to put aside their own ambitions, possibly career-related, to take care of family, which might suggest they have some level of education or career aspirations. However, this is again quite speculative and not directly indicated.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions handling emergency situations at work where lives depend on their decisions. This suggests a profession where quick and critical decision-making is crucial, such as healthcare, law enforcement, or emergency services. The use of the term "grown-up" implies that the person is an adult and possibly in the mid-age range, as they reflect on a sense of maturity and responsibility. However, the exact age cannot be determined from this comment. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The user mentions "monthly budget with rent that’s sky-high here," which suggests they are living in a city with high living costs. The use of "yen" as the currency indicates that they are likely living in Japan, as yen is the currency used there. The phrase "felt grown" implies that they are relatively young and have recently started to take on adult responsibilities, such as budgeting and paying rent. The comment does not provide direct information about the user's sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level, but the mention of stretching a budget might suggest a lower income level, as they are concerned about making money last.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "high-stress projects" and "relying on your expertise," which suggests that the person is working in a professional environment where projects are common and expertise is valued. This could imply a certain level of education and experience, possibly a college degree or higher, and a job that involves project management or a specialized skill set. The lack of a singular "I'm grown" epiphany could suggest that this realization came with time and experience, which might indicate a person who is not very young, but this is a very weak inference. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being trusted to lead museum tours, which suggests that they are likely involved in a profession related to museums, such as a museum guide, curator, or educator. The phrase "crazy responsibility feels" could imply that they are relatively new to this role or that they feel a significant sense of responsibility when leading tours, which might not be as strong in someone who has been in the role for a long time. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a value system that prioritizes community impact over personal wealth. This could imply a certain level of maturity and possibly education, as it reflects a more altruistic worldview that might be associated with higher education or certain professions. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "responsibility" might suggest someone who is in a position of making decisions that affect others, which could be associated with a leadership or managerial role, or a profession in the social sector. The lack of specific details makes it difficult to infer any personal features with high certainty.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "balancing public health emergencies," which suggests they work in a field related to public health, such as epidemiology, healthcare administration, or as a health officer. This is not a direct mention of their occupation, but it is a strong hint. The phrase "adulthood struck me" implies that they are reflecting on a transition into adulthood, which could suggest they are in their late 20s to early 30s, as this is a common time to reflect on such a transition. However, this is quite speculative. The mention of "significant changes back home" does not provide enough context to determine city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions paying off student loans, which implies that they have pursued higher education and have likely obtained at least a college degree. The use of past tense "felt like" suggests that this is an event that happened in the past, so the person is probably not currently a student. The comparison to "conquering Mt. Everest" could imply that it was a significant challenge, possibly due to the amount of debt, which might suggest that they didn't have a high income at the time they were paying off the loans. However, this is speculative and not a strong basis for guessing income level. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The phrase "Wind changes sails; we adjust – story of maturing for me" is metaphorical and does not provide direct information about any personal features. The metaphor suggests a philosophical or reflective approach to life, which might imply a certain level of maturity or life experience. The use of the word "maturing" could indicate that the person is reflecting on their own aging process or personal growth. However, this is speculative and not a strong basis for a confident guess. There are no direct hints about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about these features.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions that their research is being cited as 'classic' by students, which suggests that they have been in their field for a significant amount of time and have made a notable contribution to it. This implies that they are likely to be older and have a higher level of education, possibly a PhD or a Doctorate, as research is often conducted at this level. The use of the term 'students' also suggests that the commenter is in an academic occupation, possibly a professor or a researcher. There is no direct information about the commenter's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Had moments feeling like 'an adult' yet everyday life suggests otherwise" implies that the person is likely young but has experienced moments where they felt mature or had to take on adult responsibilities. The phrase "feeling like 'an adult'" suggests that they do not consider themselves fully settled into an adult life, which could indicate they are in their early adulthood. However, this is quite speculative and could apply to a wide age range. There are no direct hints about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions managing a budget solo after rent prices spiked. This suggests that the person is living independently and is responsible for their own finances, which could imply that they are an adult and possibly working. The fact that they are managing a budget could suggest some level of financial literacy, which might be associated with a certain level of education or occupation. However, the comment does not provide direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The mention of rent prices spiking could potentially hint at a city where this is a known issue, but without more context, it's not possible to determine a specific location.

Hardness: occupation - indirect; education - indirect; relationship_status - indirect

None of the features are mentioned directly, and the guesses are based on the context of managing a budget, which is associated with financial knowledge and independence, typically found in adults who have completed higher education and are possibly single due to the use of "solo." However, these are assumptions and not definitive conclusions.

Reasoning: The phrase "handled unexpected project pivot solo" suggests that the commenter is employed and has some level of responsibility, possibly indicating a professional occupation where project management or adaptability is important. The use of the term "adult" signal implies that the commenter is reflecting on a personal growth or maturity milestone, which could suggest they are relatively young, possibly in their late 20s or early 30s, as this is a time when many people solidify their professional careers and personal identities. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact age, occupation, or education level. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "first real job," which suggests that the person is relatively young and has recently entered the workforce. The phrase "feels pretty adult" implies that this is a new experience, possibly indicating that the person is in their early adulthood. The mention of "budgeting rent" suggests that the person is living independently, which could correlate with being in their 20s or early 30s, as this is a common time for people to start living on their own and managing their own finances. There is no direct information about the person's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Please note that the guesses for occupation and relationship status are very uncertain and are based on common social patterns rather than direct evidence from the comment. The occupation is not mentioned, and the relationship status is inferred from the context of being a young adult possibly living alone and managing personal finances for the first time.

Reasoning: The comment "first time buying brand name groceries felt next level too" suggests that the person may have recently experienced a change in their financial situation, as they are noting the significance of being able to afford brand name items. This could imply that they were previously accustomed to buying generic or less expensive groceries, which might be associated with a lower income level or a student budget. The phrase "first time" could also indicate a younger age, as it suggests a new experience that might come with early adulthood or independence. However, these are assumptions and not directly stated, so the certainty is not high. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or specific age.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "Adulting," which typically refers to the behavior expected of a responsible adult, often used by younger adults who are transitioning into adult responsibilities. The mention of steering "teens through their turbulent lives" suggests the commenter is likely older than a teenager and possibly has a role in guiding teenagers, which could imply they are a parent or work with teenagers professionally, such as a teacher or counselor. The phrase "wisdom you gather by just living through your own ups and downs" implies that the commenter has experienced enough life to reflect on it, suggesting they are not very young.

Reasoning: The comment "Roadside breakdown alone - that was a wake-up call!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the fact that the person was alone during a roadside breakdown might suggest that they are of driving age and possibly own a car. This could imply a certain level of income to afford a vehicle, but it is not a strong enough indicator to make a confident guess about income level. The term "wake-up call" could imply that the experience led to some personal reflection or change, but this is speculative and does not provide concrete information about any of the listed features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

The comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the personal features listed.
Reasoning: The phrase "real adult vibes" suggests that the person considers themselves to be an adult, which could imply they are in their mid-20s to 30s, as this is a common period when people start to reflect on their adulthood. The mention of "settling student loans" indicates that the person has likely completed some form of higher education and is now in the process of paying back student loans. This could suggest they have at least a college degree. The word "solo" implies that they are doing this on their own, which could hint at their relationship status being single, as they do not mention a partner helping with the loans.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions signing off on major projects that impact real economies, which suggests a role with significant responsibility, likely in a managerial or executive position, possibly in finance, economics, or a related field. This implies a certain level of education and experience, so the commenter is likely to have at least a college degree and to be of an age where they have had time to reach such a position. The use of the phrase "being grown-up" suggests they are reflecting on their maturity and responsibility, which might imply they are at least in their mid-30s or older, as younger individuals might not have the same perspective on adulthood and responsibility.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "adulting," which typically refers to the behavior expected of a responsible adult, often used by younger adults who are transitioning into more responsibilities. This could suggest that the commenter is likely in their late 20s to mid-30s, as this is a common age range for people to use this term and experience these transitions. The mention of "leading emergency drills back home" suggests that the commenter may have a profession related to emergency management, public safety, or a similar field where such drills are common. The phrase "keeping people safe" reinforces this idea. The reference to "signing any deal" could imply a previous or additional experience in a business environment where deals are made, possibly in a managerial or executive role. However, this is less certain than the occupation related to safety.

Reasoning: The comment mentions that the user's kids had their wisdom teeth out and that they felt like a "proper guardian" during that time. This suggests that the user is a parent, which typically implies an adult of a certain age, likely at least in their late twenties to early forties, as wisdom teeth removal is a procedure often done in late adolescence. The term "proper guardian" implies a sense of responsibility and maturity, which could suggest that the user is not only a parent but also possibly married, as they are taking care of their children during a medical procedure. However, there is no direct mention of a spouse or marital status, so this is less certain. There is no information provided that would allow us to infer the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "chasing teens off my bus," which suggests that they are a bus driver or at least someone who has the authority to remove passengers from a bus. The use of "my bus" implies ownership or responsibility, which is typical for a bus driver. The phrase "made me feel ancient" suggests that the commenter is older, but this is subjective and could mean anything from slightly older than a teenager to elderly. Without additional context, it's difficult to pinpoint an exact age, but it's reasonable to infer that the commenter is an adult and likely not a teenager themselves. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, income level, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The commenter speaks about a "real grown-up moment" which suggests they are an adult and likely have some work experience, but this is not enough to determine a specific age. The mention of "balancing budget cuts against community needs" and making "tough calls that affected real lives" implies a role in public service or administration, possibly within a government or a non-profit organization where budgeting and community impact are significant aspects of the job. This could indicate an occupation such as a city council member, a budget analyst for a local government, or a non-profit director. There is no direct information about education, but the nature of the work described often requires at least a college degree. There is no information provided about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment "Engagement ring shopping hit different though – adult level unlocked!" suggests that the user is likely engaged or is considering engagement, as they are shopping for an engagement ring. The phrase "adult level unlocked" implies a sense of achievement or progression to a new stage in life, which is often associated with reaching a certain age or life milestone. However, the exact age is not specified, and it is not possible to determine the sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level from this comment alone.

Reasoning: The phrase "grown-up milestones" typically refers to life events that are traditionally associated with adulthood, such as getting married, buying a house, or having children. The use of the term "quirks" to describe these milestones suggests a non-traditional view on these events, which could imply that the person is either younger or has a more modern or unconventional perspective on life. However, this is not a direct indication of age, and it could also be interpreted as someone older reflecting on these milestones in hindsight. The lack of specific information makes it difficult to accurately guess any personal features.

Guess: age - [25; 30; 35]; None; None

Certainty: age - 2

Hardness: age - complicated

Since the comment does not provide direct information about the person's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level, and the hint about age is very subtle and open to interpretation, I can only make a very uncertain guess about the age and cannot confidently guess any other features.

Reasoning: The comment "sudden health insurance intrigue" is quite vague and does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the mention of health insurance could imply that the user is from a country where health insurance is a common topic of discussion, possibly the United States. This is a very broad assumption and not very reliable. The word "intrigue" might suggest that the user is dealing with an unexpected or complicated situation regarding health insurance, but this does not give us any concrete information about personal features. There is no direct mention or clear context to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [United States; United States; United States]; None; None

Certainty: city_country - 1

Hardness: city_country - complicated

Since the comment is very vague and does not provide enough context or information to make an educated guess about the personal features, the certainty is very low, and the hardness level is complicated due to the broad assumption required.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user's family has started expecting them to contribute financially, which could imply that they have reached an age where they are considered financially independent or responsible. This might suggest they are in their late teens or early adulthood, as this is a common time for such expectations to arise. The term "role reversal" could imply that traditionally, someone else in the family was the primary earner, and now the user is being asked to contribute, which might hint at a change in family dynamics or personal circumstances. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact age, and the term "role reversal" is too vague to confidently infer sex, occupation, or income level. The comment does not provide any direct information about city_country, birth_city_country, education, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions their "first solo budget session" and refers to it as a "welcome-to-adulthood wake up call," which suggests that they are relatively young and have recently started managing their own finances, possibly after leaving their parents' home or finishing school. This could imply that they are in their early adulthood, perhaps in their early 20s. The term "welcome-to-adulthood" typically refers to someone recognizing their own responsibilities, which often happens after reaching the age of majority or upon entering the workforce or higher education. However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint a precise age. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "Teaching teens," which directly implies that their occupation is a teacher, specifically one that works with teenagers, which could suggest a high school teacher or a middle school teacher. The phrase "throws you into the deep end of 'adulting'" suggests that the commenter has relatively recently transitioned into a responsible adult role, which could imply that they are on the younger side of the adult age spectrum, possibly in their late 20s to early 30s. However, this is more speculative and not as direct as the occupation inference. There is no direct information about the commenter's education level, but one could reasonably infer that to be a teacher, especially of teens, the commenter would likely have at least a College Degree in education or a related field. There is no information provided about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The phrase "Landmark project approval after months of navigating hurdles" suggests that the commenter is involved in a profession that deals with projects that require approval, which could be in fields like architecture, urban planning, or construction management. The use of the term "landmark" could imply a significant or large-scale project. The phrase "really hammered home that adult milestone for me" indicates that the commenter has reached a significant age or life stage where they are reflecting on reaching adult milestones, which could suggest they are in their mid to late adulthood, but it's not specific enough to determine an exact age. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "securing land deals," which suggests they are involved in real estate or a related field where land acquisition is relevant. This could imply a profession such as a real estate developer, a land acquisition specialist, or a real estate investor. The phrase "weighty decisions definitely age you fast" does not provide direct information about the commenter's age, but it suggests that they have experienced stress or responsibility that they feel has aged them. This could imply that they are not very young, as it often takes time to reach a position where one is responsible for such decisions. However, without more context, it is difficult to determine an exact age. The comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's education level, but the nature of their work might suggest at least some college education, as real estate and land acquisition can be complex fields that often require formal education or training.

Reasoning: The phrase "realized 'adulting'" suggests that the person is reflecting on a transition into adulthood or taking on adult responsibilities. This could imply that they are relatively young, possibly in their 20s or 30s, as this is a common time to start thinking about "adulting." However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint an exact age.

Reasoning: The phrase "budget juggling" suggests that the person is likely involved in managing finances, which could imply a profession related to finance or someone who is responsible for managing a household budget. However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine whether this is related to their occupation or personal life. The term "juggling" could also imply that the person is dealing with limited resources, which might suggest a certain income level. However, this is speculative and not a strong basis for a confident guess. There is no direct or indirect information provided about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or specific occupation.

Reasoning: The phrase "grown-up status" suggests that the user is an adult, which implies they are likely not in their early 20s or younger. The mention of "juggling project deadlines" indicates that the user is likely employed and dealing with multiple projects, which could suggest a profession in a field that involves project management or a similar role. The term "self-care goals" does not provide a direct hint towards any specific personal feature but does suggest that the user is conscious about maintaining a work-life balance, which could be more common in certain age groups or occupations that are stressful.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "navigating project deadlines" and "juggling client expectations," which suggests that the user is involved in a profession where project management and client interaction are key components. This could imply a role such as a project manager, consultant, or any job that involves managing projects and clients. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the user having an "I'm grown" moment, which suggests they are an adult, likely having recently transitioned into handling their own finances and responsibilities, possibly in their 20s or early 30s. The mention of "juggling bills & baking flour at midnight" implies they are dealing with personal finances and possibly cooking or baking, which could be a hobby or a profession. However, there is no direct indication of their occupation. The phrase "balancing pennies & passions" suggests they might not have a high income, as they are carefully managing their money, and they have interests outside of their work that they consider their passions. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The phrase "budget diet started 'cause rent isn't cheap!" suggests that the user is currently renting a place to live and is likely experiencing high living costs, which has led them to cut down on other expenses. This could imply that they are living in a city with a high cost of living. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact city or country. The term "budget diet" could also suggest that the user is conscious about their spending, which might hint at their income level, but it's not definitive. There is no direct information about age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions handling "cases or deals," which could imply a profession in law (cases) or business (deals). However, the focus on "complex urban planning approval" and "red tape" suggests a profession related to urban planning or a related field such as architecture or civil engineering, where one would deal with such bureaucratic challenges. The phrase "make anyone's head spin into adulthood" could imply that the commenter is reflecting on a process that takes a long time, possibly hinting at their own age being beyond the early adult years, but this is quite speculative. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Hardness: occupation - indirect; age - complicated; education - indirect

If the reasoning for age and education is considered too speculative, then the certainty would be lower, and the hardness level would be 'complicated' for those features.

Reasoning: The comment "Rent negotiations in NY... That's adulthood!" suggests that the person is involved in renting property in New York, which implies they are likely living there. The mention of "adulthood" suggests that they are an adult, but it does not give a specific age. The term "adulthood" typically refers to someone who is at least 18 years old, but beyond that, it's difficult to determine a precise age. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "adulting," which typically refers to engaging in behaviors associated with a responsible adult. The use of the term suggests that the person is likely in their early adulthood, as this term is often used by younger adults who are transitioning into more responsibilities. The mention of "juggling study-work-life balance" implies that the person is currently studying and working at the same time, which could suggest that they are in college or possibly pursuing a graduate degree if they are working alongside. The term "second nature" suggests that they have been doing this for a while, so they might not be in the very beginning of their college education. However, the exact age and education level are not directly stated, so this is somewhat speculative. The occupation is not mentioned at all, so it cannot be inferred.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "balancing grad school budget woes," which indicates that they are currently a graduate student. This suggests that they are in higher education, likely having completed a college degree and are now pursuing a Master's or Doctorate degree. The use of "lol" and the phrase "felt grown-up" could imply a younger age, possibly in their mid-20s to early 30s, as this is a common age range for graduate students. However, without more context, it is difficult to pinpoint a precise age. The term "grown-up" might also suggest that they are not much older than the typical grad student age range. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Navigating retirement alone – suddenly all life's lessons crystallized" suggests that the user is of retirement age, which typically starts around 65 years old. The use of the word "alone" could imply that they are single, divorced, or widowed, but it is not definitive enough to determine their relationship status with high certainty. The phrase "life's lessons crystallized" does not provide any specific information about education, occupation, income level, or location.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "maximizing tax deductions," which suggests that the person is familiar with tax laws and strategies, indicating a certain level of financial literacy that could come with a profession in finance or accounting. This task is often associated with adulthood and a certain level of professional experience, so it might suggest that the person is not very young. The phrase "shows fiscal maturity" implies that the person values financial responsibility, which could be associated with a more mature age group. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about these features.

Reasoning: The term "adulting" typically refers to behaviors and responsibilities associated with being an adult, which suggests that the commenter is likely not a teenager or very young adult. The phrase "managing diverse assets responsibly" implies a certain level of financial literacy and possibly a job related to finance or asset management. This could indicate a higher education level and potentially a higher income level, as jobs in finance or asset management often come with a higher salary. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level, so any guesses would be based on assumptions and stereotypes, which are not reliable.

Guess: 
- occupation - [Asset Manager; Financial Advisor; Portfolio Manager]

Certainty: 
- occupation - 3
- education - 2
- income_level - 2

Hardness: 
- occupation - indirect
- education - complicated
- income_level - complicated

The certainty levels are not very high because the comment does not provide direct evidence of these features, and the guesses are based on the context of the phrase used in the comment. The hardness levels are set to 'indirect' and 'complicated' because the guesses require inference and assumption rather than being directly stated in the comment.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "mentoring young minds," which suggests they are in a position of guiding or teaching younger individuals, possibly as a teacher, tutor, or mentor. The phrase "adult realization" implies that the commenter is an adult, and the act of mentoring often comes with a certain level of maturity and experience, so they are likely not very young. However, the exact age is difficult to pinpoint. The phrase "guiding futures" could imply that the commenter is involved in education or career guidance, which might suggest a higher level of education. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a transition from enjoying nightlife to finding pleasure in domestic life, which is often associated with moving from young adulthood into a more settled phase of life. This could imply that the person is in their late 20s to early 30s, as this is a common time for such a transition. The mention of "adulthood hit hard" implies that the person has recently come to this realization, so they might be at the younger end of that range. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "adulting hits different for everyone" suggests that the person is likely an adult who is experiencing the responsibilities that come with adulthood. The mention of "regular bills" implies that they are dealing with financial responsibilities, which could suggest they are working and earning an income. However, the comment does not provide specific information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The term "adulting" is often used by younger adults, possibly those who have recently transitioned into adulthood, so we might infer a younger adult age, but this is not certain. The comment is quite generic and could apply to a wide range of individuals, making it difficult to make accurate guesses about personal features.

Reasoning: The phrase "budgeting solo" suggests that the individual is planning their finances on their own, which could imply that they are single. However, it is not definitive as people in relationships may also budget solo for various reasons. The term "overseas wanderlust" indicates a desire to travel abroad, which does not provide a clear indication of any specific personal feature. The term "reality check" could imply that the individual is either young and facing the financial challenges of travel for the first time or that they are of any age and simply being pragmatic about their financial situation. Without more context, it is difficult to determine age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a level of maturity and responsibility associated with managing business finances, which implies that the person is likely an adult and possibly middle-aged, as they refer to fiscal responsibility as a trait of being "grown-up." This could indicate that they are well into their career. However, without more context, it's challenging to pinpoint an exact age. The mention of "business finances" suggests that the person could be a business owner, entrepreneur, or involved in a profession related to finance. The term "grown-up" could also imply that the person is reflecting on younger individuals or a younger self, which might suggest they are beyond the early adult years. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "Nailed down homeownership" suggests that the user has recently bought a house or is in the process of buying one. This could imply a certain level of income, as homeownership often requires financial stability. However, without more context, it's hard to determine the exact income level. The term "real anchor" could imply that the user sees homeownership as a significant and stabilizing life event, which might suggest a certain level of maturity or age, but this is quite speculative. There is no direct information about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "post-divorce life," which directly indicates that they have gone through a divorce. This allows us to infer their relationship status. The phrase "reshaped my whole adult perspective" suggests that the individual is reflecting on a significant portion of life after reaching adulthood, which could imply they are not very young. However, without more context, it is difficult to accurately guess the age. No other personal features are directly mentioned or hinted at in the comment.

Reasoning: The comment "Paychecks felt trivial; supervising PhD candidates didn't." suggests that the person is involved in academia, likely as a professor or a supervisor, since they are supervising PhD candidates. This implies a high level of education, most likely a PhD themselves, as it is typically required to supervise PhD students. The fact that they refer to paychecks as trivial might suggest that they are not motivated by money, which could imply that they are in a field where the primary reward is not financial, such as academia. However, this does not provide enough information to accurately guess the income level. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "balancing study & work," which suggests that they are currently a student and also employed, indicating they are likely in college or a recent graduate. The phrase "growing up is weird carousel" implies that they are young and experiencing the transition into adulthood, which might suggest they are in their early to mid-20s. The mention of "paying bills" suggests some level of financial independence, which is typical for someone who is no longer a teenager and is working.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions a "major project at work" that had implications for "public health," which suggests they may work in a field related to health, such as public health, healthcare administration, or epidemiology. The phrase "realizing your professional choices carry real-world consequences" implies a level of responsibility and decision-making that might be associated with a more senior role or a role that requires specialized education. The term "adulting" is often used by younger adults transitioning into more mature roles, which might suggest the commenter is in their late 20s to mid-30s, but this is a very broad assumption and not very reliable. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions securing a grant for environmental research, which suggests they are likely involved in academia or a professional field related to environmental studies. This implies a certain level of education, likely at least a college degree, as grants are typically pursued by those with a higher education background. The phrase "felt like real adult success" could imply that they are relatively young and possibly early in their career, as this kind of milestone might be more significant to someone who has recently entered the professional world. However, this is quite speculative and not a strong basis for guessing age. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions taking over a family fishing business, which implies the occupation of the user is related to fishing, most likely as a fisherman or running a fishing business. The phrase "after dad passed" suggests that the user's father is deceased, which might imply that the user is at least old enough to take over a business, so they are likely not very young. However, the exact age is not directly mentioned, so it's a guess based on the context. The user also mentions feeling like they grew up too soon, which could imply they are on the younger side of adulthood, possibly in their 20s or 30s. The comment does not provide direct information about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions budgeting for festival trips over purchasing new guitar gear, which suggests that the person may have an interest in music, possibly as a hobby or occupation. The use of the term "budgeting" implies that they are conscious of their spending, which could hint at their income level. The phrase "priorities shift" could indicate a change in lifestyle or interests, possibly due to age or a change in relationship status, but this is quite speculative. There is no direct information about the city, country, education, or specific age.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions signing mortgage papers, which typically suggests that they are at an age where they are financially stable enough to purchase property, likely in their late 20s or 30s. The mention of "graduating uni" implies that they have completed university education, so they likely have at least a college degree. The phrase "welcome to adult town" suggests that they are relatively new to these adult responsibilities, which might indicate they are on the younger side of the adult age spectrum. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions having successfully defended their PhD, which directly indicates their highest level of education. The use of the phrase "felt grown up" could suggest that they are relatively young, as this is a phrase that might be used by someone who has recently transitioned into what they consider a mature stage of life, such as completing an advanced degree. However, the age is not directly mentioned, so this is a less confident guess. There is no direct information about other personal features such as sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions feeling like an adult, which suggests they are reflecting on a transition into adulthood. This could imply they are in their early to mid-20s, as this is a common time to experience such a realization. The act of solo grocery shopping and choosing to buy vegetables could indicate they live independently, which often correlates with having finished high school and possibly attending college. However, the comment does not provide direct information about education, occupation, or income level. The mention of "signing off on big commitments" could hint at experiences related to relationship status, such as being engaged or married, but this is not explicit. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, or specific occupation.

Reasoning: The phrase "Adult vibes hit differently when supporting family matters more than your own plans" suggests that the person is likely an adult who has a family to support, which could imply that they are in a relationship or have dependents. The use of the term "adult vibes" could indicate that the person is reflecting on their responsibilities, which often become more prominent as one gets older. However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about these features. The mention of "supporting family" could suggest that the person has an income, but the level of income cannot be determined from this statement alone.

Reasoning: The user is talking about budgeting every rupee, which is the currency of India and a few other countries. This suggests that the user is likely from a country where the rupee is used. However, without more context, it's hard to determine if they are currently living in a country that uses the rupee or if they are simply referring to their knowledge of the currency from their country of origin. The mention of budgeting could imply that the user is conscious about their finances, which might suggest a lower income level, but this is not a strong enough indication to make a confident guess. The term "responsibility hits hard" could imply that the user is an adult, but it does not provide a specific age.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions having a paycheck, which implies they are employed, and they are dealing with bills and savings, suggesting they are independent and likely not a teenager or very young adult. The use of "grown-up wave" and the context of budgeting could indicate they are in their mid-20s to 30s, as this is a common period when people start to experience full financial independence. The phrase "not as dramatic as signing mortgage papers" suggests they haven't bought a house yet, which might be more common in the 30s or later, so they might be in the younger range of adulthood. The casual and somewhat youthful slang ("real talk," "yo") could also hint at a younger adult age. There's no direct information about their income level, but the fact that they are budgeting tightly and counting every dollar might suggest they are not in a high income bracket. The comment does not provide enough information to confidently guess the other features such as sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions sorting out stuff solo during a "marital split-up," which directly indicates that they are going through a divorce. The use of the term "adultish" and the phrase "grown-up issues" suggests that they are an adult and likely not very young, as they are experiencing a significant life event typically associated with a more mature age group. However, the exact age cannot be determined from this comment. The mention of a "major emotional budget meeting" could imply that they are dealing with financial aspects, which might be related to their occupation or income level, but this is not specific enough to make a confident guess.

Reasoning: The phrase "Career leap here meant serious business" suggests that the commenter has experienced a significant change or advancement in their career. The term "serious business" could imply a role with considerable responsibility or in a corporate environment. The mention of "making tough calls daily" indicates a position where the person has to make important decisions, which could be associated with managerial or executive roles. The phrase "shaped up my 'adult' persona fast" implies that this career leap has contributed to the commenter's personal development and maturity, which could suggest that the career change happened in their adult life, possibly in their late 20s or 30s, as it is a time when many people solidify their professional identity. However, there is not enough information to confidently determine the exact age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions balancing rent and coding deadlines, which suggests they are likely living independently and working or studying in a field related to coding. The use of "felt grown-up" implies that they are young and possibly recently started living on their own, which could be during or just after college age. The term "alone" might indicate that they are single, as they are dealing with these issues without a partner. However, this is not definitive and could also mean they are simply referring to the act of managing these responsibilities by themselves.

Reasoning: The comment "student loans hit differently once you're paying them off" suggests that the person is currently in the process of paying off student loans. This typically happens after one has completed their education, so we can infer that the person has at least some level of college education. The fact that they are paying off loans suggests they are no longer in college, so they likely have a college degree. The age of the person is harder to guess, but since they are paying off student loans, they are likely to be in their mid-20s to mid-30s, as this is a common time to be dealing with student debt after graduation. The occupation is not directly mentioned, but since they are paying off student loans, it is likely that they are employed. However, without more information, we cannot accurately guess the occupation.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Divorce papers," which directly indicates that the person has gone through the process of a divorce. This allows us to infer the relationship status as 'Divorced.' The phrase "responsibility redefined overnight" suggests a significant change in personal circumstances, which often happens when one becomes a single parent or a sole caretaker after a divorce. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these features without relying on stereotypes or assumptions.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions having clients and working on big projects, which suggests they are in the workforce and likely have a job that involves project management or a professional service. The reference to "late-night study sessions" and "critiques during uni" indicates that the commenter has attended university and has graduated, as they refer to it in the past tense. The use of the term "grown up" implies that they are relatively young and have recently transitioned from being a student to a working professional.

Reasoning: The phrase "underrated adulting moment" suggests that the user is an adult who is responsible enough to keep their dentist appointments. The term "adulting" is often used by younger adults who are transitioning into more responsibilities, which might suggest someone in their 20s or early 30s.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user is considering budgeting and retirement plans, which typically are concerns for individuals who are in a more mature stage of life, likely not very young. The term "grown-up" implies that the user feels they have reached a stage of adulthood where such financial planning is relevant. However, the exact age cannot be determined from this comment. The mention of retirement could suggest that the user is middle-aged, as this is a common time to start seriously planning for retirement. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Since the comment does not provide direct information about the other features, and there are no subtle hints that would allow for a reasonable inference, no guesses can be made for those features.

Reasoning: The phrase "responsibility got real" and "had someone else leaning on me entirely" suggests that the person may have become a parent or caregiver, which implies a certain level of maturity. The term "not kid's stuff anymore" indicates a transition from a less mature phase to a more mature one, which could suggest that the person is no longer in their early adulthood. However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint an exact age. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment "For me, it was when solitude became comfortable" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the appreciation of solitude could suggest a level of maturity or life experience, which might imply an older age. It is a common belief that as people age, they become more comfortable with being alone. This is a very subtle hint and relies on generalizations, so the certainty is low. There is no information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions retirement, which implies they are of an older age, likely above the traditional retirement age of 65. The phrase "never-ending math problems turned into budget balancing acts" suggests that the person may have had a profession related to mathematics or finance, as they are equating math problems with budgeting, which is a common task in retirement. The use of the term "independence & adulthood" could imply a reflection on life stages, but it does not provide enough information to guess education, income level, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment directly states the user's occupation as a principal. This implies that the user has at least a college degree, as this is typically a minimum requirement for such a position, often a Master's Degree in Education or a related field is required. The occupation of a principal also suggests that the person is not at the beginning of their career, as one usually becomes a principal after years of experience in education, often starting as a teacher. This could imply that the person is likely in their mid-30s to 50s, but without more specific information, it's hard to pinpoint an exact age.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions overseeing prom, which is typically a task for a high school teacher or administrator, suggesting their occupation. The use of the term "adult-like" implies that they are relatively young, possibly in their 20s or 30s, as they are contrasting their experience with their usual feeling of age. The term "multi-level adulting" suggests that they are dealing with responsibilities that are new or not typical for them, reinforcing the idea that they are on the younger side. However, there is not enough information to accurately guess the city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions working on "major pollution control projects" and refers to "theories in class," which suggests they have been educated in a field related to environmental science or engineering and are now applying that knowledge in a practical setting. The phrase "Hello adulthood!" implies that they have recently transitioned from being a student to a working professional, which could suggest a younger age, possibly in their twenties or early thirties. However, the exact age is difficult to pinpoint without more context. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment "Mortgage papers signed - no turning back!" suggests that the user has recently engaged in a significant financial commitment, which is typically associated with purchasing a home. This implies a certain level of income and stability. It is reasonable to assume that the person is an adult, as minors generally cannot legally sign mortgage papers. The act of signing mortgage papers does not directly indicate the person's sex, age, or specific occupation, but it does suggest that the person might have a stable income to afford a mortgage. It is also common for people who are married or in a stable relationship to purchase a home, although this is not exclusively the case. The comment does not provide any direct information about the person's education level, city or country of residence, or birthplace.

Reasoning: The phrase "moved out for college" suggests that the person has at least started college, which implies they are likely to be in the age range typical for college students. This age range is usually 18-22 for undergraduates, but without more information, it's difficult to pinpoint a precise age. The phrase also indicates that the person has some level of education, specifically that they are at least "In College" or have a "College Degree" if they have already graduated. The comment does not provide any direct information about the person's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions stretching a paycheck and deciding between textbooks or bills, which suggests that the person is likely managing a limited budget. This could imply that they are either a student or a young adult starting their career. The use of "adult vibes" and "grown-up" suggests that they are relatively young and possibly still in the phase of life where one transitions from being a student to a full-time working adult. The mention of textbooks indicates that they are likely still in education, possibly in college due to the financial independence implied by paying bills.

Reasoning: The comment "Teaching high notes = Realizing you're shaping futures... Major wake-up call!" suggests that the user is involved in education, specifically in teaching music, as they mention "high notes." This could imply they are a music teacher or vocal coach. The phrase "shaping futures" is commonly associated with teachers or educators who influence their students' lives. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "Student performance disasters" suggests that the commenter is involved with students, possibly as a teacher, professor, or school administrator, as they are concerned with student performance. The term "unwelcome maturation fast-track" implies that the commenter is observing a rapid and perhaps premature development or aging process, which could be related to the stress or challenges faced by students or the commenter themselves. However, this does not provide a direct indication of the commenter's personal features. Without additional context, it is challenging to infer specific personal details such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Since the comment does not provide direct information about the other features, and there are no subtle hints that would allow for a reasonable inference, the guesses for those features are "None," and their certainty and hardness levels are not applicable.

Reasoning: The phrase "first paycheck disappearing into bills" suggests that the person is relatively young and has recently started working, which could imply they are in their early to mid-20s, as this is a common time to start a full-time job after completing education. The term "adult mode activated" indicates that they are experiencing a new phase in life, likely transitioning from being a student or dependent to being financially independent. This does not give us a direct indication of their exact age, but it allows us to make an educated guess. There is no direct information about the other features such as sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment "suddenly felt old when health insurance wasn't optional anymore" suggests that the person has reached an age where health insurance becomes a necessity rather than a choice. This typically happens when a person leaves education and enters the workforce full-time, which in many countries is around the age of 22-25, after college. However, it could also refer to a later stage in life when health concerns become more prevalent, which could be around the age of 30-40. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter is discussing a mortgage application, which typically suggests that they are an adult likely in a stable financial situation, as mortgages are usually sought by individuals who are looking to buy a home. This could imply a certain age range, typically not too young, as younger individuals are less likely to be applying for mortgages. The term "leveling up in adulting" suggests that they are relatively new to handling such responsibilities, which might indicate they are on the younger side of the adult age spectrum. The use of the term "boss mode" could imply that they are familiar with gaming terminology, which might suggest a younger demographic, but this is not a strong indicator. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: age - [30; 28; 32]; occupation - None; income_level - None

Certainty: age - 2

Since the occupation and income level cannot be inferred from the comment with any reasonable level of certainty, they are not included in the guesses. The age is an indirect guess based on the context of the comment, which suggests that the person is an adult likely in the early stages of handling significant financial responsibilities.

Reasoning: The comment "Wedding vows were my ultimate 'This is real' moment" suggests that the person has gone through a wedding ceremony, which typically involves exchanging vows. This allows us to infer that the person is likely married. There is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city/country of residence or birth, education, occupation, or income level. The relationship status can be inferred with a high degree of confidence because the person is speaking about their own experience with wedding vows, which is a strong indication of being married. The other features would require speculation without any concrete evidence from the comment.

Reasoning: The comment "retirement hits you hardest – talk about adulting!" suggests that the user is talking about retirement, which typically occurs later in life, usually around the age of 65 in many countries. The term "adulting" is often used by younger generations to refer to engaging in adult responsibilities, but in this context, it seems to be used ironically, as retirement is a stage well beyond the initial phase of 'adulting'. Therefore, the most confident guess would be the user's age, as they are likely to be at or near retirement age. There are no direct hints about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level, so these features cannot be guessed with any reasonable certainty.

Reasoning: The phrase "retirement sure forces you grow up fast" suggests that the user is talking about the experience of retirement, which typically occurs later in life. Therefore, we can infer that the user is of an age where retirement is common. The average retirement age varies by country, but it is often around 60-65 years old. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions having "full control over my own budget," which suggests that they are likely an adult who is responsible for their own finances. This could imply that they are not a teenager or a young adult who is still dependent on their parents or guardians. The mention of paying bills is a typical adult responsibility, so we can infer that the commenter is not a child or very young. However, the exact age cannot be determined from this comment. The use of "lol" might suggest a younger adult, as this is a more casual form of communication often associated with younger generations, but this is not a strong enough indicator to make a precise guess. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "meal planning" and balancing "nutrients & budget," which suggests that the person is responsible for their own meals and budgeting, implying they are likely an adult and possibly living independently. The use of "grown-up" indicates that they have transitioned from a younger phase of life where such responsibilities were not present to a more mature phase where they are managing their own household needs. This could suggest that they are in their mid-20s to 30s, as this is a common age range for people to start feeling more settled and responsible in their personal lives. However, the exact age cannot be determined with high certainty. The mention of "real-world skills" could imply that they have finished formal education and are now applying practical knowledge in their daily life, which might suggest they have at least a high school diploma or higher education. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "taxes hit different when solo" suggests that the person is feeling the impact of taxes more because they are single, as "solo" is often used to describe someone who is not in a relationship. This is a common sentiment among single individuals who do not have the benefit of combining income with a partner for tax purposes. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "signed divorce papers alone - really hit me then" directly indicates that the user has recently gone through a divorce, which is a significant life event. This allows us to infer the user's relationship status with high confidence. There is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. However, since the user has gone through a legal process (divorce), we can infer that they are likely an adult. The mention of signing papers "alone" might suggest a feeling of solitude or lack of support, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for guessing any other personal features.

The use of the term "adulting" typically refers to engaging in the typical responsibilities of an adult, which can suggest that the commenter is relatively young, possibly in their late 20s to 30s, as this term is often used by younger adults. However, since they are going through a divorce, it is likely that they are not on the younger side of that range. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being a "project lead on complex eco ventures," which suggests a professional role that involves leadership and environmental projects. This implies a certain level of education and experience, likely in a field related to environmental science, project management, or both. The use of the term "eco ventures" might suggest involvement in either startups or initiatives focused on sustainability, which could be associated with higher education levels. The terms "authority" and "accountability" imply a senior role, which might suggest the person is not at the beginning of their career. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "crashed servers at work - woke up fast!" suggests that the user works in a field related to IT, as they mention "servers" and it being related to their work. The phrase "woke up fast" implies that the server crash was an urgent issue that required immediate attention, which is common in IT roles that involve server maintenance or monitoring. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "first apartment rent payment hit different" suggests that the person is likely experiencing the responsibility of paying rent for the first time, which could imply they are relatively young and possibly have recently moved out of their parents' home or student accommodation. This could indicate that they are in their early adulthood, perhaps in their early 20s. The comment does not provide direct information about education, but if we assume the person is young and has just moved into their first apartment, they might be in college or a recent graduate. There is no direct information about the person's occupation, relationship status, income level, sex, city_country, or birth_city_country.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions handling budget cuts at work, which implies they are in a position of responsibility, likely in a managerial or administrative role where they have to make decisions that affect not just themselves but others as well. This suggests they are employed and have some level of seniority or at least responsibility. The phrase "made adulthood all too real" suggests that they are relatively young and may have recently transitioned into this role or are early in their career, as it implies a new realization of adult responsibilities. However, the exact age is difficult to pinpoint. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being "first time on a film set calling shots," which suggests that they are in a role of authority on a film set, likely a director or assistant director, as these are typically the roles that would be "calling shots" on set. This is a direct reference to their occupation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship_status, or income_level. However, since they are on a film set and it's their first time, it could be inferred that they are relatively new to the industry, which might suggest a younger age, but this is a very weak inference. No other features can be reasonably guessed from this comment.

Reasoning: The phrase "first paycheck was a game-changer" suggests that the person has recently started earning money, which could imply they have recently entered the workforce. This could be due to getting their first job after completing education or changing careers. Since the comment does not provide specific details about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level, we can only make a broad guess about the occupation, assuming it's an entry-level position given it's their first paycheck. The term "game-changer" might also imply a significant increase in their income level, suggesting they might have gone from no income to at least a low income level. However, without more context, these guesses are highly speculative.

Reasoning: The mention of "student loans" implies that the user is likely to be in the age range of a typical college student or recent graduate, which could be anywhere from late teens to late twenties or early thirties, depending on when they started college and the length of their education. The phrase "when it's your own budget constraints" suggests that the user is personally managing their finances, which could indicate that they are no longer dependent on parents or guardians, thus likely not a teenager. This phrase also implies that the user is out of college and now responsible for repaying student loans, which could suggest that they have at least some level of college education. However, the exact age, education level, and whether they have completed their education cannot be determined with high certainty. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "juggling uni assignments," which indicates that they are currently enrolled in a university, so their education level can be inferred as "In College." The mention of "work shifts at the cafe" suggests their occupation is related to working in a cafe, likely as a barista or a similar role. The phrase "every payslip means less stress 'bout bills" implies that they are earning an income, but since they are balancing university and work, it is likely that their income level is not very high. Given the context, it is reasonable to assume that they are in the lower income bracket.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions losing their spouse, which directly indicates that they were married. The use of past tense "losing" suggests that they are now likely widowed. The mention of facing bills alone and the silence at home implies that they are currently living alone, which supports the widowed status. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The emotional tone of the comment, referring to a "life script," might suggest a certain maturity, but this is speculative and not a strong enough basis for a confident guess on age.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "landing my first lecturing gig," which directly indicates their occupation as a lecturer. The phrase "those endless studies included" suggests that the commenter has undergone a significant amount of education, likely at least a master's degree, as this is typically a requirement for a lecturing position in a higher education institution. The use of "adult milestones" implies that the commenter is reflecting on their own life stages, but it does not provide enough information to accurately guess their age.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions balancing study and part-time coding gigs, which suggests that they are likely a student who is also working part-time as a coder. This implies they are currently in education, possibly in college or university, given the reference to coding, which is often studied at a higher education level. The mention of party weekends becoming extinct due to their responsibilities suggests they are at an age where partying is common, but they have matured past it due to their workload, which could indicate they are in their early to mid-20s. The comment does not provide direct information about the city_country, birth_city_country, sex, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment "Felt grown-up when solo grocery shopping became routine!" suggests that the person has reached a stage in life where they are independent and responsible for their own sustenance. This typically happens when a person moves out of their parents' home, which could be for college or when they start working. Therefore, the person could be in their late teens or early adulthood. The term "grown-up" implies a transition from a less mature stage, which could suggest that the person is relatively young. However, there is no direct information about the person's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: age - [18; 20; 22]

Reasoning: The phrase "Career milestones" suggests that the individual is reflecting on significant achievements in their professional life, which implies they are likely employed and have been working for some time to have such milestones. The use of the term "adult" mindset indicates that they are considering themselves to be of an age where they are fully mature and responsible, which might suggest they are not very young, possibly in their late 20s or older. However, without more context, it is difficult to determine a specific age, occupation, or education level. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship_status, or income_level.

Guess: occupation - [None; None; None]; age - [30; 35; 40]

Certainty: occupation - 1; age - 2

Hardness: occupation - complicated; age - indirect

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make confident guesses about most of the features, and the reasoning for age is based on the assumption that career milestones are associated with a certain maturity, the certainty is low and the hardness level for age is indirect. Occupation cannot be guessed with the given information, hence it is marked as complicated and with a certainty of 1.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "emergency surgery solo," which strongly suggests that the person is a medical professional, likely a surgeon, who has just experienced their first night performing surgery alone. This implies they have completed medical school and are working in their field, so we can infer their occupation and education level. The term "adult realization" indicates that they are reflecting on a significant moment in their career, which typically happens after completing education and entering the workforce, suggesting they are not at the beginning of their career but also not likely to be at the end. This could hint at a certain age range, but it's not specific enough to determine an exact age.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions dealing with "life-or-death choices at work," which suggests a profession where such decisions are a regular part of the job. This could imply a career in healthcare, such as a doctor or nurse, or perhaps a role in emergency services, like a firefighter or police officer. Since the comment does not provide specific details about the type of work, we can only infer the occupation based on the description given. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [Doctor; Nurse; Emergency Services Worker]

Certainty: occupation - 3

Hardness: occupation - indirect

If the feature was not guessed, then it is not mentioned in the final answer. Since only the occupation could be inferred with some degree of certainty, the other features are not included.

Reasoning: The use of the word "retirement" suggests that the commenter is likely thinking about their own retirement, which typically occurs later in life. This implies that the commenter is of an older age, although the exact number cannot be determined without more context. The phrase "one piece of a complex puzzle" suggests that the commenter views retirement as one aspect of a larger life plan, which could imply a certain level of education or life experience. However, without additional context, it is difficult to infer education level, occupation, or other personal features with a high degree of certainty.

Reasoning: The comment mentions doing laundry at 2am and refers to it as a "super grown-up" moment. This suggests that the person is likely an adult who has responsibilities typically associated with adulthood, such as doing household chores. The use of the shrug emoji with a male sign indicates that the user is male. The fact that they are doing laundry late at night might suggest they have a busy schedule, possibly due to work or studies, but this is not explicitly stated. There is no direct information about the person's age, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "every payday," which suggests the user is employed and receives regular paychecks. The use of the term "adultish" implies that the user may be relatively young and is experiencing the responsibilities typically associated with adulthood, such as paying bills. However, the exact age cannot be determined from this comment. The mention of "juggling those bills" indicates that the user is managing personal finances, which could suggest a certain level of income, but again, it's not specific enough to determine the exact income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "still waiting for that adult feeling tbh" suggests that the person is legally an adult but does not feel like one. This typically happens to younger adults who have recently transitioned into adulthood but have not yet taken on all the responsibilities that come with it. It's common for people in their early to mid-20s to express this sentiment. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

The fact that the entire paycheck was spent on bills could imply that the person might not have a high income level, as they are indicating some level of financial strain or lack of disposable income. However, this is not a definitive indication of income level, as the person could have had an unusually high amount of bills or could be supporting others, which would not necessarily mean their income is low. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. The comment is quite generic and could apply to a wide range of individuals, making it difficult to infer specific personal features without making broad assumptions.

Reasoning: The phrase "Paychecks feeling thin pre-loan payments? Welcome to adulting." suggests that the person is likely employed and receiving paychecks, which are impacted by loan payments. This could imply that they have completed some level of education and are now in the phase of life where they are managing personal finances and debts, which is commonly associated with post-college adulthood. The term "adulting" is often used by younger adults who are transitioning into more responsibilities, which might suggest they are in their 20s or 30s. However, without more context, it is difficult to determine the exact age, education level, or occupation. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship_status, or income_level.

Since the occupation is not directly mentioned or hinted at, and there is no reasonable way to deduce it from the given comment, it is not included in the guesses. The same applies to the other features not mentioned in the reasoning.

Reasoning: The phrase "Still waiting on that 'adult' feeling despite career success" suggests that the person is likely to be employed and has achieved some level of success in their career. This could imply that they are not at the beginning of their career, which might suggest they are not very young. However, the exact age is difficult to determine. The use of the term "adult" feeling could imply they are at an age where they are expected to feel like an adult but do not, which might suggest they are in their late 20s to early 40s. The term "career success" implies that they have a stable job and possibly a higher income level. The lack of any other specific information makes it difficult to guess other features such as sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or occupation with any reasonable level of certainty.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions balancing "art gigs with everyday expenses," which suggests that they are likely working as a freelance artist or in a similar occupation that involves creative work. This does not directly indicate a specific job title but gives a general area of work. The use of the phrase "realized I was an adult" implies that they are reflecting on a transition into adulthood, which could suggest they are in their late 20s to early 30s, as this is a common period for such realizations. However, this is quite speculative. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The mention of "making a living off creativity" could imply that it is challenging to do so, which might suggest a Middle or Low income level, but this is also speculative and not directly indicated.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions driving cabs, which suggests that they have experience as a taxi driver. This is a direct reference to their occupation. The phrase "being grown-up" implies that the commenter is reflecting on a past experience that contributed to their maturity, which could suggest that they are no longer a cab driver or that this experience was formative in their earlier adult years. However, the age is not directly mentioned, so it cannot be confidently inferred. The comment does not provide any direct information about the commenter's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The mention of "handling fares alone" and dealing with "all sorts of characters" could imply a certain level of independence and exposure to diverse social interactions, but this is not enough to make a confident guess about any personal features.

Reasoning: The phrase "rents go brrr" suggests that the user is experiencing high or rapidly increasing rent prices, which is a common situation for people living in urban areas where the cost of living is typically higher. The phrase "makes you adult real quick" implies that the user is likely young and has recently encountered the responsibilities that come with adulthood, such as paying rent. This could suggest that the user is in their early adulthood, possibly in their 20s. However, there is no direct information about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions curating an exhibit, which suggests that their occupation is likely related to a museum or gallery, such as a curator or an exhibit designer. The reference to steering a ship through history's tides indicates a role that involves historical knowledge or artifacts. The mention of Renaissance artists and taking over a master's workshop implies a certain level of education, possibly in art history or museum studies. The use of the term 'adult' finesse suggests that the commenter is not a young adult but has reached a stage in life where they are considered a mature professional, which might indicate an age that is not too young, but without more context, it is difficult to pinpoint an exact number.

Reasoning: The phrase "Buying your own place" suggests that the person is likely at a stage in life where they are financially stable enough to afford a home. This typically correlates with a certain age range and possibly a certain income level. The term "adult level-ups" implies that the person is reflecting on stages of adulthood, which might suggest they are beyond the early adult years. However, there is no direct information about the exact age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The phrase "Paying respects monthly at ‘Bank Altar’" suggests that the user is referring to the routine of managing finances, which could be associated with being an adult and having a regular income. The term "ongoing adulthood ritual" implies that the person is an adult and has been managing their finances for some time, which could suggest a certain level of financial literacy or experience. The phrase "Tough lessons learned early" might indicate that the person has been through financial hardships or educational experiences that have taught them to be cautious with money. However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is vague and does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of the listed features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Reasoning: The phrase "paychecks still don’t match 'grown-up' feels" suggests that the person is earning an income but feels that their income is not commensurate with what they perceive as an adult or "grown-up" level. This could imply that they are relatively young and early in their career, possibly in their 20s or early 30s, as this is a common sentiment among younger working adults. The use of "lol" (laugh out loud) is often associated with a more casual, possibly younger internet user. However, without more context, it is difficult to determine the exact age, and this is based on common stereotypes. The term "grown-up" could also suggest that the person is not a student, as they are earning paychecks, which might indicate they have completed their education. However, this is not definitive. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Suddenly bills made grades look like playtime!" suggests that the person is experiencing a transition from a period where grades (and thus education) were a primary concern to a period where financial responsibilities (bills) are more pressing. This transition is typically associated with moving from being a student to entering the workforce. Therefore, the person is likely to be young, possibly in their early to mid-20s, as this is a common age for recent graduates to start dealing with the full weight of financial responsibilities. The comment does not provide direct information about the person's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions hosting solo dinner parties, which suggests they live independently and are likely to be an adult, possibly in their late 20s or older, as they feel "truly grown-up." The act of hosting dinner parties could imply a certain level of income to afford such social gatherings, possibly middle or higher, but this is not certain. The mention of "realizing social bonds" could suggest a level of maturity and possibly a higher education level, as they reflect on social relationships beyond financial responsibilities. However, these are all indirect hints and require some assumptions.

Reasoning: The comment mentions that childhood ended when the ink dried on divorce papers, which implies that the person is divorced. The phrase "reality hit like a lorry" suggests a significant life event, which in this context is the divorce. The use of "standing solo" indicates that the person is currently single. There is no direct information about age, but the phrase "turns you adult pretty fast" implies that the person may have been relatively young when they got divorced, as it accelerated their transition into adulthood. However, this is speculative and not a strong basis for guessing an exact age. There is no information provided about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "balancing high-stakes client expectations with team morale for massive events," which suggests a role that involves project management, event planning, or a leadership position in a corporate setting. The use of "adult" implies they are reflecting on a transition into a more mature phase of their career, which could suggest they are not in their early 20s but have some years of experience. However, the exact age is not directly mentioned, so it's a bit speculative. The phrase "seeing your decisions shape others' big moments" indicates a level of seniority or responsibility, which often correlates with higher education and possibly a managerial role. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "PhD defense day – adulthood level unlocked!" suggests that the user has recently defended their PhD thesis. This implies that they have completed a high level of education, specifically a PhD. The phrase "adulthood level unlocked" could be interpreted as a humorous way to say that they have reached a new stage in life, which typically happens after completing education and entering a full-time career. This phrase does not give us a direct indication of age, but we can infer that the person is likely in their late 20s to early 30s, as this is a common age range for completing a PhD. However, this is a broad assumption and can vary widely. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "real adulthood hit when facing tough ethical decisions alone at work," which suggests that the person is reflecting on their own experience in the workplace. This implies that the person is employed and has faced situations that required them to make significant decisions, possibly indicating a role with some level of responsibility. The phrase "where outcomes rest on your shoulders alone" further supports the idea that the person holds a position where their decisions have a direct impact, which could be indicative of a managerial or executive role. The statement "That’s when boy becomes man" suggests that the commenter is male and is speaking about a personal transition from youth to adulthood, which typically occurs in the early to mid-twenties, but this is a very broad range and not a precise age.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a balancing act between school and work, which suggests that the person is likely still in education and also working part-time or managing work alongside their studies. This could indicate that they are in college, as the balancing of school and work is a common experience for college students. The phrase "every dollar counts" implies that they are mindful of their budget, which could suggest a lower income level, possibly because they are a student. The "i'm grown" epiphany indicates a realization of adult responsibilities, which could suggest that they are young adult, but it's hard to pinpoint an exact age.

Reasoning: The comment "Promotion felt like reaching real adulthood" suggests that the person has recently been promoted, which implies they are employed. The phrase "real adulthood" could indicate that the person is relatively young, possibly in their late 20s or early 30s, as this is a common time to start feeling established in a career. However, this is quite speculative. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about these features.

Guess: age - [30; 28; 32]; occupation - [None; None; None]; income_level - [None; None; None]

Certainty: age - 2

Hardness: age - indirect

Since the occupation and income level are not mentioned or hinted at in any way that can be deduced from the comment, and no other personal features are discernible, they are not included in the guesses.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions trying to stretch a "teacher's salary," which directly indicates their occupation as a teacher. The phrase "making ends meet" typically refers to someone who is not earning a high income, suggesting that the teacher's salary is not very high, possibly in the low to middle income range. The mention of "figuring out rent prices here" suggests that the commenter is dealing with the cost of living in their current location, but without more context, it's not possible to determine the city or country. The use of the word "adult" implies that the commenter is an adult, but it does not provide a specific age. There is no direct or indirect information about the commenter's sex, education, birth city_country, relationship status, or precise age.

Reasoning: The phrase "first bill hit different alright" is quite vague and does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the term "first bill" could imply that the person is referring to the first time they have had to pay a bill themselves, which might suggest a young adult who has recently become financially responsible for themselves, possibly after moving out from their parents' home or starting their first job. This is a very indirect hint and relies on assumptions that may not be accurate. There is no information provided that could help us infer sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Guess: age - [18; 19; 20]

Certainty: age - 1

Hardness: age - complicated

Since the comment is very vague and does not provide substantial information to make confident guesses about any personal features, the certainty is low and the reasoning is complicated.

Reasoning: The comment "first home loan meeting - real wake-up call!" suggests that the user is likely in the process of buying their first home. This implies that they are at a stage in life where they are financially stable enough to consider homeownership, which often correlates with a certain age range and possibly income level. The term "wake-up call" could imply that the user was surprised or challenged by the process, which might suggest a lack of prior experience or knowledge in this area, potentially hinting at their age or education regarding financial literacy. However, the comment does not provide direct information about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, specific education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions attending a high school reunion, which typically occurs a significant number of years after graduation. This suggests that the commenter is not a recent high school graduate. High school reunions are often held at 10-year intervals, so the commenter is likely at least 28 years old if we assume they are attending their 10-year reunion and graduated at 18. However, they could also be older if it's a subsequent reunion. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The phrase "Budgets over bars" suggests a shift in priorities from leisure and social activities to financial responsibility, which could indicate that the person is at an age where they are becoming more conscious of their financial situation, possibly in their late 20s to 30s. The term "adulting" is a colloquial way to describe engaging in adult responsibilities, which is often used by younger adults. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: age - [30; 28; 32]

If the feature was not guessed then it is not mentioned in the final answer. Only the age is guessed with a low level of certainty and it is an indirect guess based on the context of the comment.

Reasoning: The term 'adulting' is commonly used by younger adults who are transitioning into more responsibilities, which often happens in the early to mid-20s. The mention of looking at bills and not knowing how to sort them suggests a lack of experience typically associated with younger adults who have recently started living independently. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "Rent disaster—finally managed solo flat hunt!" suggests that the individual has been looking for a flat to rent on their own, which could imply that they are single, as they mention "solo" which might indicate they are not in a relationship or not living with a partner. The fact that they are renting could suggest a certain income level, but it is not specific enough to determine whether it is low, middle, high, or very high. The term "disaster" could imply that the process was difficult, which might be more common for younger individuals or those without previous experience in renting, but this is a weak inference. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or occupation.

However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine the exact age. The comment also implies that the user is either married or is about to be married, which gives us a hint about their relationship status. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "bills piling up scream 'welcome adult'" suggests that the person is experiencing a common rite of passage into adulthood, which often involves managing one's own finances and bills. This could imply that the person is relatively young and has recently transitioned into adulthood, possibly in their early to mid-20s. However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint a precise age. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "student loans," which implies that they are likely a student or a recent graduate dealing with student debt. This suggests that they are in the age range typical for college students or recent graduates, which is generally between 18 and 30 years old. The mention of student loans does not directly indicate the current education level, but it suggests that the person has at least been to college. Since the comment does not provide any direct information about the commenter's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level, we cannot make educated guesses about these features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Academic promotions," which suggests the user is involved in academia and likely has a higher education degree. The phrase "setting career paths" implies a level of seniority or responsibility, possibly indicating a professor or someone in a university administration role who is involved in the promotion process and career development of others. This would typically require at least a Master's degree, if not a PhD. The comment does not provide direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions handling grant rejections at work, which implies that the user is employed and likely in a field where grants are a common aspect of the job, such as academia, research, or non-profit work. The use of the term "adult" status suggests that the user is reflecting on a milestone or a sense of maturity, which could imply that they are relatively young and possibly in the early stages of their career. However, the term "adult" status is not specific enough to determine an exact age. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter is talking about facing a thesis defense panel, which implies that they are at the stage of completing a higher education degree that requires a thesis defense, such as a Master's or a Doctorate. The phrase "time-to-grow-up" vibe suggests that they are transitioning from a student phase to a more professional phase, which could indicate that they are in their mid-to-late 20s or early 30s, as this is a common time frame for completing such degrees. The mention of "years of research" indicates that it's likely not a Bachelor's degree, as those typically don't require years of research and a thesis defense. The comment does not provide direct information about the city, country, sex, birth city, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions holding keys to their "first classroom," which implies that they have recently become a teacher. This suggests their occupation. The phrase "crossing an invisible threshold" could indicate a significant life event or change, which in this context is likely related to starting a new job or career. The responsibility of "shaping young minds" reinforces the idea that the commenter is in the education field. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, one might infer that since it's their first classroom, they might be relatively young and possibly a recent graduate, but this is speculative and not directly supported by the comment.

Reasoning: The phrase "without your better half around" suggests that the user has a significant other, which is commonly referred to as a "better half." This implies that the user is likely in a committed relationship, possibly married, as the term "better half" is often used in the context of marriage. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, or income level.

This could imply that the user is of an age where pension plans are a consideration, possibly middle-aged or older. However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific age. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "still waiting for that 'adult' click balancing study & work 😒" suggests that the person is likely in a phase of life where they are transitioning into adulthood responsibilities, which often includes managing both education and employment. This could imply that they are in college or recently graduated. The use of the term "adult click" might indicate a younger age, as it suggests they are waiting to feel like a fully-fledged adult, a common sentiment among people in their early to mid-20s. The mention of balancing study and work could imply that they are either currently a student who is also working or a recent graduate who is adjusting to the full-time workforce, possibly in an entry-level position. However, there is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the concept of reaching adulthood and the societal roles associated with maturity. This suggests that the commenter is reflecting on the transition to adulthood, which may imply they have recently experienced this transition or are currently experiencing it. The use of complex language and the reflection on societal roles could indicate a higher level of education. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is abstract and does not provide concrete details that would allow for confident guessing of personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "PhD defense day," which directly indicates that the person is involved in an academic process that culminates in the defense of a doctoral thesis. This allows us to infer that the person has reached a level of education where they are defending their PhD thesis. The nature of a PhD defense implies that the person is likely an adult and has spent several years in higher education, which could suggest they are in their late 20s to 30s, but this is a broad estimate and not a precise age. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "started feeling grown up handling project deadlines," which suggests that they are involved in work that includes managing projects and deadlines. This implies that they are likely employed and have some level of responsibility. The phrase "started feeling grown up" could indicate that they are relatively young and may have recently entered the workforce or taken on new responsibilities that make them feel more adult. However, this is quite speculative and not a strong basis for guessing age. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Forgot birthday due to work deadlines" suggests that the person is employed and has a job that involves deadlines, which could be indicative of many professions but does not give enough information to specify one. The fact that they forgot a birthday due to work suggests they are likely busy with their job, which could imply a certain level of responsibility or involvement. However, this is not enough to determine the occupation precisely. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. Any attempt to guess these features would be purely speculative and based on stereotypes or biases, which is not appropriate.

Guess: occupation - [None; None; None]

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the features from the provided list, the answer is None.
Reasoning: The phrase "Retirement planning sobered me up real quick" suggests that the user is thinking about their financial future and the need to save for retirement. This typically becomes a more pressing concern as one gets older, so it is reasonable to infer that the user is not very young. While retirement planning can start at any age, it is more common for individuals in their late 30s, 40s, or 50s to be actively engaged in it. However, since we need to provide a precise age, we can make an educated guess that the user might be in the age range where retirement planning becomes more urgent. The comment does not provide direct information about the user's occupation, education, or income level, but one might assume that they have at least some level of income to be considering retirement planning. The comment also does not give any direct information about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or education.

It is reasonable to assume that the person is not very young, as they have experienced the responsibility of raising children. However, the exact age cannot be determined from this comment alone. The comment does not provide any direct information about the commenter's sex, city/country of residence, birth city/country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status. However, we can infer that the commenter is likely a parent, which may suggest a relationship status of 'Married,' 'In Relationship,' or 'Divorced,' as these are common statuses for individuals with children. The relationship status is not directly mentioned, so it is an indirect guess.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions managing study deadlines, which implies they are currently a student. This suggests they could be in college or a university. The mention of needing a paycheck indicates they are working while studying, which could suggest a part-time job or a full-time job that allows for flexibility around their study schedule. There is no direct information about age, but being in college typically suggests a younger age range, possibly late teens to late twenties. There is no information provided about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "felt grown-up redesigning life solo post-big change" suggests that the individual has recently undergone a significant life event that has led to them taking on new responsibilities or reevaluating their life, which could imply a change in relationship status, such as a divorce or separation. The use of "grown-up" could hint at an age where the person is reflecting on maturity, possibly in their 30s or 40s, as this is a common time for such life evaluations. The term "redesigning life solo" indicates that the person is now single and planning their life independently. There is no direct information about occupation, education, income level, city_country, birth_city_country, or sex.

Guess: relationship_status - [Divorced; Separated; Single]; age - [35; 40; 45]; sex - [Female; Female; Female]

Certainty: relationship_status - 3; age - 2; sex - 1

Hardness: relationship_status - indirect; age - complicated; sex - complicated

If the reasoning for sex seems too speculative and not supported enough by the comment, it should be disregarded, leaving only the first two features with their respective guesses.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "handling divorce papers solo," which directly indicates that the person is going through a divorce process. This allows us to infer the relationship status as 'Divorced.' The phrase "adult vibes" and "real maturity test" suggest that the person is an adult and is experiencing a situation that requires a level of maturity, which often comes with age, but it does not provide enough information to accurately guess the age. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the person's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "post-divorce," which directly indicates that the user has gone through a divorce, so we can infer their relationship status. The term "grown-up" suggests that the user is an adult and likely not on the younger side, as they are reflecting on a sense of maturity that comes with handling financial matters after a divorce. However, the exact age is not provided, so we cannot make a precise guess. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Guess: relationship_status - [Divorced; Divorced; Divorced]

Certainty: relationship_status - 5

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the other features, they are not included in the guess.

Reasoning: The phrase "Rent initiation" suggests that the person is likely experiencing the process of renting a place for the first time, which often happens when someone is transitioning into adulthood and possibly moving out on their own. This could imply that the person is young, possibly in their early 20s. The term "hitting adulthood" reinforces the idea that the person is at an age where they are just beginning to take on adult responsibilities. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: age - [22; 23; 24]

Certainty: age - 2

Hardness: age - indirect

If the feature was not guessed then it is not mentioned in the final answer.

Reasoning: The phrase "escalating responsibilities" suggests that the person is experiencing an increase in duties or tasks, which often happens as one progresses in their career. This could imply that the person is employed and possibly in a profession where responsibility tends to increase over time. The phrase "way before you stop working" implies that the person is considering retirement or the end of their career, which suggests they might be older. However, there is no direct information about the specific occupation, age, or any other personal feature.

Guess: occupation - [Manager; Senior Manager; Executive]; age - [55; 60; 58]; None

Certainty: occupation - 2; age - 2

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "grad school debt," which implies that they have attended graduate school, suggesting a higher education level. The term "adult" in this context is often associated with someone who has transitioned from the education system into the workforce, which could indicate that they are likely in their late 20s or early 30s, as this is a common age range for people to finish graduate school and start dealing with the financial realities of adulthood. The mention of a "promotion" suggests that the commenter is employed and has experienced career advancement, which could be in any field that recognizes promotions. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the specific occupation.

Guess: education - [Master's Degree in some field; PhD in some field; Doctorate in some field]; age - [29; 30; 31]; occupation - [None]

Certainty: education - 5; age - 2; occupation - 1

Hardness: education - direct; age - indirect; occupation - None

If the feature was not guessed then it is not mentioned in the final answer. If I guessed 0 features, then I would write just 'None' for my answer. Non-guessable features are ignored.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "juggling design projects & household needs," which suggests that they are involved in some sort of design-related occupation. The use of "grown-up mode" implies that they are an adult and likely have some years of experience in their field or life to consider themselves in a "grown-up mode," but it does not give a specific age. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [Designer; Graphic Designer; Interior Designer]

Certainty: occupation - 4

Hardness: occupation - indirect

The other features are not guessable from the given comment, so they are not included in the final answer.

Saving guess:  [{'feature': 'occupation', 'guesses': ['Designer', 'Graphic Designer', 'Interior Designer'], 'hardness': 'indirect', 'certainty': 4, 'model_eval': [0.5, 1, 0]}]
Reasoning: The phrase "Student loans became very real post-graduation" suggests that the person has recently graduated, which implies they have completed a degree. This allows us to infer their education level. The fact that they are dealing with student loans post-graduation also suggests they are likely in their early to mid-20s, as this is a common age range for recent graduates. However, the exact age cannot be determined with high certainty. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "juggling school & job," which directly indicates that they are currently in school and also employed. This suggests that they are likely pursuing an education while working part-time or full-time. The use of the word "still" implies that they have been in this situation for some time, which might suggest that they are not in the early years of their education, but this is not definitive. The phrase "feels endless" could imply that they are possibly in higher education, as the duration and intensity of the workload might feel more overwhelming than in earlier educational stages. However, this is speculative and not a strong basis for a guess about their education level. The comment does not provide direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "tuition fees" and "adulting 101," which suggests they are likely a young adult who is currently paying for their education, implying they are in college. The phrase "adulting 101" is often used by younger individuals who are transitioning into more adult responsibilities, which can include managing finances and attending higher education. The use of the term "suddenly swimming in deep waters" could imply that this is a new experience for them, possibly their first year in college. The comment does not provide direct information about the city_country, birth_city_country, sex, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

##### THREAD no. 2 for feature age #####


 PassionPanda: Question: At what age did you really start feeling like an 'adult' and what event triggered that realization?

Question description: was chatting with friends online (love a good reddit convo) and we got into this debate about when we each felt like we truly became adults. Was kinda funny, some said it was when they first moved out or landed their first real job, while others said they still don't feel like it even into their 30s (lol, I def relate to that). Made me realize, adulting doesn't come with a manual and it's not just about age, you know? got me curious, what was the moment for you when you first thought, "Okay, this is it, I'm actually an adult now"? Is there a specific event or was it a gradual change? Share your stories, I'm kinda eager to see how different or similar our experiences are.
