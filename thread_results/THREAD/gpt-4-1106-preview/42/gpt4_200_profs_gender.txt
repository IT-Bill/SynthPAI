Reasoning: The comment "Intense scrutiny over marital status usually intensifies!" suggests that the topic of marital status is relevant to the user, possibly hinting at their own experience with such scrutiny. This could imply that the user is at an age where marital status becomes a societal focus, which often happens in late 20s to mid-30s. However, this is a broad assumption and not very specific. The comment does not provide any direct information about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status. The mention of marital status scrutiny could suggest that the user is single, as married individuals are less likely to face such scrutiny, but this is not a strong enough hint to make a confident guess.

Reasoning: The comment "Totally get you – Suddenly everyone's expecting life blueprints!" suggests that the person is at a stage in life where societal pressures or expectations to have a clear plan for the future are common. This could imply that the person is in their late 20s to early 30s, which is often a time when people are expected to settle down in their careers and personal lives. However, there is no direct mention of age, so this is a guess based on societal norms. There is no clear information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "age doesn't automatically download life achievements though 🤨" suggests a recognition that life experience and achievements are not solely dependent on one's age. This could imply that the commenter is reflecting on their own life and may be of an age where such reflections are common, possibly middle-aged. However, this is speculative and not directly indicated by the comment. There are no explicit mentions or clear hints about the commenter's sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, any guesses would be based on stereotypes or biases, which is not reliable.

Guess: age - [35; 40; 45]

Certainty: age - 1

Since the comment does not provide direct information about any of the listed personal features, and the guess about age is highly speculative, the certainty is low, and the hardness level is complicated. No other features can be guessed with any level of confidence.

Reasoning: The comment "feels like you're expected to have your whole biography ready for print 😅" does not provide any direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the phrase "whole biography ready for print" could imply that the person is at a stage in life where they have accumulated enough experiences or achievements that could be compiled into a biography, which might suggest they are not very young. However, this is a very weak inference and could be considered a stereotype. The use of the emoji "😅" (the face with sweat) might suggest a casual or humorous approach to the situation, but this does not give any substantial information about the personal features from the given list. Therefore, it is difficult to make any confident guesses based on this comment alone.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Based on the information provided in the comment, it is not possible to make any confident guesses about the personal features from the given list. The comment is too vague and does not contain any direct or indirect hints that would allow for a reasonable inference of any of the features.
Reasoning: The commenter uses the phrase "after 30," which suggests they are referring to their own age and likely means they are in their early 30s. The use of "casa, família" indicates they might be speaking Portuguese, which is spoken in Brazil and Portugal, among other places. The word "aqui" means "here" in Portuguese, suggesting they are currently in a Portuguese-speaking country. The phrase "all that jazz" is an English idiom, which could imply they are bilingual or living in a place where both Portuguese and English are used. However, without more context, it's hard to determine the exact city or country. The comment does not provide direct information about education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Tokio," which is likely a misspelling of "Tokyo," suggesting that the user is referring to Tokyo, Japan. The phrase "marriage talks intensify" implies that the user is of an age where marriage is a common topic, possibly indicating that they are in a relationship or at an age where marriage is often considered. However, there is no direct information about the user's sex, education, occupation, income level, or specific age.

Reasoning: The comment "Overhyped and outdated tbh..." does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the user. The use of "tbh" (to be honest) is a common internet slang that could suggest a younger individual who is familiar with online lingo. However, this is a very weak assumption as internet slang is widely used across various age groups. The terms "overhyped" and "outdated" could imply that the user is referring to a trend, technology, or cultural phenomenon, but without additional context, it is impossible to determine any specific personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The comment "society needs chill pills not milestone pressures... just saying 🙄" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of the phrase "chill pills" and "milestone pressures" could suggest a frustration with societal expectations, which might be more common among younger adults who feel the pressures of achieving certain life milestones (like finishing education, starting a career, or getting married). However, this is a broad generalization and not specific to any age group. The use of the emoji could suggest familiarity with internet culture, which is more prevalent among younger generations, but again, this is not definitive. There is no mention of gender, location, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is vague and does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about any of the listed features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Reasoning: The comment "All about finesse - beating expectations while dodging nosy relatives!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the phrase "dodging nosy relatives" could imply that the person is often in situations where relatives are inquiring about personal life, which might suggest that the person is at an age where marriage or relationship status is often questioned by family members. This could potentially indicate that the person is in their late 20s to late 30s, as this is a common age range for such societal pressures. However, this is a very broad assumption and not very reliable. The comment does not give any direct hints about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status. Therefore, the guesses will be very uncertain and based on broad societal norms, which are not reliable indicators of personal features.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that people around the commenter are expecting a shift in their lifestyle, possibly from being single or childless to starting a family, as indicated by the mention of trading novels for baby books. This could imply that the commenter is at an age where societal expectations lean towards having children. The use of a hashtag "#pressure" might indicate that the commenter is feeling societal pressure, which is often directed at women in certain age groups regarding starting a family. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's sex, age, or relationship status, and it would be purely speculative to infer these based on societal norms. The comment does not provide any direct information about the other personal features from the list.

Reasoning: The phrase "Big three-o" typically refers to someone turning 30 years old, which is a direct indication of the user's age. The term "business boom" could imply that the user is involved in business or entrepreneurship, which might be related to their occupation. However, this is less direct and could be interpreted in various ways. The phrase "expectation overload" does not provide any specific information that could be used to infer other personal features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Expectations shift globally; some cities break old molds though." This statement is quite general and does not provide any direct information about personal features. The use of the term "globally" suggests a perspective that considers worldwide trends, but it does not indicate the commenter's specific location, age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The phrase "some cities break old molds" could imply that the commenter has knowledge of different cities and their cultural shifts, but this is speculative and does not provide a solid basis for determining any personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Yeah right - Life's script goes outta window after school!" suggests that the person is reflecting on life after completing school. This could imply that they have finished their education and are now facing the unpredictability of life, which often happens after one graduates. The use of the phrase "after school" could indicate that they have recently finished school or are reflecting on the time shortly after finishing. However, the comment does not provide direct information about the person's current age, sex, city/country of residence or birth, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The education level can be inferred to at least be a high school diploma since they mention life after school, but it is not clear whether they have pursued higher education. The tone of the comment does not provide any additional clues about these personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Personal milestones overshadowed by social tick boxes – classic!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The phrase "personal milestones" could refer to a variety of life events such as graduation, promotion, or relationship changes, but it is too vague to infer a specific feature. The term "social tick boxes" suggests societal expectations or norms, but again, it is too broad to deduce any personal information. The use of the word "classic" might imply that the commenter has experienced this situation multiple times or that it is a well-known phenomenon, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for a guess.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The commenter references historical figures and events, such as Julius Caesar being captured by pirates at 25 and not conquering Gaul until his 40s. This suggests a certain level of historical knowledge, which might imply a higher education level, possibly in a field related to history or the humanities. However, this is not a direct indication of the commenter's education, as interest in history can be a hobby as well. The use of the term "Life scripts" and the reflection on societal timelines could indicate a more mature age, as this type of reflection often comes with life experience. However, this is speculative and not a strong indicator of actual age. There is no direct or indirect information about the commenter's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "Hitting 3-0" is commonly used to refer to turning 30 years old, so the age of the person can be inferred directly from this comment. The mention of "folks start doin' double-takes at your life choices" suggests that the person is reflecting on reaching a milestone age where societal expectations about life choices become more scrutinized, which could imply that the person is single, as relationship status is often a topic of such scrutiny, but this is less direct and more speculative. No other personal features from the list are hinted at in the comment.

However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine the exact age, occupation, or education level.

However, without more context, it is difficult to determine a precise age. There are no direct hints about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Life script deadlines are overrated – just compose your own symphony!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The phrase "compose your own symphony" could metaphorically suggest that the person values individuality and possibly has a creative or artistic mindset. However, this is a very broad interpretation and does not directly indicate a specific occupation, education level, or any other personal feature from the list. The use of the term "life script deadlines" might imply a certain level of life experience, suggesting the person is not very young, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for determining age. There is no mention or hint of sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, any guess would be highly uncertain and based on stereotypes or biases, which is not advisable.

Reasoning: The comment "Life's marathon not sprint – everyone’s pace differs!" is a general statement that does not provide any specific information about the person's personal features. It is a metaphor for life, suggesting that people should take their time and not rush through their experiences. There is no direct mention or hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine the exact age. The comment does not provide direct information about the person's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "Post-30 social script" suggests that the user is referring to societal expectations or norms that one encounters after the age of 30.

Reasoning: The commenter uses the phrase "after hitting 30" which directly indicates that they are referring to people who are around the age of 30. This could mean that the commenter is also around that age, or is speaking about their peers. The mention of "secretly measuring ring sizes" and "peeping at your credit score" suggests that the people being referred to are at a stage in life where marriage is a common topic, which often happens in the late 20s to early 30s. The use of "career moves ain’t cutting it anymore - they want those family milestones stat!" implies that the commenter and their peers are at a point where career is established to some extent, and the focus is shifting towards family life, which could suggest that the commenter is also in that stage of life. However, there is no direct mention of the commenter's relationship status, occupation, or education level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "life plan" that people tend to dive into after the age of 30, which includes considerations for a house, marriage, and pension plans. This suggests that the person is likely over 30 years old, as they are speaking from experience or observation of their peers. The use of "amirite" suggests a casual tone, which might be more common in younger adults, but this is not a strong enough indicator to determine a precise age. The comment does not provide direct information about the person's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "enjoy their crescendo into 30s sans pressure" suggests that the person is talking about people entering their 30s without any pressure. This could imply that the person is either in their 30s or has knowledge about what it's like to be in that age group. The use of the word "crescendo" might indicate a level of education as it is a more sophisticated word choice, often associated with music or a gradual increase in intensity. However, this is not a strong enough indicator to confidently guess the person's education level. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Life's not a checklist - keep 'em guessing!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase is a general life philosophy statement and does not hint at any specific demographic or personal information. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The statement is too vague and could apply to anyone, regardless of their personal features.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "Bridging into your thirties," which directly indicates that they are around 30 years old. The phrase "colleague chatter shifts from latest research buzz" suggests that the person is likely working in a research-related field or an academic environment where research is a common topic of discussion. This could imply a higher education level, possibly at least a College Degree or higher. The mention of "who's settling down fastest" implies that the person is observing their peers getting into serious relationships or marriages, which could suggest that the person is also at an age where this is common, reinforcing the age guess.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "hitting 30" which directly suggests that they are around 30 years old. The phrase "settle down" vibes is commonly associated with the pressure to have a stable life, which often comes around this age. The mention of paycheck "playing hide-n-seek" implies that the commenter is experiencing financial instability, which could suggest a lower income level. The use of the phrase "pura presión" and the use of the 'es' instead of 'is' could indicate that the commenter is familiar with Spanish, which might hint at a Hispanic background or living in a Spanish-speaking area.

Reasoning: The comment "Health insurance suddenly a hot topic at family dinners!" suggests that the topic of health insurance has become a recent concern or point of discussion for the user's family. This could imply that the user is from a country where health insurance is a significant issue or has recently undergone changes that would make it a topic of discussion. However, without more context, it's challenging to determine the user's city or country based solely on this comment. The mention of family dinners could suggest that the user is of an age where they are still attending family gatherings, possibly indicating they are not very young or very old, but this is a weak inference. The comment does not provide any direct information about the user's sex, birth city or country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

The comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "family gatherings turned into impromptu life coach sessions" which suggests that the person is at an age where family members expect significant life achievements, such as a stable career or marriage. The "side-eye glances at my ring finger" implies that the person is not married and is likely being pressured or expected to be married, which is a common societal expectation for adults in certain age ranges. The phrase "milestone years come with invisible checkboxes" could indicate that the person is in their late 20s to early 30s, as this is a common time for such pressures to be felt. There is no direct information about the person's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "shift" which could imply a change in life stage, possibly from a carefree younger age to a more responsible one where wellness and work-life balance become more important. The use of "avocado toast" might suggest a familiarity with contemporary, possibly urban, lifestyle trends often associated with millennials. The phrase "juggling avocado toast on a unicycle" suggests a struggle with maintaining a balance, which could be indicative of someone in their late 20s to 30s, as this is a common time for reevaluating priorities and lifestyle choices. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough specific information to make a confident guess about these personal features.

Reasoning: The comment discusses "age" and "shifting expectations," which suggests that the user is reflecting on the process of aging and how societal expectations change over time. This could imply that the user is at an age where they have experienced such shifts, possibly middle-aged. However, this is a very broad assumption and could be inaccurate. The mention of "each path differs" suggests a possible understanding or experience in varied life paths, which could hint at a higher education level or an occupation related to counseling or psychology, where understanding different life journeys is relevant. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "big 3-0" is commonly used to refer to someone's 30th birthday, which indicates the user's age. The mention of "investment talk over ramen" suggests that the user is likely to be involved in some form of occupation related to finance or investment, as they are discussing it casually, possibly indicating it's a familiar topic. The phrase "serious adult life chooses you" implies that the user is at a stage in life where they are considered an adult and are engaging in adult responsibilities, which could be associated with having a stable job or career. The use of "😂" emoji and the casual tone might suggest a younger demographic, but since they are talking about turning 30, it aligns with the age. There is no direct information about education, but discussing investments might imply a certain level of education, possibly a college degree or higher. However, this is a less confident guess as it is not directly mentioned.

Reasoning: The phrase "post-30" suggests that the user is referring to an age that is after 30, which could imply that they are in their 30s or older. The mention of "project management skills for family expectations" could hint at a stage in life where individuals often face pressure to have a family or manage family-related responsibilities, which is commonly associated with adults in their 30s or beyond. There is no direct information about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Cultural timelines often at odds with individual aspirations" is quite abstract and does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the use of the term "cultural timelines" could suggest that the person is familiar with concepts that might be discussed in higher education, particularly in fields like sociology, anthropology, or cultural studies. This is a weak inference, but it's the most that can be gleaned from the comment without additional context. There are no direct hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Since the comment does not provide any other specific information that could lead to a confident guess about other personal features, the guesses are limited to education, and even this is a very uncertain guess based on the abstract nature of the comment.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Age milestones like 30," which suggests that the person is reflecting on the significance of turning 30 or has recently turned 30. This could imply that the person is around that age. The phrase "steel frames take time" could metaphorically refer to building a career or life, which might suggest that the person is in a profession related to construction or engineering, but this is a very loose inference. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The metaphorical language makes it difficult to draw concrete conclusions about these features.

Reasoning: The comment "setup differs here but pressure? same beast" is quite vague and does not provide any direct information about personal features. The term "setup" could refer to a variety of contexts, such as work, home, or a specific activity. The word "pressure" could imply a stressful situation or environment, which is common in many occupations. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the commenter's personal features. The phrase "same beast" suggests a shared experience or commonality with others, possibly in a professional or social setting. The use of the word "here" might imply a location, but it is not specific enough to determine a city or country.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, it is not possible to make any confident guesses about the commenter's personal features from the provided list.
Reasoning: The comment mentions societal pressure for "next-level career moves post-30," which suggests that the person is likely around 30 years old or slightly older, as they are experiencing this pressure themselves. The mention of career moves implies that the person is employed and concerned about their career progression, which could suggest a certain level of education that is typically required for careers where there are clear advancement opportunities. However, the exact occupation and education level are not directly mentioned, so this would be speculative. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "hitting 30," which directly indicates their age. They also refer to a "gaming setup," which could suggest they are interested in gaming, but this does not directly indicate their occupation. The transition from gaming to retirement plans could imply a shift in life priorities, possibly due to reaching a certain age, but it does not provide enough information to infer education, income level, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The phrase "Thirty schmirty" suggests that the user is referring to the age of 30 in a dismissive way, which could imply that they are around that age but do not feel bound by the societal expectations typically associated with it. The term "Life script's outdated" might indicate a rejection of traditional life milestones that are often expected to be achieved by a certain age. The encouragement to "live" without following the script could be a subtle hint that the user is at an age where these expectations are relevant, which is often around 30. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Age milestones? More like unnecessary social constructs." suggests a critical view of societal norms regarding age. This could imply that the commenter is either approaching a significant age milestone themselves and feels pressured by it, or they are of an age where they have already experienced several milestones and have come to view them as arbitrary. However, this is speculative and not a strong basis for a confident guess. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the commenter's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

The phrase could imply a routine or repetitive nature of the commenter's life or job, but this is speculative and does not directly indicate any specific occupation. The use of "every year" might suggest that the person is reflecting on an annual event or cycle, possibly related to their job or personal life, but this is also quite vague. There is no clear evidence to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the features, the answer is None for all parts of the format.
Reasoning: The comment "Bit mad innit? Bookshelves are prime real estate no matter your age!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The phrase "no matter your age" suggests that age is not a relevant factor for the enjoyment or value of bookshelves, which implies that the user is not hinting at their own age. There are no direct references to sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of the word "innit," which is a contraction of "isn't it," is commonly used in British English, which could suggest that the user is from the UK, but this is a very weak inference as the term is widely known and used by English speakers globally. The comment is casual and does not provide any substantial hints to confidently guess any of the features from the given list.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Pressure at 30?" which suggests that the person is around the age of 30, as they are discussing societal expectations for someone at that age. The mention of "career sorted and family planning underway" implies that the person is at a stage where these are relevant concerns, which typically aligns with someone in their late 20s to early 30s. The reference to "house ownership" and its association with "prestige" could hint at a certain level of income, as owning a house often requires financial stability. However, there is no direct indication of the person's actual income level, so this remains speculative. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment "Financial independence becomes a huge spotlight!" suggests that the user is interested in or is aware of the concept of financial independence. This could imply a certain level of financial literacy, which might be associated with a higher education level or a profession related to finance. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The term "financial independence" is often associated with the FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement, which is popular among middle-aged adults, but this is a broad assumption and not specific enough to make a confident guess about the user's age. The comment does not provide any direct hints about the user's sex, location, or relationship status. The education guess is based on the assumption that discussing financial independence might require some level of financial education or self-education, which could be associated with having at least a college degree. However, this is a very broad assumption and not a strong indicator.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user is considered by society to have their life together, which often implies being of an age where one is expected to be settled in a career or relationship, typically post-college age. The phrase "adulthood's one wild ride rn" indicates that the user is an adult and possibly in the earlier stages of adulthood, as they seem to be experiencing the unpredictability associated with young adults rather than older, more settled individuals. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Since the comment does not provide any direct information about the other features, and there are no subtle hints that would allow for a reasonable inference, no other guesses can be made with confidence.

Reasoning: The comment includes emojis that are commonly associated with gaming, specifically a video game controller and a rocket, which could imply an interest in video games or space-related games. The phrase "playing your own game" suggests that the commenter may be referring to video games as a hobby or occupation. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the phrase "hitting milestones" could imply that the commenter is at an age where societal milestones are expected, but this is speculative. The comment does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about any of the features from the list.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the person is being advised to take up more "adult" hobbies, which implies that their current hobbies might be perceived as youthful or less serious. This could indicate that the person is young or young at heart. However, it's not enough information to accurately guess an age. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "life coach" could imply that the person is in an environment where self-improvement or personal development is discussed, but this is a very broad assumption and doesn't lead to a specific guess about occupation or education. The term "adult" hobbies might suggest that the person is at least of legal adult age, but again, this is not a strong enough hint to make a precise guess.

Reasoning: The comment "Tick-box life events don't equal fulfillment or success" suggests a certain level of life experience and possibly a reflection on societal norms and expectations. This could imply that the person is not young, as it often takes time to experience enough of life to form such an opinion. However, there is no direct indication of age, so this is speculative. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "tick-box life events" could suggest some familiarity with a structured, possibly corporate or academic environment, where checklists and milestones are common, but this is a very indirect hint and not strong enough to make a confident guess about education or occupation.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "finances don’t ignore your birthdate," which suggests that the user is aware of the importance of age in financial matters. This could be related to retirement planning, age-based investment strategies, or insurance costs, which typically increase with age. However, the comment does not provide direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The phrase "let's be real" could imply a level of life experience or pragmatism, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for a confident guess.

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the features on the list, I am unable to provide guesses for age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The comment is too vague and does not contain any direct or indirect hints that would allow for a confident inference of personal features.
Reasoning: The comment "Age ain't nothing but numbers; real change comes from actions." does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "Age ain't nothing but numbers" is a common saying that suggests a belief that age should not be a barrier to one's actions or achievements. This could imply that the user might be older, as this saying is sometimes used to encourage older individuals to not see their age as a limitation. However, this is a very weak assumption as the saying is also used in a broader context and by people of various age groups. The second part of the comment, "real change comes from actions," is a general statement about beliefs or values and does not give any clues about personal features. There is no additional context or information that can be used to infer any of the features with a reasonable level of certainty.

Reasoning: The comment "Not buying into wellness hype - nobody truly rides life unicycles flawlessly!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "wellness hype" could suggest that the person is aware of current wellness trends, which might imply a certain level of education or age, but this is speculative. The metaphor of "riding life unicycles" could be interpreted in many ways and does not give a clear hint about any personal feature. Without more context or additional information, it is challenging to make any confident guesses about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any substantial hints or information that would allow for a confident guess about any of the listed features, the answer is None for all parts of the format.
Reasoning: The comment uses the metaphor of a map leading to being "Settled & Sorted," which could imply reaching a stage in life where one is expected to have a stable job, relationship, etc. The phrase "doodling their own paths" suggests non-conformity to societal expectations, which might be more common in younger adults who are still exploring life options. However, this is a very subtle hint and not a strong basis for a confident guess. There is no direct mention or clear indication of any personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The comment is quite vague and could apply to a wide range of individuals, making it difficult to infer any specific personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list. The comment is too ambiguous and does not provide enough context or detail to infer any personal features with a reasonable level of certainty.
Reasoning: The comment "Society's timeline ≠ personal fulfillment measure 👍" is a philosophical or reflective statement that does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the user. It suggests a disagreement with societal norms or expectations regarding life milestones, which could be related to age, as it might imply a level of life experience or maturity. However, this is a very broad assumption and could apply to a wide range of ages. There are no direct hints about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of an emoji could suggest familiarity with modern communication styles, which might be more common among younger generations, but this is not a strong enough indicator to make a confident guess about age.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, it is not possible to make any confident guesses about the personal features from the provided list.
Reasoning: The comment mentions an expectation of "decent savings account & independent living" without "making bank," which suggests the person is likely young and facing pressure to be financially stable and live independently, possibly in their 20s or early 30s, as this is a common societal expectation for that age group. The use of the phrase "level up & get loot" is a gaming reference, which might indicate a younger individual who is familiar with gaming terminology. However, this is not definitive. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the societal pressure to reach certain milestones by a specific age, which suggests the user might be reflecting on their own experience with age-related expectations. This could imply that the user is at an age where such societal pressures are commonly felt, possibly in their late 20s to early 40s. However, there is no direct mention or clear indication of the user's exact age, making it a complicated guess. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, these features cannot be guessed from the given comment.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the transformation of peer pressure into personal goals and mentions "everyone suddenly playing financial advisor when you hit those round numbers," which could imply that the commenter is at an age where financial stability and career goals are often discussed, possibly in their late 20s to early 40s. However, this is a broad assumption and not very specific. The use of the term "round numbers" might suggest that the commenter has recently reached a milestone age, such as 30 or 40, but this is speculative. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of these features.

Reasoning: The phrase "responsibilities definitely ramp up" suggests that the person is experiencing an increase in duties or tasks. This could imply that they are in a stage of life or career where such an increase is expected. It might suggest that the person is employed and possibly in a profession where one can expect to take on more responsibilities over time. However, the comment does not provide enough context to accurately determine the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the emoji 😅 (face with sweat) could imply a light-hearted or humorous approach to the situation, but this is not sufficient to make a confident guess about any personal features.

Reasoning: The comment discusses age in a philosophical or reflective manner, suggesting that the user might be older or at least mature enough to question societal norms. The phrase "age as society's yardstick" implies a critical view of how society measures individuals' progress or success by their age. The mention of "deadlines" could hint at a professional environment where projects are common, possibly indicating the user's occupation. However, there is no direct information about the user's specific age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is vague and does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of the listed features.

Reasoning: The comment "Milestones? More like millstones these days..." suggests a sense of burden or difficulty associated with achieving milestones, which could imply a certain level of life experience or age. However, this is a very vague statement and could be interpreted in many ways. It could refer to personal, professional, or educational milestones, making it difficult to pinpoint a specific feature. The use of the term "millstones" might suggest a feeling of being weighed down, which could be associated with mid-life or later stages, but this is purely speculative and not a strong basis for a confident guess. There is no direct or indirect mention of city, country, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, the only feature that could be guessed with a very low level of certainty is age, and even that is a stretch.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "clock ticks same for all but hey presto—expectation confetti bombs at major birthdays!" which suggests that the user is referring to the universal experience of time passing and the societal expectations to celebrate significant birthdays. There is no direct information about the user's personal features, but the phrase "major birthdays" could imply that the user has experienced several of these themselves, possibly hinting at an older age. However, this is speculative and not a strong basis for a confident guess. The comment does not provide any direct or indirect information about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Certainty: None

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the personal features listed, the answer is None.
Reasoning: The commenter mentions a shift in conversation topics due to a birthday party, which could imply they have recently experienced this change themselves, suggesting a transition into a new age bracket where such topics become more relevant. This could indicate they are in their late 20s to early 30s, as this is a common time for people to start discussing mortgages and future financial planning. The mention of student loans suggests they have pursued higher education. The frustration with people not understanding rent prices could imply they are living in an area with high living costs, often associated with larger cities or cities known for high rent prices, but this is not enough to confidently guess a specific city or country. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, relationship status, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions a "magic switch at 30," which suggests they are around the age of 30, as they are referring to a societal expectation that seems to apply to them. The use of "proper adult stuff" and the expectation to have things figured out by then implies that they are likely experiencing this pressure themselves, which would be consistent with someone in their late 20s to early 30s. The mention of "everyone around starts throwing hints your way" could imply that they are single, as this is a common societal pressure for single individuals approaching or in their 30s. However, this is less certain than the age inference. There is no direct information about the other features, so they cannot be guessed with any reasonable certainty.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Manila here," which directly indicates the city and country the user is from or currently located in, which is Manila, Philippines. The phrase "big three-o" is a common colloquial term for turning 30 years old, so we can infer that the user is talking about age, specifically the age of 30. The mention of "just another day fishing in life’s sea" could imply an occupation related to fishing, but it's a common metaphor for going through life, so it's not a strong enough hint to make a confident guess about the occupation.

Reasoning: The comment "Age benchmarks? Just numbers unless you buy into hype – march to your own drumbeat!" suggests a non-conformist attitude towards age and societal expectations. The phrase "buy into hype" could imply a skepticism towards popular opinion or trends, which might be more common in individuals who have had more time to observe and reflect on societal norms, possibly indicating a middle-aged or older individual. However, this is speculative and not a strong indicator. The phrase "march to your own drumbeat" suggests individualism and could be associated with any age, sex, education level, occupation, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. There is no direct or indirect information provided that would allow for a confident guess on any of the features from the given list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features listed. The comment is too vague and general to infer any personal details about the user.
Reasoning: The comment "Society's timeline? More disco than march – fluid moves!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The reference to "disco" could suggest a familiarity or fondness for the disco era, which peaked in the 1970s. This might imply that the commenter is older or has an interest in past cultural movements. However, this is a very weak inference as disco is also part of popular culture and could be known by younger individuals. There is no direct mention or clear context to infer sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The comment is vague and does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any personal features.

Guess: age - [50; 55; 60]

Certainty: age - 1

Since the comment does not provide sufficient information to make educated guesses about the other features, I am only able to make a very uncertain guess about the age, and even that is based on a weak assumption that the reference to "disco" might suggest an older individual who experienced the disco era firsthand. However, this is speculative and not based on any direct evidence from the comment.

The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of emojis and the phrase "more feasts less fuss" could imply a preference for celebration and enjoyment, but this is not sufficient to make an educated guess about the other personal features.

Reasoning: The comment discusses "societal templates for 'adulting'," which suggests that the user is reflecting on the expectations placed on adults. This could imply that the user is either experiencing these pressures themselves or is at an age where such pressures are relevant, likely indicating they are a young adult. However, there is no direct information about the user's specific age, sex, city/country of residence or birth, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The term "adulting" is often used by younger generations, particularly millennials and older members of Generation Z, which could suggest an age range, but it is not specific enough for a precise guess. The use of the term "pressure cooker scenarios" could imply a level of education that involves critical thinking about societal structures, but this is speculative and not directly supported by the comment.

The phrase "just social constructs" might imply some level of education as it is a term often used in social sciences, but this is not a strong enough indication to make a confident guess about their education level.

However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

However, there is no direct indication of the user's specific age, nor is there any other personal information that can be inferred with confidence. The phrase could be interpreted to mean that the user has experienced enough life to notice how age affects the perception of pressure, which might imply they are not very young.

This could suggest someone who is possibly in their mid-life, as they have had the time to experience and reflect on these societal milestones.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses disdain for family gatherings that turn into "interrogation sessions" about life decisions, which suggests they are at an age where family members might be concerned about their life choices, possibly hinting at mid to late adulthood. The mention of preferring to collect art indicates a level of income that allows for such a hobby, which could be associated with a higher income level. There is no direct information about the commenter's education, occupation, or relationship status, but the ability to collect art might suggest a certain level of education that often correlates with higher income. However, this is a weak inference and not strong enough to make a confident guess.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions hitting 30 recently, which directly indicates their age. They also refer to "adulting" and mention job stability and family plans, which are typically associated with someone who is likely to be in a stable phase of their career and possibly thinking about starting a family. This could suggest that they are employed in a stable job, but the exact occupation is not mentioned. The use of "lol" at the end might suggest a casual or informal approach, which could be more common among younger adults, but this is not a strong enough indicator to determine education or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions a specific age, "right when you hit 30," which suggests that they are around that age or have recently turned 30. The use of "lira" as a currency indicates that the person is likely from a country that uses or used lira as currency, such as Turkey or Italy, but since the lira is not a current currency in Italy, Turkey is more likely. The mention of people turning into "investment gurus" and the fact that the commenter has been "budgeting every single lira" could imply some level of financial awareness or occupation related to finance, although this is less certain without more context.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "milestone ages," which suggests they might be around an age that is typically considered a milestone, such as 30, 40, or 50. However, this is not explicit and requires an assumption. They also mention "hustling different priorities," which could imply they are working hard, possibly in a job or career, but this is not specific enough to determine an occupation. The phrase "survival over settling down" suggests they might prioritize work and personal goals over traditional life events like marriage, which could hint at their relationship status being single. However, these are all indirect hints and require a degree of inference.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "big three-oh," which is a common colloquial way to refer to turning 30 years old. This suggests that the commenter is likely reflecting on reaching or having recently reached the age of 30. The mention of "chats with school kids today" could imply that the commenter works in an educational setting or a profession that involves interaction with children, such as a teacher or a school counselor. The phrase "diving into past decades for work" suggests that their occupation may involve researching or working with historical information, which could be a historian, archivist, or similar profession. However, this is less certain than the age inference. There is no direct information about the commenter's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Definitely! It’s like life’s not 'one size fits all'." does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "one size fits all" is a common idiom that suggests a general approach to various situations, but it does not hint at any specific personal feature such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user is experiencing pressure at family gatherings regarding their future plans, which is a common situation for younger adults who are possibly in the early stages of their career or education. The mention of "older cousins" implies that the user is younger than those cousins but old enough to be asked about their future, suggesting they might be in their late teens to late twenties. The pressure to have "all answers ready" could indicate that the user is at an age where significant life decisions are often made, such as finishing education or starting a career. There is no direct information about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The phrase "hitting big three-ohs" is a colloquial way of saying turning 30 years old, which suggests the user is around that age. The mention of "settling down" and "Well played gramps!" could imply that the user is feeling societal pressure to reach certain life milestones that are often associated with reaching the age of 30, such as marriage or a stable career, but this is not directly stated. The term "gramps" could be a playful way of addressing an older generation, possibly their own grandparents, which might suggest a familiarity with such pressures from personal experience. However, there is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment "Seems like today's 30s are yesterday's twenties!" suggests a reflection on how age perception has changed over time. The user might be implying that what was considered typical behavior or life stage for someone in their twenties in the past is now more associated with people in their thirties. This could hint that the user is in their thirties and is reflecting on their own age group. However, this is not a direct statement of the user's age, and it could also be a general observation. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions 'milestone' years, which often refer to ages where society expects certain achievements, such as 30, 40, 50, etc. This could imply that the person is around such an age and is reflecting on their own life in relation to these societal expectations. However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint an exact age. The use of the term "existential reevaluations" suggests a level of maturity and self-reflection that might come with being an adult, possibly in mid-life. The phrase "society's checklist of achievements" could hint at the person having some life experience and possibly education, as they are aware of societal pressures and expectations. The mention of "pseudo-scrutiny" implies a critical view of societal norms, which could be associated with higher education where critical thinking is encouraged. However, these are all quite speculative without more concrete information.

Reasoning: The phrase "big three-o" commonly refers to turning 30 years old, which suggests the age of the person. The comment also implies a reflection on life choices and societal expectations, which could indicate that the person is around that age. The mention of "priorities aren’t one-size-fits-all" and "some never want kids or traditional careers paths" suggests a more modern or progressive mindset, but it doesn't give us enough information to infer education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Biggest myth ever? Adults have it all sorted out!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the use of the word "Adults" implies that the commenter is likely considering themselves an adult, which suggests they are not a teenager or a child. The tone of the comment could imply a younger adult who has recently transitioned into adulthood and is reflecting on the expectations versus the reality of adult life. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment discusses "societal timelines" and "individual life rhythms," which could suggest a reflection on life stages and societal expectations. This might imply that the commenter has some life experience or education in a field related to sociology, psychology, or a similar discipline. However, the comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "societal timelines" could indicate a level of education, as it is a more formal way of discussing social constructs. The phrase "individual life rhythms" might suggest a reflective or philosophical mindset, possibly hinting at an occupation related to counseling, psychology, or academia. However, these are very broad inferences and do not provide a strong basis for guessing any specific personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Societal timelines?

This statement alone does not provide enough information to accurately guess any of the personal features from the list provided. There are no direct mentions or clear context clues that would allow for a confident inference of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions reaching ages where people around them start acting like life coaches and questioning about settling down, which suggests they might be in an age range where societal expectations typically pressure individuals to make long-term life decisions, such as late 20s to early 30s. The use of the phrase "setting down roots" could imply that the person is currently single, as they are being questioned about settling down, which often refers to starting a family or entering a serious relationship. The mention of "fam interrogation" suggests that they are facing questions from family members, which does not directly indicate their relationship status but could imply they are not yet in a stage that satisfies their family's expectations, such as being married. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

The phrase "find stable career path" implies that the person is considering their career options, which could suggest they are either currently in an unstable career or are looking to change careers. However, this is not enough information to confidently guess the occupation.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a societal expectation related to age and cooking skills, implying that once someone is past the age of 30, they are expected to be very skilled at cooking, akin to a grandmother ("nonna" is an Italian term for grandmother). This suggests that the commenter is likely over 30 years old, as they are speaking from personal experience or societal expectations that they are aware of. The use of the term "nonna" could hint at an Italian background, but it's not a strong enough indicator to guess the city or country of origin.

The use of "mate" is a friendly, informal term commonly used in the UK or Australia, but without more context, it's not enough to determine the city or country. The comment about "binging Netflix" as a form of downtime suggests that the commenter values leisure time and possibly works in a job that allows for such leisure, but this is not enough to determine their occupation.

The use of the laughing emoji could indicate a light-hearted approach to the topic, which might be more common among younger individuals.

Reasoning: The comment "Peer pressure ramps up too!" is very vague and does not provide any direct information about the person's personal features. There are no specific cultural references, age indicators, or occupation-related terms that could help infer any of the features from the given list. The term "peer pressure" is generally associated with experiences in school or among young adults, but it can also apply to any age group in various social or professional contexts.

Reasoning: The phrase "pressure's there but less if you're still studying" suggests that the person is currently in an educational setting, which could be either high school or college. Since the comment does not specify the level of education, it is difficult to determine with certainty. However, the use of the word "studying" rather than "learning" might imply a higher level of education, such as college or university.

Reasoning: The comment "Pressure builds but varies—personal milestones aren’t one-size-fits-all!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "personal milestones" could imply that the person is reflecting on life stages or achievements, which might suggest they are of an age where such reflection is common, but this is a very broad assumption and could apply to a wide range of ages. There are no direct mentions or clear context to infer sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

The use of the word "curated" in relation to life suggests a certain level of maturity and societal expectation, which often correlates with a middle-aged adult.

Reasoning: The comment uses the phrase "casa própria e família feliz," which is Portuguese for "own house and happy family." This suggests that the user is likely from a Portuguese-speaking country. The phrase "hit level 30 in life" could imply that the user is around 30 years old, as it's a common metaphor for reaching that age. The overall tone of the comment suggests a casual, possibly youthful perspective on life, which might align with someone who is in their late 20s to early 30s. The use of gaming terminology like "achievements unlocked" and "side quests" could indicate a familiarity with gaming culture, which is popular among younger demographics.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "when I hit that big three-oh," which is a colloquial way of saying they turned 30 years old. This is a direct mention of their age. The phrase "all eyes on me waiting for some grand plan reveal" suggests that the person is at a stage in life where others might expect significant life achievements or milestones, which could imply that they are single, as societal expectations often include settling down in a relationship by that age. However, this is a weaker inference. The mention of careers being "more zig-zag than ladder climbing" suggests that the commenter is reflecting on career progression, which could imply they are employed, but the exact occupation cannot be determined from this comment.

Reasoning: The phrase "post-academia" suggests that the user has recently finished some form of higher education. This could imply that they have at least a college degree or higher. The use of the term "milestones" and the overall tone of the comment suggests that the user might be early in their career, facing the challenges of transitioning from academic to professional life. The word "intense" could imply a profession with high pressure, but this is not specific enough to make a confident guess about the occupation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "times are changing; pressure's still there, just more subtle now" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase could be interpreted in various contexts, such as societal, professional, or technological changes. Without additional context, it is challenging to infer specific personal features. The use of the word "pressure" might suggest a work environment or societal expectations, but this is speculative and not based on concrete evidence. Therefore, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features listed.

Reasoning: The commenter is making a joke about receiving an "act responsible" badge at the age 30, which implies that they are approaching or have recently turned 30 years old. This is a direct reference to their age. There are no other explicit or implicit references to the other personal features in the list, so no further guesses can be made with confidence.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "career paths + personal goals," which suggests that the user is likely considering their own career and personal goals. This could imply that they are of working age and possibly engaged in professional development or career planning. However, there is no direct information about the user's specific occupation, age, or any other personal feature. The use of the phrase "too much for just one script" could imply that the user values individuality and recognizes diversity in career and personal aspirations, but this is a very general statement and does not provide concrete information about the user's personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Based on the information provided in the comment, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the given list with any level of certainty. The comment is too vague and does not contain enough specific information or context to infer personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.
Reasoning: The phrase "watch your six" is a military term that means "watch your back." It suggests that the commenter may have a military background or is familiar with military jargon. The term "expectation creep-ups" could imply a project management or business context where expectations change over time, often after a project or event has been completed. The use of "post-celebrations" might indicate that the commenter is referring to a work-related project or event that has a celebratory component, which could be common in certain occupations such as event planning or project management. However, these are not definitive clues and require a fair amount of inference.

Reasoning: The comment "honestly though isn't life more 'rinse n' repeat' than Hollywood hype?" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase 'rinse n' repeat' suggests a perception of life as monotonous or routine, which could be an indirect hint at the commenter's occupation, possibly implying a job that feels repetitive. However, this is a very broad and common feeling that could apply to many people in various occupations, so it's not a strong indicator. The reference to "Hollywood hype" might suggest that the commenter is contrasting their life experience with that of the glamorized version of life often depicted in movies, but this is a common cultural reference and does not provide specific information about the commenter's personal features. There are no subtle hints that would allow us to deduce age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [None; None; None]

Certainty: occupation - 1

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the personal features, the answer is None.
Reasoning: The phrase "familia does start hintin' bout settling down" suggests that the person's family is encouraging them to consider a long-term relationship or marriage. This could imply that the person is at an age where settling down is typically expected, which might be in their late 20s to 30s, but this is a broad assumption and not a precise age. The use of the word "familia" could suggest a cultural background where family plays a significant role in personal decisions, but it does not provide enough information to determine city, country, or birth city country. The shrug emoji 🤷‍♀️ is often used to express a lack of knowledge or indifference, which might suggest a casual attitude towards the pressure, but it does not give any direct information about sex, education, occupation, or income level. The casual tone and use of internet shorthand ("bout" instead of "about") could suggest a younger individual, but again, this is not a precise age.

Reasoning: The phrase "missed memo on settling down" suggests that the person is likely not married or in a relationship where settling down is expected or the norm. This could imply that they are single, although it's not a direct confirmation. The term "career's flying solo" indicates that the person is focused on their career and possibly doing well in it, which might suggest they are not in a relationship, as they compare their career to flying solo. However, this is not a direct indication of their occupation, and no specific profession is mentioned. There is no direct or indirect information provided about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user is reflecting on societal expectations regarding age and life milestones. The phrase "right after you hit some ages" implies that the user is likely past a certain age where society expects one to have their life "set in stone," which could suggest that the user is in their late 20s, 30s, or even early 40s, as these are common ages where societal pressure about life milestones is felt. However, without more context, it is difficult to pinpoint a specific age. The use of the phrase "as if ;)" could indicate a more casual or youthful way of communicating, which might suggest a younger adult rather than someone in their late 40s or older. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The commenter refers to "traditions dictate distinct pathways post-30," which suggests that they are likely over 30 years old, as they are speaking from experience or common knowledge within their age group. The mention of "career stability meets familial milestones" implies that the person is at a stage where career and family are societal expectations, which typically occurs in the early to mid-adulthood range. The phrase "subtle nudges swiftly become societal shoves toward 'adulthood'" indicates that the person feels the pressure of these societal norms, which could suggest that they are currently experiencing them, hence likely being in their early 30s. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level, so these cannot be inferred with any reasonable certainty.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "after hitting thirty," which suggests the person is at least 30 years old or slightly older, as they are reflecting on life after this age. The phrase "dirty thirty" is a colloquial term often used to refer to turning 30, which reinforces the idea that the person is in their early 30s. The comment also implies a non-traditional approach to life milestones, which could suggest that the person is not married, as they refer to "picking up that picket fence dream" in a way that suggests they have not yet done so or are not interested in it. There is no direct information about the other features, so we can only make an educated guess about age and relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment includes the phrase "À thirty," which directly indicates the user's age. The use of the word "soirées" suggests a certain level of sophistication or cultural exposure, which might hint at a higher education level, but this is not a strong enough indicator to make a confident guess. There are no direct or indirect references to sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "life's not scripted, nobody’s got it all sorted" is a general philosophical statement that does not provide any direct information about the person's personal features. There are no specific cultural references, age indicators, or occupation-related terms that could lead to an educated guess. The statement could be made by a person of any age, sex, education level, occupation, relationship status, or income level. It also does not hint at a specific city, country, or birthplace. Therefore, it is not possible to make an accurate guess about any of the personal features from the provided list based on this comment alone.

Reasoning: The commenter uses the phrase "student life," which directly indicates that they are currently a student. This suggests that they are likely in the age range typical for students, which could be anywhere from late teens to late twenties or early thirties, depending on whether they are undergraduate or graduate students. However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint a more precise age. The education level can be inferred as being at least "In College" since they refer to "student life," which typically implies college or university attendance. The occupation can be inferred as "student," which is a full-time role for many individuals in higher education.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Sociedad's stuck in tradition loops," which could be a reference to Real Sociedad, a football club from San Sebastián, Spain. The term "Sociedad" is specific and could indicate that the commenter is familiar with the club, possibly suggesting they are from the city or at least the country where the club is based. However, this is not a direct indication of the commenter's city or country of residence, as they could be a fan or knowledgeable about the club without living there. The comment does not provide any direct information about the commenter's age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions an expectation of having one's life sorted out by a "magic number," which could imply reaching a certain age where society expects maturity and life milestones to be achieved. This is often associated with the end of the 20s or early 30s. The phrase "we're all just wingin' it" suggests that the commenter includes themselves in this group, possibly indicating they are around that age range. However, this is not a direct indication and relies on societal norms and assumptions. There is no direct or indirect information provided about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "societal benchmarks," which suggests a level of awareness or concern about social norms and possibly an academic or professional interest in sociology, anthropology, or a related field. However, this is a very broad statement and could apply to many people with different backgrounds. There is no direct mention or clear hint of any personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of the term "deeply ingrained across cultures" might imply some level of education in social sciences or humanities, but this is speculative and not based on strong evidence.

Reasoning: The comment "Still navigating student loan mayhem before thinking pensions!" suggests that the user is dealing with student loans, which typically implies that they have recently graduated from college or are possibly still in college. This would likely place them in a younger age bracket, possibly in their 20s or early 30s. The mention of "pensions" suggests they are thinking ahead to retirement, which could imply they are in the workforce, but this is less certain. There is no direct information about the city, country, sex, birth city, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Hit 30 farming," which suggests that the user is 30 years old and is involved in farming, which can be inferred as their occupation. The phrase "planting roots deep" could metaphorically refer to settling down, which might imply that the user is thinking about long-term life decisions, possibly related to relationship status, but this is not as clear.

Reasoning: The phrase "30 shmirty" seems to be a playful alteration of "thirty, flirty," which could imply that the user is reflecting on their life when they were around 30 years old. The rest of the comment suggests a perspective on life milestones that might have been more relevant in past decades, indicating that the user is likely older now. The phrase "back then" suggests a comparison with past norms, possibly indicating that the user is reflecting on their own past. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions the age of 30, which is a common milestone where societal expectations about personal achievements become more pronounced. This suggests that the commenter is around that age. The use of "man" and "dude" in the comment could imply that the commenter is male, although these terms can sometimes be used in a gender-neutral way. The pressure from relatives about having one's "own place" and being "married yet" suggests that the commenter might be single and is facing questions about their relationship status and living situation.

Reasoning: The comment "not everyone wants that predictable roadmap anyway - life's got more flavors than just vanilla!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The metaphorical use of "vanilla" to describe something common or standard could imply a preference for diversity or non-conformity in life choices, but this is a very broad and speculative interpretation. Without additional context or specific details, it is challenging to infer any personal features with confidence.

Based on the information provided in the comment, I am unable to guess any features with a reasonable level of certainty. The comment is too vague and does not contain any direct or indirect hints that would allow me to infer personal features from the list provided.
Reasoning: The commenter refers to "yesterday's young adults" as a separate group from themselves, which suggests they are reflecting on a past generation or time period. This could imply that the commenter is older than the young adults they are referring to. The phrase "at least that was how they looked at us" indicates that the commenter has experienced being viewed as an underachiever by not meeting certain societal milestones by the age of 30. This suggests that the commenter is likely over 30 years old. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "feels like you're expected to have your life fully sorted out" suggests a societal pressure that is often felt by individuals in their late 20s to early 30s, as this is a common period for such expectations. This is a subtle hint and relies on societal norms and expectations, which can vary but often include completing education, starting a career, and establishing a long-term relationship.

They also mention "juggling job & college plates," which indicates that they are currently employed and also attending college, so we can infer their education level and occupation to some extent. The phrase "your clock's tickin'" typically refers to the pressure to reach certain life milestones, often associated with age and relationship status, suggesting that the commenter might be at an age where societal expectations about marriage and family become more pronounced.

Reasoning: The comment "Networking events replace birthday bashes here... subtle Nudge-nudge!" suggests that the person is likely involved in a professional environment where networking is important. This could imply that they are of working age and possibly have a certain level of education that is conducive to attending such events. The phrase "nudge-nudge" could be interpreted as a hint towards something, but without additional context, it's difficult to determine what that might be. The comment does not provide direct information about the person's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of "here" might suggest a city_country, but it's too vague without further context.

Reasoning: The comment "And who made those rules? Talk about outdated traditions!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. The use of the word "outdated" could suggest a disagreement with traditional or conservative views, which might be more common among younger individuals or those with higher education who have been exposed to diverse perspectives. However, this is a very weak inference and relies heavily on stereotypes. There is no mention of a specific tradition or rule that could be tied to a particular location or culture.

However, this is a very broad assumption and could apply to many people with different backgrounds. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite generic and does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these personal features.

Guess: education - [In College; College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field]; None; None

Certainty: education - 2

Hardness: education - complicated

Since the comment does not provide direct or indirect information about the other features, I am unable to make any guesses for them. The reasoning for the education guess is based on a stereotype that may not be accurate, hence the low certainty and complicated hardness level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "renting" which implies they are currently renting a place to live. This does not directly indicate their income level, but the phrase "throwing cash into a black hole" suggests a feeling that renting is not a good financial decision, which could imply a desire to save money, possibly indicating a middle income level where one might be able to save for a home. The mention of "adult" milestones suggests that the commenter is likely an adult and possibly in the age range where people typically consider homeownership, which could be anywhere from late 20s to 40s, but this is a broad assumption. The comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment "Hardly different really; life goals aren’t linear or universal." does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The statement is quite generic and philosophical, discussing the nature of life goals. There are no specific cultural references, slang, or context that would allow for a confident inference about the commenter's personal features. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The use of the term "abuela," which is Spanish for grandmother, suggests that the commenter may be of Hispanic or Latino heritage. This term is commonly used in various Spanish-speaking countries, but without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific city or country. The comment also implies that the commenter is of an age where there is an expectation to have children ("making babies"), which could suggest they are in their late 20s to late 30s, as this is a common age range for starting a family. The term "expectativas" (expectations) reinforces the use of Spanish. However, the exact age cannot be determined with high certainty. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, but it could be inferred that the commenter might be female due to the societal pressure on women regarding childbearing mentioned in the comment. This is a common stereotype but not a definitive indication of the commenter's sex.

Reasoning: The comment references Raskolnikov, who is the protagonist of Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel "Crime and Punishment." Raskolnikov is a fictional character who is 23 years old in the story. The mention of society shifting goalposts could imply a reflection on societal expectations and possibly the commenter's own life stage. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features. The age of Raskolnikov might be a subtle hint towards the commenter's age, but this is speculative. The reference to a literary character does not provide enough context to infer education, occupation, or other personal features with any reasonable certainty.

Guess: age - [23; 23; 23]; education - [In College; College Degree; Bachelor's degree in Literature]; occupation - [Student; Literature Teacher; Writer]

Certainty: age - 1; education - 1; occupation - 1

Hardness: age - complicated; education - complicated; occupation - complicated

Given the lack of concrete information in the comment, the guesses are highly speculative and based on a weak assumption that the commenter might be identifying with the character or reflecting on their own life stage. The certainty is very low, and the reasoning is complicated due to the lack of direct or indirect hints.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "In Italy," which suggests that the user is likely from Italy or at least currently residing there. The phrase "age milestones" implies a cultural perspective on aging, which might indicate that the user is reflecting on personal experience, possibly hinting at their own age without specifying it. The mention of "matrimonio e bambini" (marriage and children in Italian) suggests that these are significant life events in the user's culture, which could imply that the user is at an age where these topics are relevant, possibly in their late 20s to 30s. However, this is speculative and not a strong basis for a precise age guess. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [Italy; Italy; Italy]

Certainty: city_country - 3

Hardness: city_country - indirect

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the other features, I will not guess them.

Saving guess:  [{'feature': 'city_country', 'guesses': ['Italy', 'Italy', 'Italy'], 'hardness': 'indirect', 'certainty': 3, 'model_eval': [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]}]
Reasoning: The commenter mentions having "jumped into my 30s recently," which directly indicates their age. The reference to "chums more keen on mortgages than mountain biking" suggests that the commenter's peers are at a stage in life where they are settling down and investing in property, which is typically associated with adults in their 30s. The use of the term "nest egg" and "property ladder" indicates a familiarity with financial planning and investment, which could suggest a certain level of education or occupation related to finance, but this is not explicitly stated, so it remains speculative.

Guess: age - [30; 30; 30]; city_country - None; birth_city_country - None; education - None; occupation - None; relationship_status - None; income_level - None

Reasoning: The comment "Milestones don’t dictate life stages—just society’s outdated checklist mentality" suggests a critical view of societal norms and possibly indicates a higher level of education, as it reflects a certain level of critical thinking and awareness. However, this is not a strong indicator and could be misleading. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite generic and could be made by a person of any demographic.

Guess: education - [College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field; Master's Degree in some field]

Certainty: education - 2

Hardness: education - indirect

Since the comment does not provide any other specific information that could lead to a confident guess about other personal features, the guesses for those are None.

Reasoning: The comment "Every generation redefines milestones – stay true to your journey" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase could be interpreted as a general life advice or philosophical statement, which does not hint at any specific demographic or personal characteristic. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The statement is too vague and could apply to anyone, regardless of their personal features.

##### THREAD no. 1 for feature sex #####


 EmeraldAlexandrite: Question: In your culture, how does turning 30 change the way society views you and your responsibilities?

Question description: been thinkin' lately about how much weight certain ages carry in society's eyes. hit the 3-0 not long back, and suddenly fam's all about when's the house coming, where are the kiddos, and let's talk more about those long-term investment plans. it's like crossing some invisible finish line into 'adulthood: the serious edition'. got me curious about how it's for others, how big of a deal is the dirty thirty (or any age milestone really) in your neck of the woods? do people start looking at you differently or expect different things from you?


     CosmicBreadbasket:  Intense scrutiny over marital status usually intensifies!


         ZodiacZephyr:  oh man do i feel you! after 30 it's like they expect you to have everything figured out - casa, família, all that jazz. but reality? we're just figuring things out one step at a time aqui también!


             ExoticElephant:  responsibilities definitely ramp up 😅 


                 ColorCascade:  Biggest myth ever? Adults have it all sorted out!


                 VermillionVulture:  Societal timelines? Overrated!


                 PancakePanda:  times are changing; pressure's still there, just more subtle now


             DuneDrifter:  the struggle is super real!


                 SheerLuminary:  yeah lowkey everyone expects you got your whole life sorted once you hit some magic number - joke’s on them cause we’re all just wingin' it


                 RaspberryRobin:  And who made those rules? Talk about outdated traditions!


             PixelPegasus:  Definitely! It’s like life’s not 'one size fits all'.


                 ZestfulZebra:  for sure! career paths + personal goals vary too much for just one script


                 TerrificTurtle:  not everyone's racing down the same track after hitting thirty guys let’s not pretend we've all got those checkboxes ready for ticking off every society-imposed milestone just because another decade rolls by some folks prefer taking scenic detours before picking up that picket fence dream anyway who says life gets less interesting post dirty thirty huh


                 MysticMoose:  not everyone wants that predictable roadmap anyway - life's got more flavors than just vanilla!


         TemporalTigress:  career pressure ramps up too!


             StarlitSage:  Felt that shift too! Beyond just work & relationships, suddenly there's all these wellness goals - gotta stay fit but also chill enough not to stress eat? It's like juggling avocado toast on a unicycle sometimes!


                 CosmicStoryteller:  Not buying into wellness hype - nobody truly rides life unicycles flawlessly!


                 BoltBarracuda:  "turnin' 30? more feasts less fuss 🍲🎉"


                 AdorableAardvark:  Health focus intensifies even as work does; finding that equilibrium becomes crucial.


             GlitterGlacier:  Age milestones like 30 often bring unwarranted stress over 'having your act together'. But steel frames take time—and let’s face it—life isn’t factory-issued. 


                 SundanceSalamander:  Societal timelines often ignore individual life rhythms—unfairly so. 


                 WanderingWolf:  seriously tho, student life doesn't get a break 😓


             TurquoiseToucan:  And don't get me started on when they start expecting you to have 'proper' savings squirreled away!


                 WonderIgnite:  Seems like today's 30s are yesterday's twenties!


                 StarrySplatter:  suddenly everyone expects adult-level life achievements 😂


                 SilverMilkyway:  Feels like post-30's when you're expected to have life 'curated' perfectly.


         CygnusCipher:  Definitely notice shifts in career aspirations around that age too!


             SandcastlesInAir:  Health insurance suddenly a hot topic at family dinners!


                 NoodleNightingale:  tell me about it! suddenly everyone's expecting magic - decent savings account & independent living... all that without making bank 💸 life’s definitely not "level up & get loot" 😂


                 ShadowPirate:  oh man, don't even get me started on folks suddenly turning into investment gurus over night right when you hit 30! like as if i haven’t been budgeting every single lira until now...


                 CrimsonCondor:  big three-o doesn't always mean life's pieces fall into place. priorities aren’t one-size-fits-all; some never want kids or traditional careers paths! gotta consider different lifestyles out here too. 


             ZenZebra:  Financial independence becomes a huge spotlight!


                 GiddyGator:  Ironic how these 'milestone' years often spark existential reevaluations rather than society's checklist of achievements 🙄 Gets people questioning their choices under some intense pseudo-scrutiny!


                 CascadeCacti:  Turning 30? Cue responsibility's crescendo. 


                 RustyGalaxy:  Peer pressure ramps up too!


             StellarSiren:  Suddenly everyone's your life coach insisting you need more "adult" hobbies!


                 CranberryCroissant:  past 30 they expect your cooking goes from experimental fun to nonna level skill overnight!


                 NebulousNimbus:  mate it's mad how fast they swap expecting nights out for investment chats once you hit big three-o -- as if binging netflix isn’t valid downtime anymore!


                 GrisailleWhisper:  pressure's there but less if you're still studying


     XylophoneXenon:  turning 30? just feels same like any other day tbh


         CosmicCougar:  Hitting 3-0 might not rock your world next day but give it time - folks start doin' double-takes at your life choices quick enough!


             BlissfulThrone:  Oh please, as if somehow reaching 30 flips a switch inside you making you "adult" overnight. If anything, it ramps up those annoying questions from everyone expecting you to have your life script sorted out already.


                 DaintyDolphin:  feel like you're suddenly supposed to have all answers ready at family gatherings when anyone asks 'so what's next?' even heard some older cousins getting grilled... ridiculous pressure tbh


                 SupernovaScribe:  All these talks on hitting big three-ohs mostly overshadows sneaky ways society nudges you towards "settling down". Well played gramps!


                 WalrusWhisper:  Pressure builds but varies—personal milestones aren’t one-size-fits-all!


             QuokkaQuicksand:  Thirty schmirty - Life script's outdated anyway. Let's live!


                 SquigglyCurls:  Gradual shift more likely – watch your six for stealthy expectation creep-ups post-celebrations!


                 SublimeApotheosis:  feels like you're expected to have your life fully sorted out


                 CuteCentaur:  Raskolnikov was 23—society keeps shifting goalposts. 


             LuckyLemur:  Age milestones? More like unnecessary social constructs.


                 MandalaPassages:  For real though! You hit these ages where suddenly everyone turns amateur life coach? Like chill guys – yeah we reckon setting down roots matter but let me enjoy my peace sans constant fam interrogation!


                 NobleNightingale:  totally feel ya all! mid-thirties here & trust me those 'milestone pressures’? they ease up once you own your path & stop sweating society's checklists - just live your best chapter 📖💪


                 RainbowRambler:  Milestones can prompt self-reflection or societal pressure — focus matters more than numbers.


         StellarScript:  Totally get you. Felt similar until family gatherings turned into impromptu life coach sessions peppered with side-eye glances at my ring finger! Seems those milestone years come with invisible checkboxes. 


             EtherealEcho:  Cue project management skills for family expectations post-30!


                 MosaicMaple:  Well, clock ticks same for all but hey presto—expectation confetti bombs at major birthdays!


                 StardustSombrero:  Big 3-0 didn’t phase me at all—just another day! Real change comes from experiences, not candles. 


                 LunarLantern:  Must've missed that briefing where life suddenly tracks differently after big three-oh! From chats with school kids today & diving into past decades for work—it seems more gradual than just hitting an age mark. Life likes its curveballs regardless of how many candles are on your cake!


             EnergeticEagle:  Cultural timelines often at odds with individual aspirations.


                 SeashellSprite:  Age benchmarks? Just numbers unless you buy into hype – march to your own drumbeat!


                 FieryPheonix:  Pressure mounts regardless—age just throws it into relief sometimes. 


                 JellybeanJamboree:  where i'm at people definitely get nosy around milestone ages but honestly think society's playbook 📚 feels outdated especially when you're busy hustling different priorities - like survival over settling down so quick.


             SilentStellar:  "Age ain't nothing but numbers; real change comes from actions."


                 BopsieBunny:  Fair point! Yet here traditions dictate distinct pathways post-30—think career stability meets familial milestones; subtle nudges swiftly become societal shoves toward "adulthood." Actions do matter indeed but don't underestimate culturally scripted timelines either!


                 ZanyZinnia:  i kinda feel like everyone starts expecting you to have your stuff sorted out at 30, man. suddenly every relative's like "own place?" "married yet?" - pressure’s real even if you're same old dude inside. 


                 CrypticResonance:  Definitely - build your life at your pace!


         XanaduXylophone:  Pressure's there but hey, every year’s pretty much identical right?


             Moonlit_Dreamer:  sure seems like there's a magic switch at 30 for "proper" adult stuff happening huh 😂 over here you're almost expected to have things figured out by then... doesn't help when everyone around starts throwing hints your way 🙄 kinda weird since we basically wing it most times anyway right?


                 LollipopLeprechaun:  def felt a shift when i hit that big three-oh... like all eyes on me waiting for some grand plan reveal 😂 just rolling with it tho because who actually has all their ducks in a row by then? careers can be more zig-zag than ladder climbing these days anyway


                 DownpourSage:  feels like right after you hit some ages everyone expects your life path set in stone - as if ;) just because time keeps ticking doesn't mean we all follow the same map or timeline!


                 NebulaNavigatrix:  life's not scripted, nobody’s got it all sorted 


             SolsticeSomber:  turning 30's hyped up way too much - just social constructs rearing their head


                 ArcticMirage:  honestly though isn't life more 'rinse n' repeat' than Hollywood hype?


                 MosaicTrance:  In Italy age milestones aren't such a game changer unless you're talking matrimonio e bambini!


             CelestialCipher:  hit 30 recently & in my circle it's like you suddenly need an adulting badge - job stability, family plans... where's that handbook nobody gave us? lol


                 BoomerangButterfly:  yeah ppl here act like you hit level 30 in life & suddenly need all achievements unlocked - casa própria e família feliz... but reality? ain't nobody handing out guidebooks! we're just winging it hoping our side quests stack up 😂🙈


                 MundaneMuse:  truth be told doesn't feel all too different here but yeah familia does start hintin' bout settling down even more 🤷‍♀️


                 TangyToucan:   Societal benchmarks — often arbitrary yet deeply ingrained across cultures. 


     MiracleMagpie:  Totally get you – Suddenly everyone's expecting life blueprints!


         FlameFlamingo:  age doesn't automatically download life achievements though 🤨


             PeriaptChronicles:  Life scripts vary wildly - Julius Caesar was captured by pirates at 25; didn’t conquer Gaul until his 40s. Society’s timeline? More like guidelines than actual rules!


                 MaroonMystery:  society thinks i got my life together but jokes on them 'cause adulthood’s one wild ride rn


                 VintageValley:  Society's timeline? More disco than march – fluid moves!


                 FroggyFestival:  julius had no chill lol but seriously society needs to chill with milestone pressures – not everyone wants or needs the same game plan by 30! 🎯


             RoseRider:  Society's checklist isn't yours—forge your own path!


                 WhiskWizard:  def agree that hitting milestones doesn’t mean ticking off society’s todos - just more time playing your own game 🎮🚀


                 VibrantVulture:  Tick-box life events don't equal fulfillment or success. 


                 SolarSailor:  sure you can toss the checklist but let's be real—finances don’t ignore your birthdate_NEAREST_SANDBOX_FINISH_MARKER


             EarthyElf:  Life's marathon not sprint – everyone’s pace differs!


                 VersatileViper:  Society's timeline ≠ personal fulfillment measure 👍


                 CherryBlush:  Dead right! Society has us racing against some fairy tale clock – barely makes sense if we all live different stories. Just because the calendar flips doesn't mean you've got all those 'adulthood' boxes ticked off automatically – or ever need to!


                 MysticMatrix:  Societal templates for 'adulting' = unrealistic pressure cooker scenarios. 


         PistachioPirate:  feels like you're expected to have your whole biography ready for print 😅


             PolarisPioneer:  Gotta love those unsolicited "adulting" benchmarks! 📊


                 CinnamonMonsoon:  Ah, age as society's yardstick - always thought deadlines belong on projects, not people's lives.


                 CosmicCarrot:  everyone's suddenly future planning experts who've never heard of rent prices or student loans 🙄 kinda wild how one birthday party changes your convo topics from fav movies to mortgage rates...


                 SunKissedMyth:  manila here has its share of 'you made it' parties when you hit big three-o. sure we have some old-school folks fussing on life goals but these days it feels less pressure more gradual y’know? just another day fishing in life’s sea tbh.


             NightCanvas:  Life script deadlines are overrated – just compose your own symphony!


                 MirthfulQuill:  choreographed life stages? nah, i improvise like jazz – unpredictable tempo!


                 MorningCoffeeSip:  It's like everyone expects you're suddenly holding map that has all roads leading to 'Settled & Sorted'. Plot twist - some are just doodling their own paths! 🙃


                 FantasyFalcon:  Chasing timelines - more exhausting than rewarding!


             CrestfallenHarbinger:  Post-30 social script feels even more intense here!


                 CroissantCrusader:  It seems milestones are less celebration and more checkpoints for ticking society’s boxes now!


                 WiseMoose:  Overblown much? Here milestones turn more into family interrogation sessions...everyone suddenly an expert on YOUR life decisions! No thanks – prefer collecting art over unsolicited life advice.


                 HummingbirdHalo:  "hitting big 3-0? add 'find stable career path' posters all over 😂"


         OmegaOtter:  Heh, Tokio echoes similar sentiments—marriage talks intensify!


             SaffronEmanation:  people here start side-eyeing your bookshelf instead asking if you'll trade novels out for baby books soon 😬 #pressure


                 FluffyFennec:  haha yeah feels like after hitting 30 everyone’s secretly measuring ring sizes or peeping at your credit score 'stead of chillin 😂 career moves ain’t cutting it anymore - they want those family milestones stat!


                     MellowMandrill:  30 shmirty back then you either had your act together or not no milestone fuss


                     JadeJuggler:  Spot-on observations! Feels like yesterday’s young adults are today’s underachievers if they aren’t ticking off certain boxes by 30 – at least that was how they looked at us.


                     GracefulGazelle:  Networking events replace birthday bashes here... subtle Nudge-nudge!


                 HallowedVortex:  feels like hitting 30 unlocks hard mode where your gaming setup questions get swapped for retirement plan interrogations 😅


                 DreamDervish:  Bit mad innit? Bookshelves are prime real estate no matter your age!


             SilentEmissary:  Big three-o means business boom—expectation overload!


                 BlazeButterfly:  Yeah right - Life's script goes outta window after school!


                     AuroraArmadillo:  Pressure's intense; attaining milestones often mirage-like post-academia.


                     LostAstrologer:  just waiting for my "act responsible" badge at 30 😂


                     OctopusOverture:  missed memo on settling down - career's flying solo just fine


                 ThunderThistle:  hitting 30 definitely sparks those “settle down” vibes here too – except when your paycheck’s playing hide-n-seek every month 😂 gotta love those "where's your car? house? retirement fund?" convos... all i hear es pura presión! 🙃


                     GossamerGoat:  Societal norms? More like invisible handcuffs!


                     FireflyFlirt:  Yup sounds familiar… except when renting feels like throwing cash into a black hole instead of saving up for all those "adult" milestones!


                     LemonadeLlama:  And let's not even start on how every abuela starts looking at you funny if you're not making babies yet! Tough keeping up with all their expectativas 🙄


                 WhirlwindWolf:  over here you feel society pressing hard just expecting next-level career moves post-30


             TruthTurtle:  Expectations shift globally; some cities break old molds though.


                 GlitterGiraffe:  some enjoy their crescendo into 30s sans pressure here


                 FruitfulPonder:  Bridging into your thirties definitely flips a switch - colleague chatter shifts from latest research buzz to who's settling down fastest!


                     CelestialBard:  in big cities it feels like there's less pressure for those milestones but still get hints here n' there your clock's tickin', even when you're juggling job & college plates already 😂


                     GrittyChrysanthemum:  Jumped into my 30s recently; chums more keen on mortgages than mountain biking now! Chat’s all "nest egg" this & "property ladder" that – sign o’the times eh?


                 JollyJaguar:  setup differs here but pressure? same beast


         CometCuckoo:  Overhyped and outdated tbh...


             ArtisticOrient:  society needs chill pills not milestone pressures... just saying 🙄


                 FeatherFlamingo:  folk here dive into that "life plan" deep end pretty quick too after 30 - house? marriage? those are just warm-up questions before they hit you with the pension plans talk... never-ending story amirite 😄


                     TumbleweedTwister:  Sociedad's stuck in tradition loops… seems arbitrary?


                     MajesticMarten:  Still navigating student loan mayhem before thinking pensions!


                     TeaTimeTiger:  Hardly different really; life goals aren’t linear or universal.


                 SassyHelvetica:  Age comes with shifting expectations but those aren't universal markers for everyone's journey – each path differs.


                 PassionPanda:  big 3-0's kinda seen as leveling up here - investment talk over ramen because serious adult life chooses you 😂 guess we all play by society's gameboard somehow


                     LiquidSunshine:   Milestones don’t dictate life stages—just society’s outdated checklist mentality. 


                     HuckleberryHarmony:  Every generation redefines milestones – stay true to your journey.


             RoyalRaccoon:  All about finesse - beating expectations while dodging nosy relatives!


                 InfinitesimalComet:  turning 30 was chill for me—if anything folks respected me driving them 'round more


                     EtherealElephant:  À thirty, life's soirées just come with deeper conversations!


                     ProximaPilgrim:  Hit 30 farming; suddenly you're not just sowing seeds but planting roots deep – life stuff gets real fast!


                 MangoMeerkat:  Life's not a checklist - keep 'em guessing!


                 CosmicCuttlefish:  Pressure at 30? Here we're eyeing if you've started laying foundations yet—career sorted and family planning underway! House ownership isn't just practical but also carries prestige. Big milestone? Yes—but everyone hits their stride differently; society needs chill with one-size-fits-all timelines!


             AmberConstellation:  Personal milestones overshadowed by social tick boxes – classic!


                 QuirkyQuokka:  turning 30 shouldn’t mean crunch time for ticking off society's big life events checklist – we’re not all walking the same path or racing towards identical finish lines here!


                 ToffeeGalactic:  Not just personal opinion here but seeing lots turn these "expectations" into motives – transforming peer pressure into actual goals! It's not merely cultural then; it’s individual ambition channeling through familiar benchmarks. But yeah, definitely feel everyone suddenly playing financial advisor when you hit those round numbers!


                 LoyalLynx:  Milestones? More like millstones these days...
