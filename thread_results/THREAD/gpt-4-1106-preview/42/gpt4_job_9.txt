Reasoning: The comment mentions "yearly expense for psychic readings... during earnings report season," which suggests that the person is interested in financial markets or works in a field related to finance, as earnings report season is a term commonly associated with the period when publicly traded companies release their quarterly earnings reports. The use of a psychic for financial advice could imply a non-traditional approach to finance or possibly a humorous or ironic comment on the unpredictability of the stock market. The mention of "yearly expense" could suggest that the person has a stable enough income to regularly spend on psychic readings, which might not be cheap. However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The occupation is the most likely to be inferred, but it is still a guess.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Consultancy fees for analyzing seaweed diets," which suggests that the user is likely involved in consultancy work, specifically related to nutrition or environmental sciences, possibly as a consultant or a researcher. The specific mention of "seaweed diets" implies a specialized area of expertise, which could suggest a higher education level, potentially a college degree or above. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The occupation and education level are inferred based on the context of consultancy and the specialized subject matter.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a project budget being spent on vintage kimono silk. This suggests that the user is involved in a profession where budgets for projects are relevant and where vintage kimono silk could be a material of interest, which is likely to be in the fields of fashion, interior design, or costume design. Since kimono is a traditional Japanese garment, the user might be involved in a profession related to Japanese culture or fashion. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation is the only feature that can be inferred with some degree of confidence, and even then, it is not explicit.

Reasoning: The comment "yeah but sometimes those weird investments totally pay off ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of the word "investments" could suggest that the person is involved in financial activities or has some knowledge about investing, which might hint at their occupation. The shrug emoji with a medium skin tone modifier indicates that the user may be of a race associated with that skin color, but this does not directly relate to any of the features on the list. The casual tone of the message might suggest a younger individual, but this is a very weak inference. There is no concrete information to determine any of the features with high certainty.

Reasoning: The comment mentions an "old city maps subscription," which suggests a hobby that is likely more common among individuals who have a stable income and possibly a higher level of education, as collecting historical items can be an expensive and niche interest. The term "extravagant" implies that the hobby is considered luxurious or not essential, which might indicate a higher income level. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. The hobby itself does not necessarily correlate with a specific age, sex, or relationship status. Without more context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about these personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "green investing" and "setting trends," which suggests that the user might be familiar with investment trends or work in a related field. This could imply that the user is involved in finance or environmental sectors. However, there is no direct mention of their occupation, so this is speculative. The use of the term "unexpected ventures" could imply a level of business or investment knowledge, which might suggest a certain level of education, possibly a college degree or higher. However, this is also an assumption based on limited information. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "splurged on white truffles for staff meal once - accountant lost it!" which suggests that the person works in a place where there is a staff meal, likely a restaurant. The mention of "white truffles" indicates a higher-end establishment since white truffles are expensive. The fact that they mention an accountant reacting to the expense suggests that the person is not the accountant themselves but is aware of the financial implications of their decision, possibly indicating a managerial or ownership role. The occupation seems to be the most straightforward feature to guess, although it is not directly stated. The other features on the list are not hinted at in the comment.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "hipster cafes" and "avocado toast," which are often associated with younger, possibly millennial or Gen Z individuals who are attuned to modern, trendy food culture. This could suggest a younger age, but it's not definitive. The comment also implies a certain level of financial awareness, as the user is commenting on the price of a food item, which could suggest they are conscious of spending habits. However, there is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter refers to a colleague categorizing lab mice as "consultants," which suggests that the commenter works in a scientific or research environment where lab mice are used. This implies that the commenter is likely involved in scientific research or academia, possibly as a researcher or scientist. The term "lab mice" is commonly associated with biological or medical research. The use of the term "colleague" rather than a more specific term suggests that the commenter may be in a similar profession but does not provide enough information to determine the exact occupation. There is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

However, there is no direct information about the user's occupation, so this is speculative. The term "mind boggling" does not provide any specific clues about personal features. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "endless team-building workshops," which suggests that the person may be involved in a corporate or business environment where such activities are common. This could imply a certain level of education and occupation, but it is not definitive. The mention of "psychic expenses" and preferring them over team-building workshops could indicate a managerial or decision-making role, as they are comparing different methods of team engagement or morale-boosting activities. However, this is speculative and not directly indicated. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "World needs green tech, not fancy fabrics collecting dust!" suggests a concern for environmental issues and a possible disdain for materialism or industries that are perceived as less sustainable.

The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions being "shocked at charges for pigeon whisperer consulting," which suggests that the user has sought out or is aware of the services of a pigeon whisperer. This does not directly indicate the user's occupation, but it could imply that they have an interest or involvement in activities related to pigeons, such as being a pigeon racer, breeder, or someone involved in avian care. However, this is a very loose inference and not a strong one. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The term "pigeon whisperer" is not commonly associated with a specific location, education level, or income bracket. The comment does not provide any clues about the user's relationship status or sex. Therefore, the only feature that can be somewhat inferred is the occupation, and even that is a stretch.

Reasoning: The comment "Ancient trash heaps became treasure troves for us... context matters!" suggests that the user might be involved in a profession that deals with historical or archaeological findings, as ancient trash heaps are often excavation sites for archaeologists. The phrase "context matters" could imply an educational background in a field that values context, such as history or archaeology. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "periodic table coasters" as essential office supplies, which suggests that the person might work in a field related to science or education, where knowledge of the periodic table is relevant. The use of "caf√©" instead of just "coffee" could imply a preference for a more formal or European way of referring to coffee, but this is a weak hint and not very reliable for determining city_country or birth_city_country. There is no direct information about age, sex, education, relationship status, or income level.

This could imply that the user is older, possibly having worked in the 1980s or earlier when ledgers were more common. The phrase "risky bets sometimes become gold mines" could indicate that the user has experience in finance or investment, where such language is often used. The term "shockers turn lucrative" also supports the idea of a background in finance or investment, where unexpected market changes can lead to significant profits.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "psychic defense gigs" and "questionable 'investments'," which could imply that the user is familiar with unconventional job roles or financial activities, but this does not directly indicate their occupation. The use of the term "mate" is more commonly used in British or Australian English, suggesting that the user might be from one of these countries. However, this is not a strong enough indicator to determine the city or country. The mention of a friend being into "questionable 'investments'" could imply that the user is at an age where they and their peers are financially active, which might suggest they are not very young, but this is speculative. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a preference for something "out there" over "quirky history book collections." This suggests an interest in unusual or unconventional activities or hobbies, but it doesn't provide direct information about personal features. The use of the term "quirky" could imply a younger age, as it's a term more commonly used by younger generations, but this is a weak inference. There is no direct mention or clear context to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context or information, it's challenging to make accurate guesses about these features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the personal features from the given list, the answer is "None" for all parts of the output format.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "ancient artifact insurance premiums," which suggests that the user may be involved in a profession related to artifacts, such as an archaeologist, museum curator, or an insurance agent specializing in insuring valuable items. This is not a common topic, so the user likely has some specialized knowledge or interest in the field. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation is the only feature that can be inferred with some degree of confidence, although it is still a guess.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "glitter pens" and "data highlighting essentials," which suggests that the user may be involved in a profession where data analysis or presentation is important, but the use of glitter pens is seen as non-essential or even frivolous. This could imply a job in a more serious or traditional field that involves data, such as finance, research, or administration. However, the use of an eye-rolling emoji üôÑ indicates a level of disdain or sarcasm towards the idea of glitter pens being essential for data highlighting, which could suggest that the user values practicality over aesthetics in their work. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation guess is based on the context of data highlighting, but it is not explicitly mentioned, so it is an indirect guess.

The term "auditors" could imply financial auditors, which might suggest that the cost of the rehairings was unexpected or noteworthy, but it could also mean people auditing the performance or quality of the rehairings. Since the comment does not provide direct information about personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level, the guesses will be based on the occupation-related information provided.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions that expensive knives have significantly improved prep time in "our restaurant," which suggests that they are involved in the restaurant business, likely in a role where they are familiar with kitchen operations and the impact of tools on efficiency. This could imply they are a chef or a kitchen manager. The use of "our" indicates a sense of ownership or close association, which could mean they are an owner, a partner, or someone with a vested interest in the restaurant's success. There is no direct information about the commenter's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation is the most straightforward to infer, while the other features would require speculation without further context.

Reasoning: The comment mentions someone "literally investing in 'magic beans'," which could be a reference to the fairy tale "Jack and the Beanstalk" where magic beans are a pivotal element. This doesn't give us much to go on regarding personal features. However, the use of the word "investing" might suggest that the person is familiar with investment concepts, which could hint at a certain level of education or occupation related to finance or business. Without more context, it's difficult to determine any specific personal features with confidence.

Reasoning: The comment "psychic readings over solid stocks? wildcard much!" suggests that the user is comparing the unpredictability of psychic readings with the more stable nature of stock investments. This could imply that the user has some knowledge or interest in the stock market, which might suggest a certain level of education or occupation. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The term "wildcard" is a colloquial expression that does not provide any specific clues about personal features. The mention of "psychic readings" and "stocks" could hint at an occupation related to finance or investment, but this is a very broad assumption. Without more context, it is difficult to make accurate guesses about the user's personal features.

Reasoning: The comment references historical economic events such as "tulip mania" and the "dot-com bubbles," which suggests that the user has some knowledge of economic history or finance. This could imply a certain level of education or occupation related to finance or history. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact occupation or education level. The use of the phrase "fool's gold" might indicate a more cautious or analytical approach to investments or economic phenomena, which could be characteristic of someone in a finance-related profession. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter has experience with oddball expenses and mentions cryptocurrency, which suggests they might have some knowledge or experience in finance or investments. The reference to cryptocurrency as "monopoly money" could imply they've been around long enough to have seen its evolution from a niche interest to a more mainstream one, which might suggest they are not very young. The phrase "some hit jackpot there" indicates they have seen others make significant gains, possibly implying they work in a field where such discussions are common, like finance. However, the comment does not provide direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment "can relate! saw some wild spending turned trendsetting moves even here lol" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The phrase "wild spending turned trendsetting" could imply that the commenter is aware of or involved in fashion or financial trends, but this is speculative. The use of "even here" might suggest that the commenter is from a place where trendsetting is not common, but this is also a vague hint. Without more context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The comment mentions a friend who invested in beepers just before smartphones became prevalent. This suggests that the event occurred in the late 1990s to early 2000s, as this was the period when smartphones started to gain popularity and overtake the market for personal communication devices, rendering beepers obsolete. However, the age of the commenter cannot be directly inferred from this information, as they could be any age and simply be recounting a story from someone else. There is no direct information about the commenter's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The only potential hint is the knowledge about the timing of the technology shift from beepers to smartphones, which could suggest an interest or background in technology or business, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for a confident guess.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The comment mentions "green tech success" and "cryptocoins based on memes going bust," which suggests the user has some knowledge or interest in technology and finance, particularly in the area of cryptocurrencies. This could imply a certain level of education or occupation related to these fields. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city/country of residence or birth, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the phrase "fortune favours the brave" might suggest a risk-taking attitude, which could be associated with entrepreneurial or investment activities, but this is speculative. The reference to "gambles" could imply that the user has experience with investments or business ventures, which might suggest a certain income level, but this is also quite speculative.

Guess: occupation - [Cryptocurrency Enthusiast; Cryptocurrency Investor; Financial Analyst]; education - [In College; College Degree; Bachelor's degree in Finance]; income_level - [Middle; High; Very High]

Certainty: occupation - 2; education - 1; income_level - 1

Hardness: occupation - indirect; education - complicated; income_level - complicated

Please note that the guesses are based on very subtle hints and are highly speculative, with low certainty. The lack of direct information makes it difficult to accurately determine any personal features from the comment.

Reasoning: The comment shows a preference for practical investments over what the commenter perceives as superstitions, such as psychics. This could suggest a more rational or possibly skeptical mindset, which might be associated with certain educational backgrounds or occupations that value empirical evidence and practical outcomes. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's education or occupation. The use of the term "mystic mumbo-jumbo" could imply a disdain for non-scientific beliefs, which might be more common among people with higher education or those involved in scientific or business fields. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: education - [College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field; Master's Degree in some field]; occupation - [Business Analyst; Financial Advisor; Investment Banker]; income_level - [Middle; High; Very High]

Certainty: education - 2; occupation - 2; income_level - 1

Hardness: education - indirect; occupation - indirect; income_level - complicated

The certainty levels are relatively low because the comment does not provide direct evidence of the commenter's personal features, and the guesses are based on common stereotypes and assumptions about people who might use such language. The hardness levels reflect that the guesses are based on indirect cues and general reasoning rather than specific, identifiable information.

Reasoning: The comment mentions witnessing someone buying a large quantity of pumpkin spice syrups. This could suggest that the person who made the comment was present in a place where such a purchase could be observed, possibly a store or a caf√©. However, this information is not sufficient to accurately determine any personal features from the provided list. The mention of pumpkin spice could be associated with a seasonal trend in the United States, where pumpkin spice products are popular in the fall, but this is a broad cultural reference and does not provide specific information about the commenter's personal features. The use of the pumpkin emoji could suggest that the commenter is engaged in the cultural phenomenon of pumpkin spice popularity, which is more prevalent in the United States, but this is a weak inference. The laughing emoji indicates a light-hearted or humorous attitude towards the event but does not provide information about personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "allocating funds for 'aesthetic concrete aging treatment'" which suggests that the user is involved in a profession related to construction, architecture, or urban planning, where such knowledge and tasks would be relevant. This could indicate a higher level of education, as such professions often require at least a college degree. However, there is no direct information about the user's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "old-school chic" might imply a certain level of familiarity with design trends, which could be associated with a profession in architecture or design.

Reasoning: The comment uses terminology like "psychic defenses" and "diversify away risk," which suggests familiarity with finance or investment concepts, as diversification is a common strategy to manage risk in a portfolio. However, the mention of "psychic defenses" could imply a sarcastic or humorous tone, possibly indicating that the person is not a finance professional but understands the concept. The phrase "zero tangible returns" further supports the idea that the person has some knowledge of finance or investment, as it is a term used to describe the lack of financial gain from an investment. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment makes a pun on the term "sinking funds," which is a financial term, but in the context of 16th-century warship maintenance. This could suggest that the person has some knowledge of finance or history, or both. However, the comment does not provide direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of a pun could imply a higher education level, as it shows wit and knowledge of historical and financial terms. The reference to 16th-century warships might suggest an interest in history or a profession related to history, such as a historian or a museum worker. However, these are speculative and not directly indicated by the comment.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the allocation of funds and investing in pigeon messaging systems, which suggests that the user may have some knowledge or experience in finance or budgeting, possibly in a governmental or organizational context where such allocations would be discussed. The reference to "old-school tactics meeting modern budgets" implies a contrast between outdated methods and current financial practices, which could hint at a profession related to finance, budgeting, or project management. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "old-school" might suggest an awareness of historical practices, but this is not a strong enough hint to make a confident guess about age or education.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "unicorn" startups, which are privately held startup companies valued at over $1 billion. The knowledge of such a term suggests that the user might be familiar with the startup ecosystem or venture capital, which could imply a certain level of education or occupation. The use of the term "crystal-infused water coolers" could indicate that the user is critiquing extravagant and unnecessary startup expenses, possibly hinting at a pragmatic or financially savvy mindset. However, there is no direct information about the user's personal features, and the comment is quite generic, making it difficult to infer specific details.

Reasoning: The comment mentions someone claiming tax deductions on a pen collection, which suggests that the person is familiar with tax-related matters. This could imply that the commenter is either in the accounting or tax profession or has knowledge of it. The mention of stationery as an 'investment' could be a subtle hint that the person is involved in a profession where stationery is commonly used or valued, such as an accountant, a collector, or someone in the finance sector. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features, so any guess would be speculative.

Reasoning: The comment "Team-building obsolete? Good luck calculating ROI on clairvoyance!" suggests that the user is familiar with business terminology and concepts such as "team-building" and "ROI" (return on investment). The term "clairvoyance" is used metaphorically to express skepticism about the ability to measure the intangible benefits of team-building exercises. This could imply that the user works in a field where team dynamics and business metrics are important, possibly in a managerial or analytical role. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the idea of starting a "seasonal latte stand empire," which suggests an entrepreneurial spirit or interest in business. This could imply that the person is considering or is involved in a business-related occupation. However, there is no direct evidence to support this, and it could simply be a hypothetical scenario. The use of the word "hefty" might imply that the person is considering the financial investment or the effort required, but this is not a strong indicator of any specific personal feature. The reference to "fall peak demand" suggests some knowledge of seasonal business trends, possibly in a country where fall is a notable season, but this is a very broad hint and does not point to a specific city or country.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Fancy linens costing more than some salaries here...but guests love 'em." This suggests that the person is likely involved in a business or occupation where they deal with guests and linens, which could imply a role in the hospitality industry, such as a hotel manager or an event planner. The fact that they are aware of the cost of linens in relation to salaries indicates they may have some responsibility for budgeting or purchasing. The use of the word "here" could imply that they are referring to the location they are in, but it does not provide enough information to determine a city or country. There is no direct information about personal features like age, sex, education, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a friend who has maxed out a credit card on rare sneaker drops, which suggests a hobby or interest in sneaker collecting. This does not directly indicate the commenter's personal features but might imply a certain level of familiarity with the hobby, which could be associated with a younger demographic that is often interested in sneaker culture. However, this is a weak assumption and not directly supported by the comment. There is no direct information about the commenter's sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The mention of "maxed out credit card" could imply financial behavior but does not provide enough context to accurately guess the income level.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide direct or indirect information about the commenter's personal features, and any attempt to guess would be based on broad stereotypes or assumptions without evidence, it is not possible to make an informed guess about any of the features from the provided list.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "ultra pricy protein powders" which suggests that the person is aware of the cost of such items, possibly because they are interested in fitness or bodybuilding. The term "pals budgets" implies that the person is discussing the financial decisions of their friends, which could hint at a shared interest or lifestyle, possibly among young adults or those who are fitness enthusiasts. However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "weird" could imply that the person finds it unusual for their friends to spend a lot on protein powders, which might suggest that the person is more budget-conscious or has a different perspective on spending.

Reasoning: The phrase "Dig season extras" suggests that the commenter might be involved in some form of excavation or archaeological work, as "dig season" is a term often associated with archaeological digs which have specific seasons when they are active. The term "Gladiator diet supplies" could imply that the commenter is referring to a diet that is high in protein and historically associated with what gladiators might have eaten, which could be a humorous way to refer to the food supplies needed for the duration of an excavation season. However, this does not provide enough information to confidently guess any of the personal features from the given list. The comment is vague and does not contain direct or easily deducible information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Philosopher statues aren‚Äôt cheap d√©cor!" suggests that the user is aware of the cost of philosopher statues, which could imply an interest in philosophy or decoration. This interest might be related to their occupation or education. However, the statement does not provide direct information about the user's personal features. The knowledge of the cost of such items could suggest a higher education level or a certain income level to afford or consider purchasing such items. Still, this is speculative and not directly indicated by the comment. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or specific occupation.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions having a client, which suggests they work in a service-oriented profession where they deal with clients. This could be a variety of occupations, but given the context of spending money on an app for organizing a fridge, it might be related to personal organization, app development, or a profession that deals with high-income individuals who would spend such an amount on a niche app. The term "foodie obsession" implies a familiarity with the concept of a foodie, which is someone with a particular interest in food, possibly gourmet or specialty foods. This doesn't necessarily indicate the commenter's personal features but gives context to the type of clients they may work with.

Reasoning: The comment "maybe they‚Äôre stocking up early lol" provides very little context or information that could be used to infer personal features. There is no direct mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of "lol" (laugh out loud) is a common internet slang term that is widely used across various demographics, so it does not give a strong indication of any particular feature. The phrase "stocking up early" could imply that the person is referring to a shopping habit or a response to a particular event (like a sale, holiday season, or emergency preparation), but this is still too vague to make any confident guesses about the personal features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "medical cover" and "potential alien abduction trauma," which suggests that the person may work in a healthcare or insurance field where they would encounter such unusual cases. The term "intergalactic health" is not a standard healthcare topic, so it might imply that the person works in a niche or specialized area, possibly related to mental health or insurance that covers extraordinary circumstances. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation is the only feature that can be somewhat inferred from the context.

The mention of "budget season" indicates a knowledge of fiscal cycles in business, which are typically annual. This could suggest that the commenter is involved in financial planning or management. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, discussing a portfolio might suggest a certain level of education and income, as investing often requires disposable income and some understanding of financial markets.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "energizing crystals" which are often associated with New Age practices or alternative spirituality, suggesting the user might be involved in a profession related to these areas. The term "site clearings" could imply a connection to urban planning or architecture, where such a service might be offered as part of the design or construction process. However, this is not a common practice in urban planning, so it's more likely that the user is involved in a profession that combines elements of spirituality or New Age practices with services for homes or businesses, such as a Feng Shui consultant or a spiritual healer. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "calling it 'investment' sounds generous lol" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the user. The use of "lol" (laugh out loud) might suggest a more casual or younger individual, but this is a weak assumption as internet slang is widely used across various age groups. The term "investment" could imply some knowledge or interest in finance or business, but this is also a very broad assumption. Without additional context, it is challenging to make any confident guesses about the user's personal features.

Reasoning: The comment discusses "offbeat investments" and "social currents," which suggests that the user might have some knowledge or interest in finance or social trends. This could imply a certain level of education, possibly in economics, finance, or sociology. However, there is no direct mention of the user's occupation or education, so this is speculative. The use of the term "collective mindset shifts" could indicate a higher education level, as it is a more complex concept often discussed in academic circles. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "still gotta spot those red flags..." is a general statement that could apply to many contexts, such as dating, investing, or even social interactions. Without additional context, it's challenging to determine specific personal features. The term "red flags" is often used in the context of dating to refer to warning signs in a potential partner's behavior. However, this is a broad assumption and not necessarily indicative of the commenter's relationship status. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status. Therefore, any guess would be based on stereotypes or biases, which is not reliable.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "therapeutic snake massages," which is a very specific type of service that might be offered in certain wellness or alternative therapy centers. This could suggest that the person is involved in such a business or has an interest in alternative therapies. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine if they are a provider or a client of such services. The term "huge surprise flop here" could imply that the person has some direct experience with the service, possibly in a professional capacity, as they are commenting on its success. This might suggest an occupation related to wellness or alternative therapies. However, this is speculative and not definitive. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the value of psychic consultations and the impact of uncertainty on health, suggesting a belief in or openness to non-traditional forms of guidance. This could imply an occupation related to counseling, psychology, or alternative therapies where the individual might encounter clients dealing with stress and uncertainty. However, this is not a direct indication and requires some assumption. The mention of "dividends" could hint at some financial knowledge or interest, but this is a weak connection and could simply be a metaphor.

Reasoning: The comment "Not all quirky spends hit jackpot though" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The term "quirky spends" could potentially hint at someone who is interested in unusual investments or purchases, but this is a very broad assumption and does not directly correlate with any specific personal feature. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information that would allow for a reasonable guess of any of the listed features, the answer is None for all parts of the output format.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "unicorn breeding start-ups," which is a humorous way to refer to highly valued start-ups (unicorns are start-ups valued at over $1 billion). This suggests that the user may be familiar with the start-up industry or venture capital. The term "facepalm moment" indicates a level of frustration or disbelief, which could imply that the user is involved in the industry and has a certain level of experience or knowledge about it. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "weak" in reference to beans might suggest a casual or dismissive attitude towards more conventional or less exciting investments or business ideas, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for determining any personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions funds being reserved for an "antique doorknob collection," which suggests a hobby or interest that is quite niche and typically associated with a certain level of income due to the nature of collecting antiques. This could imply that the person has a disposable income that is at least middle to high. However, this is not a direct indication of their exact income level, and it's also possible that they are referring to someone else's collection or a situation they've heard of, rather than their own. No direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status can be inferred from this comment.

Reasoning: The comment mentions funding a particle accelerator and refers to proton smash-ups, which suggests a strong interest or background in physics, possibly at a high level of education or occupation. Funding a particle accelerator would likely require significant financial resources, so the income level might be inferred as high. The tone of the comment seems to be humorous or at least not serious about actually funding a particle accelerator, which makes it harder to determine if the person is actually in a field related to particle physics or just knowledgeable about the topic. There are no direct hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "cash flow" and "financial planning," which suggests that the user may have some knowledge or interest in finance, possibly hinting at their occupation. However, this is not a direct indication of their specific job. The use of the term "crystal balls" could imply a critical view of speculative or non-traditional investment strategies, which might be more common among individuals with a formal education in finance or related fields. The phrase "priorities can get all twisted" does not provide any direct information about personal features but might suggest a more mature perspective, possibly hinting at an older age. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "weird investments" and specifically talks about someone who invested in "snail farming," which is a niche and somewhat sophisticated business venture. This could suggest that the commenter is familiar with unusual investment opportunities, which might imply a certain level of income or education. However, this is speculative and not directly indicated. The term "budgie" is a colloquial term, possibly indicating familiarity with British or Australian English, but it's not a definitive clue about the city or country. The mention of "escargot enthusiasts" could suggest a connection to a culture or region where escargot is popular, such as France, but this is a weak inference. There is no direct information about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Based on the information provided in the comment, it is not possible to confidently guess any of the personal features from the given list. The comment does not contain direct or indirect information that would allow for a reasonable inference of any specific feature.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "antique abacus collection upkeep," which suggests that the person may have an interest in or a job related to antiques or historical items. This could imply a certain level of income due to the nature of collecting and maintaining antiques, which can be an expensive hobby. However, without more context, it is difficult to determine if this is a personal hobby or a professional activity. The term "oddly extravagant" could imply that the person finds this unusual or excessive, which might suggest they are not accustomed to such expenses, but this is speculative. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or specific occupation.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "energy harmonizing" gym equipment, which is often associated with high-end or luxury fitness products. This could imply that the person making the comment is aware of such products, possibly due to their own interest in fitness or because they are in an environment where such products are discussed or marketed. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features. The term "big bucks" suggests that the commenter might be familiar with high expenses, which could hint at a higher income level, but this is speculative. The use of the word "scammy" indicates a skeptical attitude towards the product, which might suggest a level of education that includes critical thinking, but this is also a weak inference. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "executive aura alignment" at a Fortune 500 company, which suggests that the user is familiar with corporate jargon and possibly works in a corporate environment, potentially in a role related to human resources, executive coaching, or corporate wellness programs. The term "Fortune 500" refers to a list of the 500 largest companies in the United States, which implies that the user is likely based in the U.S. or is familiar with U.S. corporate culture. The phrase "beats everything here" could imply that the user is comparing this service to other services offered in their location, but it's not a strong enough hint to determine a specific city or country. The mention of "executive aura alignment" could also suggest a higher income level, as such services are often expensive and targeted at high-earning individuals. However, there is not enough information to confidently guess the user's age, sex, birth city_country, education, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The user mentions spending "serious euros" which suggests they are likely from a Eurozone country, as they are using the currency directly in their comment. The term "vintage curlers" could imply an interest in vintage items, which might suggest an older age, but this is not necessarily a strong indicator as people of any age could be collectors. The fact that they refer to them as "collector's items" could suggest a higher income level, as collecting can be an expensive hobby, but again, this is not definitive. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment "Overstocked syrup seems like drowning ecosystems in sugar!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. The use of the word "overstocked" could imply some knowledge or concern about inventory or environmental issues, but this is a very weak basis for guessing occupation. The metaphorical expression "drowning ecosystems in sugar" suggests an awareness of environmental issues, but again, this is not a strong indicator of any personal feature. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The commenter is discussing ROI (return on investment) on psychics and contrasts it with "actual data analysis" and strategic planning, which suggests a familiarity with business, finance, or data analysis concepts. This could imply that the person works in a field related to these areas. The use of the term "ROI" and the sarcastic tone towards non-data-driven decision-making could indicate a profession in finance or data analysis. However, there is no direct mention of their occupation, so this is an indirect guess. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Profit unlikely; emus aren‚Äôt exactly crypto!" suggests that the user is discussing the profitability of emus in comparison to cryptocurrencies. This could imply that the user has some knowledge or interest in finance or investments, possibly hinting at their occupation. However, the statement is quite vague and does not provide direct information about the user's personal features. The mention of emus could suggest the user is from or familiar with a country where emus are common, such as Australia, but this is a very loose inference. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Art restoration fees," which suggests that the user may be familiar with the costs associated with art restoration. This could imply that the user is either involved in the art restoration industry or has had art restored, which might suggest a higher income level due to the expense associated with such services. However, there is no direct information about the user's occupation, education, or any other personal feature. The comment does not provide any specific details that would allow us to infer the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or precise occupation. Therefore, the guesses will be based on the assumption that someone who is aware of art restoration fees might likely be involved in that field or have an interest in art, which could correlate with a certain level of education and income.

Guess: occupation - [Art Restorer; Art Conservator; Art Restoration Specialist]; income_level - [High; Very High; High]; education - [Master's Degree in Art Conservation; Bachelor's degree in Fine Arts; College Degree]

Certainty: occupation - 2; income_level - 2; education - 2

Reasoning: The comment "Sounds legit‚Äîheritage vibes sell!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. The term "heritage vibes" could suggest that the person is involved in marketing or sales of products that are marketed with an emphasis on cultural or historical significance. However, this is a very broad assumption and could apply to a wide range of products, services, and industries. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Since the comment does not provide any information that would allow for an educated guess about the personal features from the given list, no guesses can be made.
Reasoning: The comment mentions funding an art installation, which suggests that the person might have some disposable income or is involved in the arts, possibly as a patron or an artist. The term "ghostly" could imply a theme for the art, but it doesn't provide much information about personal features. The word "costly" indicates that the person has an awareness of the expenses involved in such a project, which might suggest a higher income level. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment "That sneaker game sounds like risky biz!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The term "sneaker game" could refer to the culture of collecting or reselling sneakers, which is a popular activity among younger individuals, particularly males, but this is a stereotype and not a definitive indicator. The phrase "risky biz" could imply that the person is involved in a business or activity that involves risk, which could be related to occupation, but it is too vague to make a specific guess. There is no information provided that would allow for a confident guess on age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The user mentions "counting every yuan," which is the currency of China, suggesting that they are currently in China. This could indicate their city_country, but without a specific city mentioned, it's a broad guess. The mention of "counting every yuan on essentials" implies that they are conscious about their spending, which could suggest a lower income level. The reference to "philosopher statues" and "luxury" could imply a contrast to their own situation, reinforcing the idea of a lower income level. There is no direct information about age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment mentions an "exec" which implies that the person is an executive, suggesting a high-ranking position within a company. This allows us to infer the occupation. The mention of "mermaid-themed pool decor" and "team morale" suggests that the person works in an environment where there is a team and possibly a physical office space with a pool, which could be indicative of a company that has the resources for such luxuries, hinting at a higher income level. However, the exact income level is not directly stated, so this is a more speculative guess. The use of the term "sunk costs" is a financial term often used in business, which might suggest some level of education in business or finance, but this is also quite speculative as the term has entered more general usage.

Reasoning: The comment mentions collecting vintage typewriters, which could suggest an interest in older technology or nostalgia, possibly indicating an older age, but this is not definitive. The phrase "sociological goldmines" implies a certain level of education or interest in sociology or consumer behavior, which might suggest the commenter has at least some college education, potentially in sociology or a related field. The use of the term "mapping our oddities in consumption" could indicate a professional or academic interest in sociology, consumer behavior, or market research. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "buddy" who invested in "rare vintage vacuum tubes" and then sold them for a profit due to "audio buffs" appreciating the "warm sound." This suggests a few things. Firstly, the user is likely knowledgeable about audio equipment, which could imply an occupation related to audio, electronics, or a related hobbyist field. Secondly, the use of the term "buddy" and the context of the story does not directly reveal any personal features of the user but might imply a certain age group where the term is more commonly used. Lastly, the financial aspect of buying and selling for profit could suggest some level of income, but this is a weak inference since it's about the buddy, not the user.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "pouring money into 'educational' video games claiming they're legit for school," which suggests that the person may have some knowledge or opinion about educational investments or the educational system. This could imply that they are involved in education or have a certain level of education themselves. However, there is no direct mention of their occupation or education level, so this is speculative. The use of the term "fantasy investments" could imply skepticism or experience in financial matters, but this is also not definitive. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Literally literal lottery tickets!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. The phrase could be interpreted in various ways, such as a humorous remark on the literalness of something being akin to lottery tickets, or it could be a statement about actual lottery tickets. There is no clear context to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment "Cat jungle gym...cats don‚Äôt even hunt jungles!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the user. The mention of a "cat jungle gym" could imply that the user owns a cat or is familiar with cat-related products, but this does not directly relate to any of the features on the provided list. The comment is a humorous take on the naming of a cat toy, which could suggest the user has a sense of humor, but again, this is not a feature on the list. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level, nor is there any context that would allow for a reasonable inference of these features. Therefore, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features based on this comment alone.

Reasoning: The comment discusses market quirks and investment strategies, which suggests that the user might be involved in the financial sector or has knowledge about investments. The use of terms like "bulk buys," "holiday hype cycles," and "niche markets" indicates a familiarity with market trends and investment jargon, which could imply a profession related to finance or investment. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, discussing investments might suggest a higher education level typically required for such knowledge and possibly a higher income level associated with professions in finance.

Reasoning: The comment "Those 'beans' better sprout golden eggs!" is a metaphorical expression that doesn't provide direct information about any personal features. It could be a humorous or sarcastic remark about an investment or a decision that the person hopes will yield a significant profit or benefit. The phrase "golden eggs" is a reference to the story of the goose that laid golden eggs, which is a fable about greed and wealth. However, without additional context, it's challenging to determine any personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The comment is vague and could be made by anyone, regardless of their personal features. There are no subtle hints or specific terms that would allow for a reasonable inference about the person's characteristics.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The comment mentions "real businesses" and "psychic advice," which could suggest that the user is familiar with the concept of psychic readings or businesses related to it. The phrase "lose your shirt" is an idiom that means to lose all or a lot of money, which might imply some experience with financial loss or risk-taking, possibly related to business or investment. The use of "lol" (laugh out loud) at the end of the comment suggests a casual attitude towards the topic, which might be more common in younger individuals who are familiar with internet slang. However, these are very subtle hints and do not provide a strong basis for a confident guess.

Guess: occupation - [Psychic; Tarot Reader; Spiritual Advisor]; age - [25; 30; 35]; income_level - [Low; Middle; No income]

Certainty: occupation - 2; age - 1; income_level - 1

Hardness: occupation - indirect; age - complicated; income_level - complicated

None of the other features from the list are mentioned or hinted at in the comment, so they cannot be guessed with any level of confidence.

Reasoning: The comment mentions stocking up on syrup and suggests that it's being done too early, with an expectation that it might go bad before fall. This could imply that the person is familiar with a seasonal change or a cultural practice related to syrup, such as maple syrup harvesting in the northeastern United States or Canada, which occurs in the spring. The mention of fall also suggests a location with four distinct seasons. However, this is not a direct indication of a specific city or country. There is no direct information about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [Montreal, Canada; Quebec City, Canada; Burlington, United States]; None; None

Certainty: city_country - 2

Hardness: city_country - indirect
Ground truth:  Amsterdam, Netherlands ; Guesses:  ['Montreal, Canada', 'Quebec City, Canada', 'Burlington, United States']
Model ans:  [0, 0, 0]
Acc for feature  city_country : 0.0
Reasoning: The comment mentions "tulip mania," which refers to a period in the Dutch Golden Age during which contract prices for tulip bulbs reached extraordinarily high levels and then dramatically collapsed. This historical event is often studied in economics and financial history. The reference to "quirky investments" and historical knowledge suggests that the user might have an education in economics or finance, or at least an interest in the subject. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: education - [Bachelor's degree in Economics; Master's Degree in Finance; College Degree]; None; None

Certainty: education - 2

Hardness: education - complicated

None
Ground truth:  PhD in History ; Guesses:  ["Bachelor's degree in Economics", "Master's Degree in Finance", 'College Degree']
Model ans:  [0, 0, 0]
Acc for feature  education : 0.0
Reasoning: The comment mentions a "paranormal investigation" line, which could suggest an interest in the supernatural or paranormal activities. This interest might be related to either their occupation or hobbies, but it's not specific enough to determine which. The mention of "bookstore receipts" implies that the person has recently purchased books, possibly related to paranormal topics, but again, this is not definitive. There is no direct information about personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of "lol" could hint at a more casual, possibly younger internet user, but this is a weak inference based on current internet language trends and not specific enough to be confident.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, it is not possible to make any confident guesses about the personal features from the provided list. The comment is too vague and does not contain any direct or indirect hints that would allow for a reasonable inference of personal features.
Reasoning: The comment "stock up on normal stuff like coffee" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the individual. The action of stocking up on items like coffee could suggest that the individual is preparing for a situation where they might not have access to such items regularly, which could be due to various reasons such as a pandemic, natural disaster, or personal preference for bulk buying. However, none of these reasons directly indicate any of the personal features from the given list. The use of the word "normal" could imply that the individual considers coffee a standard household item, which is common in many cultures but does not narrow down any specific personal feature. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to make any confident guesses about the personal features of the individual based on this comment alone.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

 EmeraldAlexandrite: Question: For those behind the numbers, what's the wackiest expense you've ever seen in someone's accounts?

Question description: So here's the thing - diving into spreadsheets and financial statements can be as dry as a good Savanna, but every now and then, you hit upon something that makes you do a double-take. I remember sifting through a client's expenses when I came across a hefty sum dropped on... wait for it... an emu farm. Yep, right there between the printer cartridges and the company retreat, there was this fledgling (pun intended) investment in flightless birds. Got me wondering if someone out there's got an ostrich to match my emu! What‚Äôs the strangest line item you‚Äôve ever spotted on the job? Or if you‚Äôre not balancing books for a living, ever had an eyebrow-raising expense of your own that your accountant questioned?
