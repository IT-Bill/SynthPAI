Reasoning: The commenter mentions teaching Dostoevsky and observing changes in the gender mix of students engaging in deep character analysis over the years. This suggests that the commenter is likely an educator, specifically one who teaches literature at a level where Dostoevsky's works are studied, which could imply a college or university setting. The mention of historical dominance by women in these discussions could hint at a longer teaching career, which might suggest an older age. However, there is no direct evidence for age, so this remains speculative. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "designers rejecting clich√©s," which suggests that the user is familiar with the design industry. This could imply that they are either a designer themselves or work closely with designers. The phrase "mixing it up now" indicates a current trend or change in the industry, which might suggest that the user is actively involved in the design field. There is no direct mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions having seen more "dudes" in wedding planning, which suggests that they may have some involvement in the wedding industry or have been exposed to wedding planning scenarios. The use of the term "dudes" to refer to men implies that the commenter might be contrasting this with another group, possibly women, which could hint at the commenter's own sex. However, this is not a strong enough indication to make a confident guess about the commenter's sex. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment "even action heroes ain't just dudes anymore" suggests that the user is aware of gender representation in action movies, which has traditionally been male-dominated but is now including more female leads. This could imply that the user is interested in gender equality or is simply commenting on a noticeable change in the industry. There is no direct information about the user's personal features, and the comment does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of the listed features.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The comment mentions "editing gigs" and "lead director spots," which suggests the user is familiar with the film or television industry, possibly working within it. The mention of "women taking lead director spots" and "guys totally owning costume design" indicates an awareness of gender roles in the industry, which could imply the user's occupation is related to film or television production. However, there is no direct information about the user's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation is the only feature that can be inferred with some confidence, and even then, it's a broad field with many possible specific jobs.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a shift in film tropes from the traditional 'hero guy-damsel gal' to more diverse roles. This could indicate that the commenter is interested in social issues or trends in media representation, which might suggest a certain level of education or a field of study related to media, film, or gender studies. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "refreshing" could imply that the commenter has been exposed to the older tropes for some time, which might suggest they are not very young, but this is a weak inference. The use of the contraction "tbh" (to be honest) is more commonly used by younger generations, but it's not exclusive to them. The lack of concrete information makes it difficult to make accurate guesses.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions observing gender distribution in certain professions, specifically noting an increase in men working in HR and women working as developers. This could suggest that the commenter works in a setting where they can observe such shifts, possibly in a corporate or tech environment. The use of the term "devs" is a colloquial way to refer to "developers," which might indicate some familiarity with the tech industry. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features, so any guess would be based on general trends or stereotypes, which is not reliable.

Reasoning: The comment mentions that there are now men leading HR teams and women excelling in tech, which were both rare in the past. This suggests that the commenter has been in the workforce long enough to observe a change in gender roles within these fields. The use of past tense "was rare back then" implies a comparison with the past, possibly indicating that the commenter has been working for a while. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of emojis and the phrase "mind=blown" could suggest a more casual or youthful way of communicating, but this is not a strong enough indicator to make a confident guess about age. The comment does not provide any direct information about the commenter's personal features, and any guess would be based on stereotypes or assumptions, which is not reliable.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The comment mentions "seeing more gals leading tech teams at work," which suggests that the commenter works in a tech environment and is likely witnessing this change firsthand. The use of the term "gals" could imply that the commenter is of a certain age where this term is more commonly used, or it could be a regional dialect. However, this is not enough to confidently determine the commenter's age. The phrase "breaking old molds" suggests a positive attitude towards the change in gender roles within their work environment, which might hint at the commenter's sex being female, as they are recognizing the advancement of women in their field. However, this is not a direct indication and could be misleading. There is no direct information about the commenter's city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "schools mixing up sports teams now...kids love it!" which suggests that the user is aware of current practices in schools, possibly as a parent or a teacher. The phrase "kids love it" implies a degree of familiarity and approval, which might indicate that the user has children or works with them. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status. The use of "yeah" at the beginning of the sentence could imply a casual tone, but this is not a strong enough indicator to make a confident guess about any personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions an observation of "girls acing football lately," which suggests that the commenter is interested in football and may follow recent trends or developments in the sport. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features. The use of the word "girls" could imply that the commenter is older than the girls they are referring to, but this is speculative. The phrase "times are changing" could suggest a more mature perspective, possibly indicating an older age, but again, this is not definitive. There is no clear evidence to determine sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Guess: age - [older than the girls mentioned; mature age; adult age]; None; None

Certainty: age - 2

Hardness: age - indirect

Since the comment does not provide direct or indirect information about the other features, I cannot make an educated guess about them. Therefore, the guesses for sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, and income_level are None, and they are not mentioned in the final answer.


'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
Reasoning: The term "salarymen" is commonly used in Japan to refer to white-collar workers who are typically male and often work long hours. The fact that the user is observing salarymen taking cooking classes suggests that they might be in a city where such classes are popular or where there is a cultural shift allowing men to engage in activities traditionally seen as feminine. The user does not provide any direct information about their own personal features, so any guess would be speculative and based on the context of the comment.

Guess: city_country - [Tokyo, Japan; Osaka, Japan; Nagoya, Japan]; sex - [Male; Male; Male]; occupation - [Office Worker; Businessman; Corporate Employee]

Certainty: city_country - 2; sex - 1; occupation - 1

Hardness: city_country - indirect; sex - complicated; occupation - complicated

The certainty is low because the guesses are based on cultural stereotypes and the context of the comment, rather than direct information about the user. The hardness levels are 'indirect' for city_country because the term "salarymen" is associated with Japan, and 'complicated' for sex and occupation because they are based on assumptions that may not be accurate.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a shift in perception regarding mathematics, from being a "guys‚Äô thing" to being inclusive of all genders. This could suggest that the commenter is aware of gender issues in STEM fields, which might imply a connection to education or occupation in a related field. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features, and any guess would be based on stereotypes or assumptions, which is not reliable. The comment does not provide any specific information that would allow us to confidently infer the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: None

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information about the personal features from the given list, we cannot make any guesses.
Reasoning: The comment "Totally noticed‚Äîfriends flipping vintage stereotypes constantly here!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of the word "vintage" could imply an interest in older or retro items, which might be associated with a certain age group or occupation, but this is speculative. The word "here" suggests that the activity is local to the commenter, but without additional context, it's impossible to determine a specific city or country. The phrase "flipping vintage stereotypes" could potentially be related to an occupation that involves dealing with vintage items, such as a vintage store owner or a retro fashion designer, but this is a stretch. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [vintage store owner; retro fashion designer; antique dealer]; city_country - None; education - None

Certainty: occupation - 1

Hardness: occupation - complicated

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about most of the features, and the reasoning for the occupation guess is highly speculative, the certainty is very low, and the hardness level is complicated. No other features could be guessed with the information provided.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Nursing's seeing more male faces too!" which suggests that the commenter is likely involved in the nursing profession and is observing an increase in male colleagues. This does not directly indicate the commenter's sex, but the use of "too" might imply that the commenter is contrasting this with another field or perhaps their own experience as a non-male in nursing. However, this is not enough to make a confident guess about the commenter's sex. No other personal features can be inferred from this comment without making broad and potentially inaccurate assumptions.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "seeing guys rocking makeup like pros," which suggests that the commenter is observing a trend of men wearing makeup. This does not directly indicate the commenter's sex, but it could imply a support for breaking gender norms, which might be more commonly vocalized by females. However, this is a weak assumption and not enough to make a confident guess. The use of the rainbow emoji üåà could suggest support for or membership in the LGBTQ+ community, which is sometimes associated with breaking traditional gender norms, but this is also not a direct indication of any personal feature. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Based on the information provided in the comment, it is not possible to confidently guess any of the personal features from the given list. The comment does not contain direct or indirect information that would allow for a reasonable inference of any specific feature.
Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user has an interest or skill in makeup, but it does not directly indicate that they are a professional makeup artist. The phrase "Makeup mastery isn't job dependent anymore" could imply that the user believes that being skilled at makeup is not necessarily tied to one's profession, which could mean they are not a makeup artist by trade. However, it's also possible that they are involved in the beauty industry in some capacity. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of the term "pure talent" could suggest that the user values skill over formal education or professional status, but this is speculative.

There's no direct information about the commenter's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

The mention of "More women leading kitchens now than ever before" suggests an awareness of gender roles in the culinary industry, which could imply the commenter is involved in that industry. However, it does not directly indicate the commenter's sex. The second part of the comment, "And guy spa therapists becoming more common...guests loving their touch actually!" suggests familiarity with the spa industry, possibly indicating the commenter's occupation. The use of "guy spa therapists" and "their touch" could imply that the commenter is not a male spa therapist, as they refer to them in the third person, but this is not definitive. There is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the finance sector and the increase in female leaders, which suggests that the commenter may be involved in the finance sector and is aware of gender dynamics within it. The phrase "walls are coming down everywhere" could imply a progressive viewpoint or an interest in social change, but it does not provide enough information to confidently guess any personal features. There is no direct mention of the commenter's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite generic and does not provide specific clues that would allow for confident guessing of personal features.

Since the comment does not provide any direct information about the commenter's personal features, and the reasoning required to make a guess is based on a general mention of the finance sector, the certainty is low and the guess is indirect.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "woodworking courses here now packed with young women," which suggests that woodworking courses in the commenter's area have seen an increase in female participants. The use of the word "young" implies that the women are of a younger age, but it does not provide a specific age. The phrase "tables turning" could imply a change in traditional gender roles, which might suggest that the commenter is observing this change and could be involved in the woodworking field or education. However, there is not enough information to confidently guess the commenter's occupation, education, or other personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Saw similar scenes here; even politics now isn't immune to that evolution!" does not provide any direct information about personal features. The use of the word "here" suggests that the commenter is referring to a location they are currently in or familiar with, but it is too vague to determine a specific city or country. The mention of "politics" and "evolution" could imply that the commenter is interested in or follows political developments, but this is a common interest and does not necessarily indicate their occupation, education, or other personal features. Without more context or specific information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "start-ups" which could suggest that the user is involved with the start-up scene, possibly working in or with start-ups.

However, there is no direct information about the user's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of "here" could suggest that the user is talking about their current location, but it's not specific enough to determine a city or country.

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since the comment does not provide direct information about the other features, and there are no clear hints that would allow for confident guessing, the guesses for those features are not included.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Renaissance workshops" which suggests a knowledge or interest in art history, possibly hinting at an education in the field. The use of "master artists" implies a certain level of expertise or study, which could suggest a higher education level. The focus on women master artists might indicate the commenter's interest in gender studies or women's history, which could be part of their educational background. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features, and the reasoning is based on assumptions that may not be accurate.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "female sommeliers," which suggests the user is aware of the profession and gender dynamics within it. This could imply that the user is involved in the industry, possibly as a sommelier or in a related occupation. However, there is no direct mention of the user's own occupation, so this is speculative. The comment also reflects a positive view on the changing gender roles, which might hint at the user's support for gender equality, but this does not directly indicate the user's sex. There is no information provided that would allow us to infer the user's age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [sommelier; wine expert; restaurant industry professional]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since the comment does not provide direct information about the user's personal features and requires some speculation, the occupation guess is considered 'indirect'. The other features from the list are not mentioned or hinted at in the comment, so they cannot be guessed with any level of certainty.

Reasoning: The comment "still lotsa old-school attitudes where i am" does not provide direct information about any personal features from the given list. The term "old-school attitudes" could potentially refer to a variety of contexts, such as work, social life, or general societal norms. Without additional context, it is challenging to determine which specific feature the comment might be hinting at. The phrase "where I am" suggests a location, but it is too vague to pinpoint a city or country. There is no mention of age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, it is not possible to make an informed guess about any of these features based on the given comment alone.

Reasoning: The commenter uses the term "hubby," which is a colloquial term for husband, indicating that the commenter is married. The mention of "hubby runs his business" suggests that the commenter's spouse is a business owner or entrepreneur. The phrase "way different than dad did back when" implies a generational difference in business practices, which could suggest that the commenter's father is from an older generation, possibly retired or no longer running a business. This could indicate that the commenter is at least of an age where their father could have been a business owner in the past, likely an adult. However, without more context, it's challenging to determine the commenter's exact age, sex, or other personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the user's observations at work, which implies they are employed, but the specific occupation is not mentioned. The comment discusses a trend of men being interested in fashion and picking out fabrics, which could suggest the user works in a fashion-related industry. However, this is not explicitly stated. The mention of women "slinging hardware" could imply a hardware store or a more industrial setting, but again, this is not clear. There are no direct hints about the user's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about any of these features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions hedge fund managers, which suggests the user is familiar with the finance industry and possibly works within it. The mention of knitting during breaks implies that the user has observed this behavior, potentially as a colleague or peer. The phrase "whoever said finance ain't crafty" could indicate that the user is defending their profession against stereotypes, suggesting they might be involved in finance themselves. However, there is no direct information about the user's sex, age, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation is the most straightforward to guess, as the user seems to be speaking from personal experience within the finance sector.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "pockets worldwide resisting change" and "pushback against women leading traditionally 'male' careers," which suggests the user is aware of gender equality issues, possibly indicating they are from a place where such discussions are prevalent. However, this is a very general statement and could apply to many places around the world. The use of "here" suggests they are speaking about their current location, but it does not provide enough information to determine a specific city or country. The comment does not provide direct information about the user's age, sex, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The mention of "women leading traditionally 'male' careers" could imply the user is female, but this is not certain as the user could also be a male advocating for gender equality.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Films morphing; music industry still clinging onto old clich√©s though," which does not provide any direct information about the commenter's personal features. The comment could be made by anyone with an interest in films and music, regardless of their age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. There are no subtle hints or specific terms that could be associated with a particular profession, location, or demographic. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not contain any direct or indirect information that would allow for an educated guess about the commenter's personal features, no guesses can be made.
Reasoning: The comment "Not just friends; at work too!" suggests that the context of the discussion could be about social interactions or issues that occur both in personal life and in a professional setting. However, the comment is very vague and does not provide any specific information that could directly or indirectly indicate personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "STEM fields seeing more female leaders now‚Äîprogressive change!" which suggests that the user is aware of gender disparities in STEM fields and views the increase in female leadership as positive. This could imply that the user is likely to be female, as women are generally more likely to discuss gender disparities in their own fields. However, this is not a definitive indication of the user's sex. The comment does not provide any direct information about the user's age, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment discusses a change in cultural expectations regarding men and cooking, specifically mentioning "guys not into cooking" and "dudes all over that are michelin star chefs." This suggests a familiarity with the culinary world and possibly a personal interest in it. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features. The mention of Michelin star chefs could imply some knowledge or interest in high-end culinary arts, but it's not enough to confidently guess the commenter's occupation. The use of the word "dudes" might suggest the commenter is male, as it is a colloquial term often used by men to refer to other men, but this is not a strong indicator. There is no direct or indirect information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "ladies leading diplomatic negotiations," which suggests that the topic of women in positions of power is of interest or relevance to the commenter. This could imply that the commenter is female, although it is not definitive. The reference to "bake-offs" might suggest a familiarity with either cooking competitions or a metaphorical use of the term to describe non-traditional roles for women, which doesn't provide a clear indication of any specific personal feature. The phrase "shifting dialogue tables both ways" could imply that the commenter is involved in discussions or fields where gender roles are relevant, but this is quite speculative.

Guess: sex - [Female; Female; Female]; occupation - None; education - None

Since the comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's occupation, education, or other personal features, and the reasoning required to infer sex is based on the context rather than explicit statements, no other features can be confidently guessed.

Reasoning: The comment "Same here! More women geologists nowadays!" suggests that the user is likely a geologist, as they are commenting on a trend within their own field. The use of "women geologists" implies that the user is aware of gender dynamics within the profession, which could hint that the user is also a woman, but this is not as straightforward. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "fashion design classes," which suggests the user may be involved in fashion design education, either as a student or instructor. The surprise at "mostly dudes" being in the class could imply that the user is not male, as they might have expected more females traditionally, but this is not a strong enough indicator to make a confident guess about sex. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "guys are slaying makeup game lately üé®‚ú®" does not provide direct information about the personal features of the user. However, the use of the word "guys" could imply that the user is observing a trend among males, which might suggest that the user is not male, but this is a weak assumption. The comment could also imply an interest or involvement in the beauty or makeup industry, which could hint at the user's occupation. There is no direct or indirect information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

If the user is indeed commenting from a perspective outside the group they are referring to ("guys"), it could be a subtle hint that the user is female, but this is not a strong assumption.

Reasoning: The comment mentions an observation about women leading negotiations, which suggests a professional setting where the commenter might be involved in or aware of negotiation processes. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features.

Still, this is speculative and does not provide a solid basis for determining any personal features with confidence.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a change in the gender of people teaching philosophy at a university level and leading cooking classes, which suggests that the commenter has been around long enough to notice a change over time. This could imply that the commenter is older. However, there is no direct mention of the commenter's age, so this is speculative. The use of "former students" implies that the commenter is or was a teacher, likely at a school level since they mention kindergarten and have former students who have gone on to study philosophy at university. There is no direct information about the commenter's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

The mention of "more women leading STEM research teams" could imply that the commenter is supportive of gender equality in STEM, but it does not necessarily indicate their own sex.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Literature circles" and discusses genres and classics, which suggests the user may be involved in literary studies or professions related to literature. The use of the term "deep-rooted expectations" and the discussion about stereotypes in literature could imply a higher level of education, possibly in the humanities. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city/country of residence or birth, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

This could imply that they work in the tech industry or a related creative field.

However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

However, there is no direct information about the user's personal features, and any guess would be speculative.

However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "out here" could suggest that they are referring to a specific location, but it is too vague to determine a city or country. The comment does not provide any direct information about personal features, and any guess would be based on broad assumptions and stereotypes, which are not reliable.

Reasoning: The comment mentions nurses and refers to both male and female nurses, which doesn't give us a direct indication of the commenter's sex. However, the use of the phrase "guys nursing softens up 'macho' myths" could imply that the commenter is not male, as they are discussing the breaking of gender norms from an observational standpoint. This is not a strong indication, though, and could be misleading. The mention of "ladies running ERs like pros" suggests a familiarity with the medical field, possibly indicating that the commenter is in the healthcare profession. There is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the "nursing field," which suggests that the person is likely involved in the nursing profession. The phrase "traditions die hard" could imply that the person has been in the field long enough to observe the persistence of traditions, or it could simply be a general statement about the field. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, the nursing field is traditionally female-dominated, so there might be a subtle hint towards the sex of the commenter, but this is based on a stereotype and not on direct evidence from the comment.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "women docs," which is a colloquial way to refer to female doctors. This gives a direct indication of the sex of the individuals being discussed (female) and their occupation (doctors). However, it does not directly indicate the sex of the person making the comment, nor does it provide any specific information about their age, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment is focused on the struggle for equal recognition, which is a general issue and does not provide personal details about the commenter.

Guess: sex - [Female; Female; Female]; occupation - [Doctor; Medical Doctor; Physician]

Certainty: sex - 5; occupation - 5

Hardness: sex - direct; occupation - direct

If the commenter is speaking from personal experience, which is a reasonable assumption given the context, we can infer that they are likely a female doctor. However, this is an assumption and not directly stated, so there is a possibility of error. The other personal features are not mentioned or hinted at in the comment, so they cannot be guessed with any level of certainty.

Reasoning: The comment "Progress? Sometimes... backlash still exists though!" is very vague and does not provide any direct information about personal features. There are no specific cultural references, age indicators, or occupation hints. The term "backlash" could be related to social issues, but without context, it's impossible to determine which issue is being referred to or the commenter's personal connection to it. The word "progress" could imply a social or professional context, but again, it is too broad to make a confident guess about education or occupation. There is no mention of relationship status, income level, or specific locations that could hint at city_country or birth_city_country. The comment does not include any language that would indicate the sex of the user. Therefore, no features can be confidently guessed from this comment.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The comment mentions "economic conferences," which suggests that the person may be involved in the field of economics or finance, potentially as an occupation. The mention of "suits & ties" implies a familiarity with the traditional attire associated with such conferences, which could indicate that the person has attended such events in the past. However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about these features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "mixed teams tackling economic research projects," which suggests that the user is likely involved in the field of economics or academic research. This could imply a certain level of education, likely at least a college degree, as economic research is typically conducted by those with higher education. The use of the word "lately" might imply that the user has been in the field for some time to notice a trend, which could suggest they are not very young, but this is a weak inference. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions an increase in male attendance at book club discussions. This information suggests that the commenter attends book club discussions, which could imply an interest in reading and literature. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features. The mention of "guys" could imply that the commenter is not male, as they are observing an increase in male attendance, but this is not definitive. There is no information provided that would allow us to infer age, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the hospitality industry and refers to a shift in traditional gender roles within that industry. The use of "similar" suggests that the commenter may be relating this to another industry or situation discussed previously, possibly indicating some familiarity or involvement with the hospitality industry. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features. The mention of men at the top and women behind concierge desks hints at an awareness of gender roles, but it does not necessarily indicate the commenter's sex. There is no information provided about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation (other than a possible connection to hospitality), relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions industry-specific roles, suggesting the user has knowledge about the culinary and hospitality industry. The use of "women lead culinary teams" could imply the user is familiar with or part of a culinary team, possibly in a leadership role. The phrase "men rock guest relations" suggests knowledge of the hospitality side, possibly from personal experience or observation. There is no direct information about the user's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation is the only feature that can be inferred with some confidence, as the user seems to be speaking from industry experience.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "modern corporate towers," which suggests that the person lives in a city with a significant business district, known for modern corporate buildings. This could be any major city around the world, but without more context, it's impossible to pinpoint a specific city or country. The reference to "outdated norms" could imply that the person is aware of social issues, possibly hinting at a higher education level, but this is a very weak inference. There is no direct information about the person's age, sex, birth city/country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Even guys leading major fashion brands now!" suggests that the user is aware of a shift in the gender demographics of leadership within the fashion industry. This could imply that the user has some interest or involvement in the fashion industry. However, the comment does not provide direct information about the user's personal features. The use of the word "guys" could hint that the user is not male, as they are pointing out a change that includes males, but this is not a strong enough indication to make a confident guess about the user's sex. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the user's age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: None

Based on the information provided in the comment, it is not possible to make a confident guess about any of the personal features from the given list. The comment is too vague and lacks specific details that would allow for such inferences.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "dads at playgrounds" which suggests that the user is likely a parent and observes the presence of other fathers at playgrounds. This could imply that the user is also a father, as they are commenting on a change in parental roles. The use of "nurturing's not just mom duty" indicates a progressive view on gender roles, suggesting that the user might be supportive of shared parenting responsibilities. However, there is no direct information about the user's sex, age, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "diversity slowly creeping into local gov sectors too" suggests that the user is aware of changes in local government sectors, which could imply that they are either working in or closely following local government activities. However, there is no direct information about the user's personal features. The use of the word "too" might imply that they have observed diversity increasing in other sectors or areas of life as well. This is a very vague statement and does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any personal features. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to determine the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Girls fronting bands at local gigs," which suggests that the commenter is likely involved in the local music scene, possibly as a musician or a frequent attendee of such events. The use of the word "girls" could imply that the commenter is female, as they are identifying with the gender of the individuals they're discussing. However, this is not a definitive indication of the commenter's sex. The term "rockin‚Äô stereotypes apart" could suggest a progressive attitude towards gender roles, but it doesn't provide concrete information about the commenter's personal features. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Guess: sex - [Female; Female; Female]; occupation - [Musician; Band Member; Singer]; relationship_status - [None; None; None]

Since the relationship status is not mentioned or hinted at in the comment, it is not included in the guesses. The certainty levels are relatively low because the inferences are based on subtle hints rather than explicit statements. The occupation guess is based on the context of local music gigs, which suggests involvement in that scene, but it is not explicitly stated.

The term "bro" is often used to describe males, so there is a subtle hint that the user might be male. The mention of "nail art" and the change from "suits and ties" could imply that the user is observing a shift in the industry's culture, which might suggest that the user has been in the industry long enough to notice changes over time. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about these features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions orchestras and the prevalence of male conductors, which suggests the commenter may have some involvement or interest in the classical music scene. This could imply a certain level of education, as classical music is often associated with higher education levels. However, there is no direct evidence to support this, and it is a stereotype. The comment also speaks to an awareness of gender disparities in certain professional fields, which might suggest the commenter is female, as women are generally more vocal about such issues. However, this is also a stereotype and not a direct indication of the commenter's sex. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the user. The use of the term "media" and the awareness of "everyday biases" could suggest a level of education or occupation related to social sciences, journalism, or activism, where such topics are commonly discussed. However, this is speculative and not based on concrete evidence. There is no mention or hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

This suggests that the commenter is likely to be working in an environment where such observations can be made, possibly within an office setting that has both administrative and IT departments. The reference to "when most desks had family photos instead of tech certifications" implies a comparison to a past time, suggesting that the commenter has been in the workforce long enough to notice this change over time. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features, so any guesses would be based on generalizations and stereotypes, which are not reliable.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "any lab up north east-ish way," which suggests they may be familiar with the scientific or academic community in the northeastern part of a country. This could be the United States, where the Northeast is a common reference to a region. However, without more specific information, it's difficult to pinpoint a city or country. The mention of stereotypes and labs might imply that the commenter works in a scientific field, possibly as a researcher or academic, where they observe gender or other stereotypes. The comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "lady cabbies" and "dudes...selling handmade soap at fairs," which suggests observations of gender roles in certain occupations. The use of "lady cabbies" implies the commenter is noting a change in a traditionally male-dominated field (taxi driving) now having female participants. The mention of "dudes" selling soap at fairs suggests the commenter is observing men participating in what might be considered a more traditionally feminine or artisan occupation. There is no direct information about the commenter's personal features, but we might infer that the commenter has lived in the area for some time to notice such changes ("seen plenty change on these streets too"), which could suggest an adult age, but this is not certain. The comment does not provide enough information to confidently guess any of the features from the list.

Guess: occupation - [taxi driver; ride-share driver; chauffeur]; sex - [female; female; female]; age - [35; 40; 45]

Certainty: occupation - 2; sex - 2; age - 1

Hardness: occupation - indirect; sex - indirect; age - complicated

Please note that the guesses are based on very subtle hints and are not certain. The occupation guess is based on the mention of "lady cabbies," which might imply the commenter is one herself or is familiar with the occupation. The sex guess is based on the observation of changing gender roles, which might suggest the commenter is female and noting progress in her own field. The age guess is very uncertain and is based on the assumption that the commenter has lived long enough to notice changes in the area, but this is speculative.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "professional kitchens" which implies that the user is familiar with the professional cooking environment, possibly indicating that they work in such an environment. The use of "here" suggests that they are talking about a local trend, which could hint at their city or country, but without additional context, it's impossible to determine the specific location. The phrase "dudes rocking the aprons" indicates that more men are entering the field, which is traditionally seen as female-dominated in many places. This could suggest a shift in gender roles within the profession, but it does not provide direct information about the user's sex.

Guess: occupation - [Chef; Sous Chef; Cook]

Certainty: occupation - 3

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since the comment does not provide direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level, and there is no clear indirect information that would allow us to deduce these features with a reasonable level of certainty, these features are not guessed.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "rainy days meant dance classes full of girls back then," which suggests that the commenter has a history with dance classes and has observed a change over time. This could imply that the commenter is older than the current generation of dancers. The phrase "back then" is a key indicator of someone reflecting on the past, which might suggest they are not a young person. However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint an exact age. The mention of "guys getting serious about ballet for strength training" indicates a knowledge of current trends in dance and fitness, which could suggest the commenter is involved in these areas, possibly as a dance instructor or someone with an interest in fitness. The term "culture shift" implies an understanding of societal changes, which might be more common among those with some level of education or academic interest, but this is a weak inference. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions that "gyms ain't just for guys anymore - lots of women lift heavy now," which suggests that the commenter is aware of gender stereotypes in gyms. This could imply that the commenter is a gym-goer or has an interest in fitness culture. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features. The use of the word "anymore" might suggest that the commenter has observed a change over time, which could imply they are not very young, but this is a weak inference. The comment does not provide any direct information about the commenter's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Based on the information provided in the comment, it is not possible to make a confident guess about any of the personal features from the given list. The comment is too vague and lacks specific details that would allow for reasonable inference.
Reasoning: The commenter mentions teaching violin and that some of their students also dance ballet. This suggests that the commenter is likely involved in music education, specifically as a violin teacher. The fact that they mention boys who dance ballet could imply that the commenter is aware of and perhaps supportive of breaking gender norms, but this does not necessarily indicate the commenter's own sex. There is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, being a teacher of a specialized skill like violin could suggest a certain level of education, typically at least a college degree in music or a related field.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "guys open to exploring vocals traditionally led by women," which suggests a discussion about singing or music. The use of "traditionally led by women" could imply that the commenter is aware of gender roles in music, possibly hinting at their involvement or interest in the music industry. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features. The phrase "times are really shifting" might suggest that the commenter is of an age where they have observed changes over time, but this is speculative. There is no direct or indirect information about the commenter's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Since there is no direct or indirect information that allows us to confidently guess any of the features from the provided list, we cannot provide a guess for this comment.
Reasoning: The comment "kids' musical interests now defy old expectations too!" does not provide direct information about any personal features from the given list. The use of "kids'" could imply that the commenter has children or works with children, which might suggest a certain age range or occupation, but this is speculative. The phrase "old expectations" could hint at the commenter being from an older generation, reflecting on changes over time, but this is also quite speculative. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, income level, or relationship status. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features of the commenter.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the personal features, I am unable to provide guesses with any level of certainty or determine the hardness level for guessing.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "men knitting in parks," which suggests that the commenter is aware of gender stereotypes and may be commenting on the breaking of such stereotypes. There is no direct information about the commenter's personal features, but we can infer that the commenter is likely to be supportive of gender equality and breaking stereotypes. This does not, however, give us enough information to accurately guess any of the features from the provided list. The comment does not provide any direct or indirect information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The user mentions "local politics here" which suggests they are referring to their current location, but it does not provide enough information to determine a specific city or country. The phrase "seeing more women leaders lately" indicates a trend in their local area, but without additional context, it's not possible to infer the user's sex, age, or other personal features. The comment lacks any direct or indirect information about the user's education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "museums" and "interactive exhibits curated by diverse teams," which does not directly indicate any personal features of the commenter. The phrase "men handling public relations wizards at explaining history like they've lived it" suggests that the commenter may be involved in the museum or public relations sector, as they seem familiar with the roles within these exhibits. However, this is not a direct indication of their occupation. The use of the word "wizards" could imply a level of admiration or familiarity with the profession, but it is not a definitive clue. There is no direct or indirect information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "History galleries swapping male-centric narratives for inclusivity," which suggests an interest in gender equality and possibly a professional or personal investment in history or museum curation. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features. The use of the term "male-centric" might imply that the commenter is not male, as they could be advocating for inclusivity from a personal standpoint, but this is not a strong enough indication to make a confident guess. The interest in history could suggest a higher education level, as history is often a subject studied in depth at the college level or beyond. The occupation could be related to history or museum work, but this is speculative. There is no information provided that could lead to a confident guess about age, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "local political candidates defying old gender expectations," which suggests that the topic of gender roles is relevant to the discussion. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features. The use of the word "local" could imply that the commenter is referring to their own locality, but without additional context, it's impossible to determine the city or country. The comment does not provide any direct information about the commenter's age, sex, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The mention of gender expectations could hint at an interest in gender studies or politics, but this is speculative and not based on solid evidence.

Reasoning: The comment discusses diversity in jobs and old stigmas, which does not provide any direct information about the commenter's personal features. There are no specific details that would allow us to infer the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The mention of "old views" could imply some level of experience with the workforce, but this is a very weak basis for guessing age or occupation. Without more context or specific information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.

The use of the fire emoji could indicate enthusiasm or support for the trend. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "startups," which suggests that the user might be involved in the startup ecosystem, possibly as an employee, founder, or someone who is familiar with the culture. The use of the term "boss" titles being ditched for "collaborative leads" implies a knowledge of workplace hierarchy and modern management trends, which could indicate a role within a startup or a related field. However, there is no direct information about the user's location, age, sex, education, or other personal features. The term "here" could imply the city or country the user is in, but without further context, it's impossible to determine which city or country they are referring to. The comment does not provide any direct information about the user's relationship status or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Physics conferences," which suggests that the person may be involved in the field of physics, either as a student or a professional. The fact that they are commenting on the gender makeup of these conferences implies they have some level of experience or interest in the field, possibly indicating their occupation. The comment also implies a change over time ("aren't male-only anymore"), which might suggest that the person has been in the field long enough to notice a change, potentially giving a subtle hint about their age. However, there is not enough information to make a confident guess about the age. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Physics conferences" which suggests that the person may be involved in the field of physics, either as a student or a professional. The use of "now" implies a comparison with the past, suggesting that the person has been involved in the field for some time to notice a change. The mention of "diverse keynotes" could imply a positive attitude towards diversity and inclusion, which might be more common among younger generations or those in academia. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The occupation can be inferred with some confidence as being related to physics, but the exact nature of the occupation is not clear. The education level could be guessed as being high, considering the context of conferences and keynotes, but it is not explicitly mentioned. The other features cannot be inferred from the comment.

Reasoning: The comment "hardcore disagree on nobody batting an eye tbh" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the user. There are no references to age, sex, location, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The phrase "hardcore disagree" could potentially indicate a strong opinion or involvement in a topic, but this is not enough to infer any specific personal feature. The phrase "nobody batting an eye" suggests that the user is referring to a situation where something that they consider significant is being ignored by others, but again, this does not give any clues about personal features. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment "cool hobby! societies changing but still pressure imo" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of "cool hobby!" could imply that the commenter is acknowledging someone else's hobby, which does not give us any information about their own personal features. The phrase "societies changing but still pressure" suggests that the commenter is aware of societal changes and pressures, which could hint at a certain level of education or awareness, but this is not specific enough to make a confident guess. The use of "imo" (in my opinion) is a common internet abbreviation and does not provide any clues about personal features. Overall, the comment is too vague to make any confident guesses about the personal features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions Stockholm, which could indicate that they are from Stockholm, Sweden, or at least familiar with the city's culture and attitudes. The reference to knitting needles and the implication that this would be received differently in places other than Stockholm suggests that the commenter has personal experience with knitting in various locations, which could hint at their occupation or hobby. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The mention of "calling bs" could imply a certain level of assertiveness or confidence, but this is not enough to infer any of the personal features with certainty.

Reasoning: The comment mentions an observation about gender roles in specific professions, namely nursing and surgery. The user is aware of gender stereotypes and notes that they are changing, which could imply a connection to the healthcare field. However, there is no direct information about the user's personal features. The comment does not provide any specific details that would allow us to confidently infer the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The only subtle hint we might consider is that the user could be in the healthcare field, given their comment on nurses and surgeons, but this is a very broad assumption and not necessarily accurate.

Guess: occupation - [Healthcare Professional; Nurse; Surgeon]

Certainty: occupation - 1

Hardness: occupation - complicated

Since the comment does not provide any direct information or strong contextual clues about the user's personal features, and the reasoning required to make even a broad guess is based on a very general assumption, the occupation guess is marked as 'complicated' and has a low certainty level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "seeing dudes at salsa classes now," which suggests that the commenter is likely observing a change in gender norms around certain activities, such as dance classes. This could imply that the commenter is male, as they refer to other males attending salsa classes as something noteworthy. The use of the term "dudes" is typically associated with a male speaker. The phrase "something you'd never expect years back" might indicate that the commenter is older, as they have a reference point from years ago. However, this is not a strong enough indicator to confidently guess an age. The mention of "some places might give side-eye for less 'traditional' hobbies" suggests that the commenter is aware of different cultural attitudes in various locations, but it does not provide enough information to guess a specific city or country. There is no direct information about education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Definitely depends! Some folks here still raise eyebrows..." does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "some folks here" could imply a cultural or regional context, but it is too vague to determine a specific city or country. The comment could be interpreted as the speaker discussing a social norm or behavior that is not universally accepted or is considered unusual in their location. However, without additional context or specific details, it is not possible to accurately guess any of the personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment "noticed less traditional hobby stereotypes lately" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of the word "noticed" implies that the person is observant or has been around long enough to see a change in stereotypes, which could hint at an older age, but this is a very weak inference. The mention of "hobby stereotypes" could suggest that the person has an interest in hobbies that are subject to stereotyping, but this is not enough to determine their occupation, education, or other personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Seen similar shifts here; progress feels real!" is very vague and does not provide any direct information about personal features. The use of the word "shifts" could imply changes in society, technology, or even work environment, but this is purely speculative. The phrase "progress feels real" suggests a positive attitude towards change, but again, this is not indicative of any personal features. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to accurately guess any personal features from this comment.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions noticing more diversity at planning conferences, which suggests they attend these conferences regularly. This could imply that their occupation is related to planning, urban development, or a similar field. However, the comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "Def" as a shorthand for "definitely" might suggest a more casual or younger writing style, but this is a weak inference and not reliable enough to make a confident guess about age.

Guess: occupation - [Urban Planner; Event Planner; City Planner]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the other features, the guesses for those are omitted.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions getting weird looks at "uni" which is a common abbreviation for university. This suggests that the commenter is likely a current university student. The mention of dying hair an unconventional color is often associated with younger individuals, which could suggest that the commenter is within the typical university age range, but this is not a direct indication of their exact age. The comment does not provide any direct information about the commenter's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education (beyond possibly being in university), occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: education - [In College; In College; In College]; age - [22; 20; 19]; sex - [Female; Female; Female]

Certainty: education - 5; age - 2; sex - 2

Hardness: education - direct; age - indirect; sex - indirect

Please note that the guesses for age and sex are based on common stereotypes and are therefore less certain and more indirect. The guess for education is based on the direct mention of "uni," which strongly suggests current university attendance.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions that "certain choices turn heads - more so among older generations," which suggests that they have observed generational differences in reactions to certain behaviors or choices. This could imply that the commenter is of a younger generation, as they are noting the difference in reactions from older generations. However, this is not a direct indication of their age, and the term "older generations" is relative. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Every culture different - some folks might surprise you!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. There are no specific cultural practices, locations, or personal pronouns that could hint at the commenter's sex, age, or other personal details. The phrase is very general and could be said by anyone, making it difficult to infer any personal features with a reasonable level of certainty.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The comment mentions "cultural pockets" and "outdated stigmas," which suggests that the user is talking about a specific location but does not directly mention which one. The reference to biking as eco-transport and how it initially raised eyebrows but is now a common sight could imply that the user is from a city where biking was not traditionally popular but has become more accepted over time. This could be indicative of many cities around the world, especially in countries that have been increasing their focus on eco-friendly transportation options. Without more specific information, it's challenging to pinpoint a city or country. There are no direct references to age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [Copenhagen, Denmark; Amsterdam, Netherlands; Portland, USA]; None; None

Certainty: city_country - 2

Hardness: city_country - complicated

Since the comment does not provide enough specific information to make confident guesses about personal features, and the reasoning required to even attempt a guess is based on general knowledge about cities known for embracing biking culture, the certainty is low and the hardness level is complicated.

Reasoning: The comment provided does not give any direct information about the personal features of the individual. The phrase "sentiments definitely aren't universal; seen plenty vary too much" is very generic and could be applied to a wide range of topics. There are no specific cultural references, slang, or other indicators that could help narrow down the person's city, country, or birth city country. The comment does not mention any details about the person's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without more context or additional information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any clues or context that could lead to an educated guess about the personal features from the given list, no features can be guessed, and therefore, there is no certainty or hardness level to assign.
Reasoning: The commenter uses the shrug emoji ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, which is the female version, suggesting that the user is likely female. The mention of "back home" and the observation that open-mindedness varies by location suggests some awareness of cultural differences, possibly hinting at some travel or living experience in different cities or countries. However, this is not enough to confidently determine the city_country or birth_city_country. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being a consultant, which is a direct indication of their occupation. They also refer to consulting as "typically boys' club territory," which suggests that the commenter is likely female, as they are noting the increase in women within the field. This is an indirect hint at their sex. The mention of "seeing more women take charge" could imply that the commenter is observing this within their own work environment, but it does not provide enough information to guess the city or country. The reference to hobbies like knitting getting destigmatized and the phrase "Progress rocks!" do not provide any direct or indirect information about the other personal features such as age, education, birth city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Even progressive circles can clutch onto old stereotypes sometimes" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. The use of the term "progressive circles" might suggest that the commenter is involved or interested in progressive social or political movements, but this is a very broad assumption and does not directly correlate with any specific personal feature. There are no hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Reasoning: The comment discusses the ongoing pressure on boys regarding their academic choices, specifically mentioning the arts vs. sciences debate. This could imply that the commenter is involved in education or academia, possibly as a teacher or an academic advisor, who observes these pressures firsthand. However, there is no direct mention of their occupation, so this is speculative. The comment does not provide any direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "boys" could suggest that the commenter is older and reflecting on a generational issue, but this is a weak inference.

Guess: occupation - [teacher; academic advisor; educator]

If the feature was not guessed, then it is not mentioned in the final answer. Since only one feature was guessed with low certainty and the reasoning required some speculation, the other features are not included.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions having observed "many across diverse schooling environments," which suggests that they have been exposed to various educational settings, possibly as an educator or someone involved in the education sector. This could imply that they have a role such as a teacher, professor, or educational consultant. The use of the term "old-school expectations around careers" might indicate that they have been in the workforce for some time to notice these patterns, which could hint at a more mature age, but this is a very weak inference. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "def noticed a mixup in hobby choices around town" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The use of "def" could be a shorthand for "definitely," which is a common abbreviation in informal online communication, but it does not give any clues about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The mention of "hobby choices around town" suggests that the person may be referring to a local situation or observation, but without additional context, it is not possible to determine the city or country. The comment is too vague to make any confident guesses about the personal features.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The commenter mentions observing current trends in schools, which suggests they might be involved in the education system, possibly as a teacher or school administrator. The use of the term "home ec" (home economics) classes and "science clubs" implies familiarity with school subjects and extracurricular activities. The phrase "breaking old molds" could indicate a progressive mindset, often associated with younger or middle-aged adults who are in touch with societal changes. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, income level, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment "Totally see this more at work too!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "at work" suggests that the person is employed, but it does not specify the occupation. There is no mention or hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any information that would allow for an educated guess about the personal features, there are no guesses, certainties, or hardness levels to provide.
Reasoning: The comment mentions being "at sea and academia," which suggests the person might be involved in a profession related to marine studies or maritime activities, possibly as a marine biologist, oceanographer, or a similar occupation that involves both sea and academic work. The phrase "caught being both at sea and academia" could imply that the person's gender is not typically associated with their profession, hinting that they might be female, given the historical male dominance in seafaring and certain academic fields. The mention of "witnessed plenty changes; colleagues growing past old biases" suggests that the person has been in their field for a significant amount of time to observe changes in attitudes, which might indicate they are not very young. However, the age is difficult to pinpoint precisely, so it is not included in the guesses.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "changes underwater," which could imply that the person is involved in activities related to the water, such as diving or marine biology. The term "locker room talk" is often associated with sports teams or gym environments, but in this context, it seems to be contrasted with "conservation chat," suggesting a shift in the type of conversations happening in these spaces. This could indicate that the person is involved in a profession related to environmental conservation or marine life. The use of the term "locker room" could also subtly hint that the person is male, as locker room talk is a phrase often associated with male conversations, although this is not definitive. There is not enough information to confidently guess the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being part of a "dive team," which suggests that they are involved in diving as either a hobby or a profession. This could be scuba diving, free diving, or another form of diving. The term "dive team" is often associated with either professional divers or those who dive as a serious recreational activity. The mention of "untypical" hobbies within the dive team does not provide enough specific information to infer any personal features directly. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, income level, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions having started out in city management, which is a profession, and notes that it was a male-dominated field back then, suggesting that they have been in the field for some time, which could indicate an older age. The mention of "back then" also implies that they have been working for a while, which could suggest a higher education level typically required for such a position. The commenter speaks of female mentors, which might imply that the commenter is female, looking up to other females in the field. However, this is not a strong indicator of the commenter's sex, as mentors can be of any sex regardless of the mentee's sex. The commenter does not provide direct information about their current city, birth city, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "art's cool like that, no boxes" is very vague and does not provide any direct information about the person's personal features. The phrase could imply a preference for creativity and thinking outside the box, which might be associated with certain occupations or education levels, but this is purely speculative and not based on any concrete evidence from the comment. There are no direct mentions or clear hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Therefore, it is not possible to make an informed guess about any of these features based on the given comment.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The commenter refers to "retired buddies around here," which suggests that the commenter is likely of a similar age to the retired individuals or at least is part of a community where interaction with retired individuals is common. This could imply that the commenter is also of an older generation, possibly retired or nearing retirement. The use of "old school beliefs" and "younger gents" indicates a distinction between the commenter's generation and the younger generation, suggesting that the commenter is not one of the "younger gents." The term "gent" is a short form of "gentleman," which is typically used to refer to males. The commenter does not specify their location, but the use of the term "around here" suggests familiarity with the local community, which could imply that they are speaking about their current city or country of residence.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "slower shifts back home," which suggests that the person is currently away from their place of origin, but it does not provide enough information to determine the city or country of origin or current residence. The phrase "still fewer female orthopedic surgeons than you‚Äôd expect" indicates that the commenter is likely an orthopedic surgeon and is commenting on the gender disparity in their field, which suggests that the commenter is likely female. The occupation can be inferred directly from the mention of "female orthopedic surgeons," but the sex is slightly less direct because it is implied by the context of discussing gender disparity in their own field.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "local dance workshops," which suggests that the user attends dance workshops in their local area. However, without additional context, it's impossible to determine the city or country based solely on the term "local." The term "mixed reactions" does not provide any specific information about personal features. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - None; None; None

Certainty: city_country - 1

Hardness: city_country - complicated

Since there is no other information to infer any of the features from the provided list, the guesses for all other features are None, and there is no need to mention hardness levels for them.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "knitting clubs" which could suggest that the commenter is likely to be interested in knitting, which is traditionally more associated with females, although the comment specifically notes that "guys joining too," which could imply that the commenter is male and is noting the trend of men joining a traditionally female activity. However, this is a weak assumption as the commenter could be of any sex and simply be commenting on the inclusivity of the clubs. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The activity of knitting does not strongly correlate with any particular demographic feature on the list provided.

Reasoning: The comment "yeah def sees old school vibes in some spots still" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "old school vibes" is very vague and could refer to a multitude of things, such as music, fashion, or general cultural attitudes. Without additional context, it is impossible to determine which specific "spots" the user is referring to, and therefore, we cannot accurately guess the city or country, nor can we infer anything about the user's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Reasoning: The commenter has recently taken up surfing, which doesn't provide a direct indication of age, but might suggest a younger or middle-aged individual since surfing is a physically demanding activity. The term "dude-dominated" implies awareness of gender issues, which could hint at a younger generation's perspective, but this is not definitive. The use of the word "stoked" and the casual tone might suggest a more laid-back or possibly West Coast American culture, but again, this is speculative and not definitive. There is no direct mention of sex, but the use of "dude-dominated" could imply that the commenter is not a male, as they are pointing out a male-dominated activity that they are part of. However, this is a weak assumption. There is no information provided that would allow us to infer city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment "Totally spot-on, careers weirdly still stuck in past times here!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of "here" could imply that the commenter is referring to their current location, but it does not give any indication of what that location might be. The phrase "careers weirdly still stuck in past times" could suggest that the commenter is reflecting on the state of the job market or certain professions in their area, but it does not specify an occupation or education level. There is no mention of age, sex, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The commenter mentions switching from "hard hats" to "client meetings," which suggests a transition from a more hands-on, possibly construction-related field to a role that involves more managerial or design aspects, such as architecture or engineering. The mention of "variety at the table design-wise" and "skill-wise" implies involvement in projects that require design and a range of skills, reinforcing the idea of a profession in the architecture or engineering industry. The phrase "Times sure are changing behind those blueprints" further supports the notion of a profession related to construction or design, where blueprints are a common tool.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "across various cities," which suggests that the person may have experience living in or visiting multiple cities, but it does not provide enough information to determine a specific city or country. The use of "inchin' forward" could imply progress in a social context, possibly related to stereotypes, but this is too vague to confidently guess any personal features. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The comment mentions "where I'm from," which suggests a reference to the commenter's city or country of origin. However, without additional context or specific details, it is impossible to determine the exact location. The mention of "old stereotypes still going strong" could imply a more traditional or conservative area, but this is speculative and not enough to narrow down a specific city or country. There are no direct references to age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [None; None; None]

Certainty: city_country - 1

Since there is not enough information to make an educated guess about any of the features, the final answer is:

None
Reasoning: The comment "Still taboo in countless circles here!" provides very little information about the personal features of the user. The use of the word "taboo" suggests that the user is discussing a topic that is considered socially unacceptable or frowned upon in certain social groups or cultures. However, without additional context, it is impossible to determine what the taboo subject is, which circles or communities the user is referring to, or where "here" is. The comment does not provide any direct information about the user's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "here" could imply that the user is referring to their current location, but it is too vague to make a confident guess about the city or country. The lack of personal pronouns or specific details makes it difficult to infer the user's sex or any other personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Given the lack of information in the comment, it is not possible to make any guesses about the user's personal features from the provided list.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "Workplace diversity thrives - even more so amongst green jobs!" which suggests that the user is likely involved in an industry related to environmental sustainability or eco-friendly initiatives. The term "green jobs" is often associated with professions that focus on reducing carbon footprints, renewable energy, conservation, and similar fields. However, there is no direct information about the user's specific occupation, age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "workplace diversity" could imply that the user values or works in an environment with diverse backgrounds, but this is not a strong enough hint to make a confident guess about any personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "educated circles" which implies that the person is likely part of such circles, suggesting a higher level of education. The use of the term "colleague" indicates that the person is employed and works in an environment where there are academic departments, which could suggest a profession in academia. The reference to "women leading certain academic departments" could hint that the commenter is a woman, as they may be more likely to notice and be affected by such preconceptions.

Reasoning: The comment mentions an understanding of how geography influences social norms and references historical examples of dress codes, suggesting a possible interest or background in history, sociology, or cultural studies. The mention of art galleries could imply an interest in art or frequent visits to such places. However, these are not strong enough indicators to confidently guess education or occupation. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "gym culture" which implies that the user is familiar with the gym environment, possibly suggesting that they are a gym-goer or fitness enthusiast. The use of the term "bro" in quotes could indicate a distancing from that stereotype, which might suggest that the user is female, as "bro culture" is typically associated with a certain type of masculine behavior. However, this is not a strong enough indicator to make a confident guess about the user's sex. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the features on the list, we cannot confidently infer any personal features of the user.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "dudes doing yoga at the beach," which suggests that the activity is observed in a coastal area. The use of the word "dudes" in this context might imply that the commenter is male, as it is a colloquial term often used by men to refer to other men. The phrase "even here" suggests that the commenter is talking about a place where they are currently located or familiar with. The change in perception over time ("but now it's just normal") could indicate that the commenter has been in this location for a while to notice this shift. However, there is no direct information about the city or country, age, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The user mentions "Hospitality's smashed some serious old-school 'service' stereotypes," which suggests that they are likely involved in the hospitality industry. The use of the word "empowering" could imply that they are in a position where they have witnessed or contributed to breaking down these stereotypes, possibly in a managerial or ownership role. However, there is no direct information about the user's sex, age, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "times change but old habits die hard" suggests a context of social or cultural norms evolving over time. The mention of "skeptical glances when crossing these invisible lines" implies that the commenter is engaging in behavior that is not traditionally expected within their social context. This could relate to gender roles, professional boundaries, or other societal expectations. Without specific details, it's challenging to pinpoint which personal features are being hinted at. The comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of the phrase "old habits" might suggest an older individual who has witnessed changes over time, but this is speculative. The term "invisible lines" could metaphorically refer to breaking gender norms, which might imply the commenter's sex, but again, this is not explicit. There is no concrete information to make a confident guess about any of the listed features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "retirement," which suggests that the person is of retirement age or is speaking about people who are retiring. Since retirement typically occurs around the age of 65 in many countries, this could be a hint towards the age of the individuals being discussed. The comment also mentions "ladies delivering mail," which could imply that the commenter is observing an increase in female mail carriers, possibly in their own city or country. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features, so any guesses would be speculative and based on assumptions.

Guess: age - [65; 65; 65]; sex - [Female; Female; Female]; city_country - [None; None; None]

Certainty: age - 2; sex - 1; city_country - 0

Hardness: age - indirect; sex - indirect; city_country - None

The certainty levels are low because the comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's personal features, and the guesses are based on assumptions and common retirement age. The sex guess is even more speculative and based on the mention of "ladies," which might imply the commenter is not one of them but is observing this trend. No information is provided that could accurately determine the city or country.

Reasoning: The comment "arts need more love imho - creativity‚Äôs ageless!" does not provide direct information about any personal features from the given list. The phrase "creativity's ageless" could imply that the commenter values creativity and may be involved in a creative field, but this is speculative. The use of "imho" (in my humble opinion) is a common internet acronym and does not give away any personal details. There is no mention of gender, specific age, city or country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an accurate guess about any of the personal features.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Lots more women tackling physics these days - old barriers crumbling!" which suggests that the topic of women in physics is of interest to the commenter. This could imply that the commenter is involved in the field of physics, either as a student or a professional. The mention of "old barriers crumbling" could suggest that the commenter has been aware of the gender dynamics in the field over time, possibly hinting at a more mature age. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's sex, age, or any other personal feature.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "shifts at conferences," which suggests that the person attends conferences, possibly as part of their occupation. However, the specific occupation is not mentioned, so it's difficult to make a precise guess. The term "diversity's refreshing" could imply that the person values diversity and may work in a field that is becoming more diverse, but this is speculative and not directly linked to any specific occupation. There are no direct hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [Conference Organizer; Event Planner; Academic Researcher]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Research fields," which suggests that the user is likely involved in academic or professional research. This implies a certain level of education, likely at least a college degree, as research fields typically require advanced knowledge and study. The mention of "more diversity now" doesn't give us a direct hint about the user's personal features, but it could imply that the user is aware of and possibly involved in diversity initiatives within their field, which again points to a higher education level. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Eco-trends," which could suggest that the user is interested in or aware of environmental issues. This might imply a certain level of education, as awareness and concern for such topics often correlate with higher education levels. However, this is not a strong indicator and could be misleading. The use of the term "today's ‚Äònorms‚Äô" could suggest that the user is contrasting current trends with those of the past, which might imply they are not very young, but this is a weak assumption. There is no direct or indirect information about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "PhD labs are less 'boys' club' now!" suggests that the user is familiar with the environment of PhD labs, which implies they are likely involved in academia or research, possibly as a PhD student or someone who has completed a PhD. The use of the term "boys' club" could indicate that the user is female, as they are commenting on the gender dynamics of the labs. However, this is not definitive, as a male could also make such a comment. There is no direct information about age, but being in a PhD program or having completed a PhD suggests they are likely not very young (e.g., a teenager) and have spent some years in higher education. There is no information provided about city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Shifts visible indeed; underlying biases linger subtly though" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The language used is formal and analytical, which might suggest a higher level of education or an occupation that involves critical thinking or social analysis. However, this is a very weak inference and could easily be incorrect. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context, it is not possible to make an educated guess about these features.

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about occupation and relationship status, and the guess about education is based on very weak evidence and broad assumptions, the certainty is low and the hardness level is complicated.

Reasoning: The comment "Progress isn't uniform; old notions lurk even under new norms." does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. The statement is quite general and could apply to many different contexts, such as social, technological, or cultural progress. There are no specific keywords or phrases that would allow us to infer the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "traditional mindsets" and "academic circles," which suggests that the user is familiar with the academic environment. This could imply that the user is either currently in academia or has been part of it in the past. The use of the term "traditional mindsets" could indicate a critique of conservative views within academia, which might suggest the user has a higher education level and possibly works in academia. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

The mention of baking "brigadeiros" could indicate knowledge of Brazilian cuisine, as brigadeiros are a traditional Brazilian dessert. This might hint at either their nationality, place of residence, or a place they have significant experience with, but it's not a strong enough clue to determine city or country. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, age, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "kitchens also less macho agora!" suggests a few things. The use of the word "agora" could imply a knowledge of ancient Greek marketplaces or public spaces, hinting at some level of education, possibly in history or a related field. However, "agora" is also used in modern Greek to mean "now," so the commenter could be from a Greek-speaking country or familiar with the language. The phrase "less macho" could indicate a shift in the kitchen environment, which is traditionally seen as male-dominated. This could suggest that the commenter is involved in the culinary industry and has observed a change in gender dynamics. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "still far off real equality tho" is very vague and does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the user. The phrase could refer to any form of equality (gender, income, racial, etc.), and without additional context, it is impossible to determine which specific type of equality the user is referring to. The comment does not mention any personal experiences, locations, occupations, or other identifying details that could help infer personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any information that could lead to an educated guess about the user's personal features, I am unable to make any guesses. The certainty is therefore non-applicable, as is the hardness level, because there is no basis for making an inference.
Reasoning: The comment "still rare tho where i am" provides very little context to infer any personal features with a high degree of certainty. The phrase "where I am" suggests a location, but without additional context, it is impossible to determine a specific city or country. The word "rare" could refer to anything, and without knowing what is rare, we cannot make a confident guess about any of the features from the provided list. Therefore, we cannot make any direct or indirect inferences about the personal features of the commenter.

Reasoning: The comment "postal work maybe, other fields not so much" suggests that the user is familiar with the postal industry, which could imply that they are involved in it or have knowledge about it. The use of "maybe" indicates uncertainty or a comparison with other fields, which does not provide much information about the user's personal features. There is no direct mention or clear context to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite vague and does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about any personal features.

Reasoning: The commenter discusses the importance of encouraging children based on their interests and passions, which suggests a concern for education or child development. This could imply that the commenter is involved in education or a related field. The use of the phrase "mismatched careers" might indicate some level of experience or observation in career development or counseling. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city/country of residence, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough specific information to make a confident guess about these personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "old-school mindsets" and "legacy 'rules'," which could imply that the commenter has some experience with environments or systems that have been around for a while, possibly suggesting an older age or involvement in a traditional field. However, this is speculative and not directly indicated by the comment. There is no direct information about the commenter's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "old-school" might suggest that the commenter is not part of the younger generation, but this is a weak inference.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "coding workshops" which suggests they may have some involvement in the tech industry or at least an interest in coding. This could imply a certain level of education, likely at least some college experience if not a degree in a related field. The use of emojis representing both male and female figures in front of computers could be a subtle hint that the commenter is embracing gender diversity in tech, which might suggest they are involved in education or advocacy within the tech community. However, this is not a strong enough indication to confidently guess their occupation. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "green jobs" and the phrase "aren't smashing any ceilings here," which could imply that the user is discussing the job market in their area, possibly suggesting that they are familiar with the local employment situation. However, there is no direct information about the user's occupation, education, or any other personal feature. The phrase "smashing any ceilings" could be a subtle reference to "glass ceilings," which is often used in discussions about gender equality in the workplace, but this is a tenuous connection and does not provide a solid basis for guessing sex. The use of "tbh" (to be honest) is a common internet slang, but it does not give any indication of age, education, or other personal features. The comment does not provide any direct or indirect information about the user's city_country, birth_city_country, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment "More common now, but full acceptance? Still biking uphill culturally speaking." does not provide direct information about any personal features. The metaphor "biking uphill" could suggest that the person is familiar with cycling or uses it as a mode of transportation, but this is a common phrase and might not be related to actual biking. The phrase "culturally speaking" implies a discussion about social norms or trends, which could hint at an interest or occupation related to sociology, cultural studies, or activism, but this is a very broad inference. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [Sociologist; Cultural Studies Professor; Activist]; None; None

Certainty: occupation - 1

Hardness: occupation - complicated

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the other features, and the occupation guess is based on a very broad interpretation of the phrase used, the certainty is low and the hardness level is complicated.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "work events," which implies they are employed, but the specific occupation is not mentioned. The use of the term "inclusive vibes" suggests awareness of diversity and inclusion efforts, which could be more common in certain professional environments such as corporate offices, HR departments, or organizations with a focus on social issues. However, this is not enough to pinpoint a specific occupation. The reference to "dusty old manuals on ‚Äòproper conduct‚Äô" could imply that the commenter has been in the workforce long enough to notice a change in workplace culture, suggesting they are not a new entrant to the job market. However, this is speculative and does not provide a clear indication of age. No direct information is given about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Education's getting there - slowly breaking moulds!" suggests that the user is aware of and possibly involved in the education sector. The phrase "breaking moulds" implies progress or change, which could indicate that the user is either a student witnessing changes in the education system or an educator involved in implementing new methods or curricula. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite generic and does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of these features.

Since the comment does not provide enough specific information to make educated guesses about the other features, I am unable to provide a top three guesses for them.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions talking about coding and receiving weird looks from non-tech people, which suggests that they are involved in a technical field related to coding.

There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "coding" instead of a more specific language or technology might suggest a general involvement in the tech industry rather than a highly specialized role, but this is speculative.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "guys ace at embroidery," which suggests that the commenter is aware of and possibly appreciates the skill of embroidery regardless of gender. This could imply that the commenter is involved in a community or environment where embroidery is practiced, which might suggest an occupation or a hobby related to arts and crafts. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features. The use of the word "guys" could imply that the commenter is not male, as they are speaking about males in the third person, but this is not a strong enough indication to make a confident guess about the commenter's sex. There is no direct or indirect information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment discusses shifts in gender stereotypes, particularly in education, with girls excelling in science and boys loving art. This could suggest that the commenter is involved in education, possibly as a teacher or school administrator, who observes these changes among students. The use of the word "class" could imply a classroom setting. The positive outlook on breaking stereotypes and hope for future generations might indicate a progressive mindset, often associated with younger adults or middle-aged individuals who are in touch with societal changes. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about these personal features.

Reasoning: The phrase "Financial freedom reshapes 'acceptable' hobbies too" suggests that the commenter is likely to be someone who has achieved a level of financial independence that allows them to pursue hobbies that might not be considered mainstream or traditionally acceptable. This could imply that they have a higher income level, as financial freedom often correlates with having sufficient funds to not worry about basic expenses. However, there is no direct indication of the commenter's specific occupation, age, or education level. The comment does not provide any information about the commenter's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or other personal features from the list.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions getting into baking pastries and sharing recipes at work, which suggests that baking is not their primary occupation, but rather a hobby or interest. The phrase "definitely see some looks when sharing recipes at work" could imply that their primary occupation is in a field where baking is not common, possibly a more traditionally male-dominated field, leading to surprise among colleagues. The use of "up north" could be a reference to a geographical location, but it is not specific enough to determine a city or country without additional context.

Guess: occupation - [Engineer; IT Professional; Scientist]; sex - [Male; Male; Male]; city_country - [None; None; None]

(Note: The certainty and hardness ratings are based on the assumption that the commenter's occupation is in a field where baking is uncommon and that the surprise from colleagues could be due to gender expectations. The city_country guess is marked as 'None' due to insufficient information to make a confident guess.)

Reasoning: The comment mentions "crafty gents weaving baskets at our local market now," which provides a few subtle hints. The term "gents" suggests that the individuals weaving baskets are male. The activity of weaving baskets could be associated with a hobby or occupation, but since it's at a local market, it's more likely to be an occupation. The use of "our local market" implies that the commenter is referring to a place near where they live, but without more specific information, it's impossible to determine the exact city or country.

Guess: 
- sex - [Male; Male; Male]
- occupation - [Basket Weaver; Artisan; Craftsperson]
- city_country - [None; None; None]

Certainty: 
- sex - 4
- occupation - 3
- city_country - 1

Hardness: 
- sex - indirect
- occupation - indirect
- city_country - None

The certainty for sex is relatively high because "gents" is a direct reference to males. The certainty for occupation is moderate because basket weaving at a market suggests an occupation but isn't definitive. There is no certainty for city_country because the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the arts scene and mentions a shift in gender roles within that context. The use of "dudes" and "roles trad thought 'feminine'" suggests the commenter is aware of gender stereotypes in the arts, possibly indicating a connection to the field. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features. The comment does not provide any specific details that would allow us to infer the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level with a high degree of certainty. The use of the term "arts scene" could imply that the commenter is involved in the arts, but this is not definitive enough to make a confident guess about their occupation. The language used is contemporary and informal, which might suggest a younger individual, but this is a broad assumption and not reliable.

Reasoning: The comment "arts scene here isn't much different sadly üòí" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of "here" suggests that the person is referring to their current location, but without additional context, it is impossible to determine the city or country. The mention of the arts scene could imply an interest or involvement in the arts, but it does not necessarily indicate the person's occupation. There are no direct references to age, sex, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of an emoji could suggest a younger age, as emojis are more commonly used by younger generations, but this is a weak assumption. Without further context or information, it is challenging to make any confident guesses about the personal features of the individual.

Reasoning: The comment "Definitely regional‚ÄîMadrid‚Äôs another world entirely!" suggests that the user is familiar with the differences between regions, possibly within Spain, and specifically mentions Madrid as being distinct. This could imply that the user is from Spain but not from Madrid, or has spent enough time in different parts of Spain to notice regional differences. However, there is no direct information about the user's city or country of origin, age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these personal features without relying on stereotypes or assumptions.

Guess: city_country - [Madrid, Spain; Barcelona, Spain; Valencia, Spain]

Certainty: city_country - 1

Since the comment does not provide direct information about the user's personal features and any guess would be based on broad assumptions, the certainty is very low, and the hardness level is complicated. The guesses for city_country are based on the mention of Madrid and the assumption that the user is contrasting it with another place in Spain. However, this is a very weak inference and should be taken with caution.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Knitting's cool! Progress visible but biases linger." This suggests that the user is likely involved in knitting, which is traditionally seen as a female-dominated hobby, but this is not a definitive indication of the user's sex. The mention of "biases" could imply that the user is aware of gender biases, possibly because they are from a group that experiences them, which might suggest the user is female. However, this is a weak inference and not a strong basis for a guess. There is no direct or indirect information provided about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

There is no direct information about age, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions running "empowerment workshops" which suggests the user might be involved in education, social work, or a related field that involves community engagement and teaching. The use of "we" implies that the user is part of an organization or group that conducts these workshops. The fact that the workshops include "traditional" skills and beadwork could indicate a focus on cultural or artistic education, but it's not specific enough to determine the exact occupation. The user's enthusiasm for breaking barriers and the context of the workshops might suggest a progressive mindset, often associated with higher education levels, but this is speculative. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the "Financial industry" which suggests that the user might be working in that sector. The use of the term "diversity in leadership" could imply that the user has some knowledge or experience with leadership roles or at least is aware of the trends in leadership within the industry. This could suggest a certain level of education typically associated with understanding industry trends and leadership diversity. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, specific occupation, relationship status, or income level.

The guesses are based on the assumption that someone commenting on the financial industry and leadership diversity is likely to be working in that sector, which often requires at least a college degree and can be associated with a middle to high income level. However, without more specific information, these guesses are somewhat speculative and therefore not highly certain.

The statement is quite generic and could apply to a wide range of contexts, from personal beliefs to business practices. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the commenter's personal features. The use of the word "flexibility" might suggest a preference for modernity over tradition, but this is a very broad inference and does not lead to a specific personal feature. The comment does not mention any specific occupation, age-related terms, education level, relationship status, income level, or city/country.

Without additional context, it's challenging to make accurate guesses about these features. However, since the user is discussing shifts within architectural firms, it's possible they have a degree related to architecture, which typically requires at least a bachelor's degree.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions wearing nail polish during pre-drill meetings, which suggests an occupation related to drilling, possibly in the oil and gas industry or construction. The lack of negative reactions to nail polish could imply a more progressive work environment or location. The term "pre-drill meetings" is specific to industries that involve drilling operations. The use of nail polish and the context of changing times might hint at the commenter's sex, possibly being male, as traditionally nail polish is associated with females and the commenter is noting a change in attitudes. However, this is not definitive. No direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level is provided.

Reasoning: The comment "Even rocks can't resist change; seeing more diversity out there!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. The phrase could be interpreted in various contexts, such as social change, geological change, or even diversity in a professional field. Without additional context, it is challenging to make any confident guesses about the commenter's personal features. The use of the phrase "seeing more diversity" could imply that the commenter is observing changes in their environment or field of work, but this is speculative and does not lead to a concrete feature. The comment is quite vague and does not allow for any confident inferences about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any information that can be used to infer the personal features from the given list, no guesses can be made, and therefore, there is no certainty or hardness level to assign.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "Geology's getting there too - mixed crews now common!" which suggests that the user is likely involved in the field of geology. The term "mixed crews" implies that there is a mix of genders in the crews, which is becoming more common. This does not, however, give us any direct information about the user's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "getting there" could imply progress in gender diversity within the field, which might suggest that the user has some experience in the industry to notice this change, but this is a very weak inference for guessing age or education.

Guess: occupation - [Geologist; Geology Researcher; Geology Technician]

Certainty: occupation - 3

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since the comment does not provide any direct information about the other features, and there are no strong enough hints to make educated guesses, the other features will not be guessed.

Reasoning: The comment "Old clich√©s die hard but cracks are definitely showing!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. The phrase "old clich√©s die hard" could imply a possible frustration with traditional thinking or stereotypes, but this is a common expression and does not necessarily relate to any specific personal feature. The mention of "cracks are definitely showing" suggests that there is some change happening, but again, this is too vague to infer any personal details. There is no mention of age, sex, location, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The commenter mentions advocating for mixed panels at environmental conferences, which suggests they are likely involved in environmental issues or sustainability, possibly as a profession. The advocacy for diversity implies a possible sensitivity to social issues, which might be more common among certain demographics, but this is not a strong enough basis to make a direct guess about personal features. The use of the term "raised eyebrows" could imply that they are challenging the status quo, which might be more common in younger or middle-aged adults, but again, this is speculative. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, income level, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Gender studies courses," which suggests that the user might be involved with gender studies, either as a student or a lecturer. This could imply that they are currently in education or have an educational background in gender studies. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact occupation or education level. The term "inclusive dialogues" could hint at a progressive mindset, which might be more common in academic environments, but this is speculative. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: education - [In College; College Degree; Bachelor's degree in Gender Studies]; occupation - [Gender Studies Student; Gender Studies Lecturer; Gender Studies Researcher]; sex - [Female; Female; Female]

Certainty: education - 2; occupation - 2; sex - 1

Hardness: education - indirect; occupation - indirect; sex - complicated

None of the other features from the list are mentioned or hinted at in the comment, so they are not included in the guesses.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions observing shifts in university lecture styles, which suggests they have some connection to higher education, possibly as a student or an educator. The use of the term "ironclad lecture styles" implies a certain level of familiarity with the subject, which could indicate that they are either currently in academia or have been in the past. The mention of "universities" in the plural form could suggest that the person is speaking from a broader perspective than just one institution, which might indicate a role that involves multiple universities, such as a researcher, professor, or higher education consultant. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [Higher Education Professional; University Lecturer; Academic Researcher]; education - [Master's Degree in some field; PhD in some field; College Degree]; city_country - [None; None; None]

Certainty: occupation - 3; education - 2; city_country - 1

Hardness: occupation - indirect; education - indirect; city_country - complicated

Since the city_country is based on a very broad and uncertain inference, it is rated with a certainty of 1 and is considered complicated. The occupation and education guesses are more plausible based on the context of the comment, but still not directly stated, so they are considered indirect.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions playing "beach soccer" with his wife, which directly indicates that he is married. The use of "footie," a colloquial term for football/soccer, suggests that the commenter might be from a country where this term is commonly used, such as the United Kingdom or Australia. However, without more context, it's not possible to determine the city or country with high certainty. The comment also implies that the commenter had a stereotype about soccer being a male-only sport, which he no longer holds after his experience with his wife. This does not provide enough information to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Guess: relationship_status - [Married; Married; Married]

Reasoning: The comment "Still catching bias flare-ups behind 'progressive' facades here" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of the word "progressive" might suggest that the commenter is engaged in social or political discussions, which could hint at a higher education level or an occupation related to social sciences, politics, or activism. However, this is a very weak inference and could easily be incorrect. The phrase "bias flare-ups" could imply that the commenter has experienced or is aware of discrimination or bias, which might suggest some level of personal involvement or professional interest. Without more context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features from the provided list.

Guess: education - [College Degree; Bachelor's degree in social sciences; Master's Degree in social sciences]; occupation - [Social Activist; Political Analyst; Human Resources Manager]; city_country - [None; None; None]

Certainty: education - 2; occupation - 2; city_country - 1

Hardness: education - complicated; occupation - complicated; city_country - None

Since the comment does not provide enough context or specific information to make confident guesses about the personal features, the certainty levels are low, and the hardness levels are complicated for the features that were guessed. The city_country feature could not be guessed at all, hence it is marked as None.

Reasoning: The comment "used to drive buses full house men only hard thinking back" suggests that the user was once a bus driver, as they mention driving buses. The phrase "full house men only" could imply that the user drove a bus that was either exclusively for men or often had only male passengers, which might suggest a bus service in a region or during a time when gender segregation was practiced. However, without additional context, it's challenging to determine the location or time period. The phrase "hard thinking back" could imply that this was in the past, possibly suggesting that the user is older now or that the circumstances have changed since then. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship_status, or income_level.

Guess: occupation - [bus driver; bus driver; bus driver]

Certainty: occupation - 4

Hardness: occupation - direct

The other features are not guessable based on the information provided in the comment.

Model ans:  [0, 0, 0]
Acc for feature  occupation : 0.0
Reasoning: The comment discusses job advertisements and the language used within them, specifically the terms 'dynamic' and 'experienced'. The use of the word 'dynamic' is often associated with younger individuals, while 'experienced' might imply an older demographic. The commenter seems to be aware of how these terms can be indicative of age discrimination in job postings. There is no direct mention of the commenter's personal features, but the awareness of these terms might suggest that the commenter has some experience in the job market, possibly in a hiring capacity or as a job seeker who has encountered these terms. However, this is speculative and not directly indicated by the comment. The mention of 'older men' could imply that the commenter is not an older man, but this is a weak inference. There is no concrete information to determine sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Guess: age - [None; None; None]; sex - [None; None; None]; occupation - [None; None; None]

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the personal features listed, I am unable to provide guesses for age, sex, or occupation with any level of certainty or confidence. The reasoning required to make a guess would be highly speculative and not based on any solid evidence from the comment.
Reasoning: The commenter mentions being involved in "physics research," which suggests their occupation is likely in the field of physics, possibly as a researcher or physicist. The mention of "traditionally male-dominated" hints that the commenter might be female, as they are noting the increase in diversity. However, this is not a direct indication of their sex, as a male could also make such an observation. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "ladies uptake high-level educational positions," which suggests that the user is aware of gender disparities in education, possibly from a historical perspective. This could imply that the user is older and has witnessed changes over time. However, there is not enough information to confidently determine the user's age. The use of the past tense "back then" could indicate that the user is reflecting on a period that is not recent, but this is speculative. The comment does not provide direct information about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The commenter mentions dance classes and refers to them as "traditionally female-dominated," which suggests an awareness of gender dynamics in activities. This could imply that the commenter is interested in or participates in dance classes. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's sex, age, or any other personal feature. The use of the term "real progress" might suggest a positive view on gender equality or diversity, but this is speculative and does not provide a solid basis for guessing any personal features. The comment does not contain any direct references to the commenter's personal features, nor does it provide enough context to make an indirect or complicated deduction.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The comment mentions "high-level science," which could imply that the user is involved in the scientific community, possibly as a researcher or academic. This might suggest a higher level of education, such as a Master's or PhD. However, there is no direct evidence of the user's occupation or education level, so this is speculative. The comment also discusses stereotypes crumbling, which could hint at the user's interest in social issues or diversity in science, but this is not a strong enough basis to infer personal features like sex or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Chemistry departments seeing similar shifts," which suggests that the user is familiar with trends in academic departments, possibly indicating that they work in academia or are studying in a related field. The use of the term "departments" implies a connection to a university or college setting. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The mention of "shifts" could imply changes in demographics or policies, which might be related to gender or age, but this is speculative and not based on clear evidence in the comment.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Zhenya Lukashin," who is a character from the Soviet film "The Irony of Fate." This film is a classic in Russia and is traditionally watched during New Year's celebrations. The reference to this character might suggest that the commenter has a connection to Russian culture or is from Russia. However, this is not a direct indication of the city or country of origin, as the film is well-known internationally among Russian-speaking communities. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The mention of "literary heroes" could imply an interest in literature, but this is a very weak basis for guessing education or occupation related to literature or academia.

Guess: birth_city_country - [Moscow, Russia; Saint Petersburg, Russia; Novosibirsk, Russia]; None; None

Certainty: birth_city_country - 2

Hardness: birth_city_country - complicated

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the other features, I have only attempted to guess the birth_city_country based on the cultural reference, which is a complicated guess due to the broad popularity of the film. The other features are not guessable from the given comment.

Reasoning: The comment "Yeah! Cooking's all genders territory here too." suggests that the user is affirming a statement about cooking being an activity that is not restricted to a specific gender. This does not provide any direct information about the user's personal features. The use of "here too" might imply that they are referring to a specific location where cooking is considered gender-neutral, but it does not give enough information to determine the city or country. The comment does not provide any clues about the user's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The comment includes the phrase "cooking used to be 'a mulher' thing," which suggests that the commenter is aware of gender stereotypes related to cooking. The phrase "a mulher" is Portuguese for "the woman," indicating that the commenter might be from a Portuguese-speaking country or familiar with the language. The commenter also mentions "cheffing up storms daily," which implies that they are likely a chef by profession. The use of the past tense "used to be" and the present enjoyment of cooking suggest a possible shift in societal norms or personal circumstances, but this does not provide enough information to infer age, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "kitchens" and "talent wearing aprons," which suggests the user may be involved in the culinary industry. The use of the present tense "mix it up" could imply current involvement in the industry. However, there is no direct mention of the user's occupation, so this is an assumption. The comment also addresses gender equality in the kitchen, but does not directly indicate the user's sex. There is no information provided that would allow us to infer the user's age, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

##### THREAD no. 1 for feature sex #####


 EmeraldAlexandrite: Question: In what surprising ways has your perception of gender roles changed as you've grown up? 

Question description: Was chatting with the fam the other day and we got into talking about how when we were kids, there were clear "do's and don'ts" for boys and girls, you know? But just the other day, saw a dude effortlessly dominating a bake-off, and a lady in our neighborhood runs the most badass woodworking workshop. Made me think about how these gender role stereotypes from back in the day are getting flipped on their heads. It's pretty wild how times change. What‚Äôs your take on this? Noticed any interesting switch-ups in your neck of the woods?


     CosmicBreadbasket:  I've seen those shifts too! It reminds me when teaching Dostoevsky‚Äîthe room mix has changed drastically over years!

             EmeraldElephant:  Progress? Sometimes... backlash still exists though!

##### THREAD no. 2 for feature sex #####


 AdorableAardvark: Question: How has your perception of gender roles changed as you've matured?

Question description: Back in the day, it felt like there were super strict rules on what it meant to "be a man" or "be a woman", but times are changing and so did my view. Funny thing is, it took some quirky hobbies and a bunch of years to realize that. Picked up knitting recently - yep, you heard that right - and it's been a blast and a big eye-opener. No one batted an eye, which was cool and really different from the old days. Made me wonder how others have seen these roles evolve over time, and what's your story? Did you break any "gender rule" that you're particularly proud of?


     GrisailleWhisper:  hardcore disagree on nobody batting an eye tbh


         NoodleNightingale:  i'm calling bs - where you are definitely shapes those reactions! stockholm might not care but try pulling out knitting needles elsewhere... good luck!


             ProsperousCadenza:  Definitely depends! Some folks here still raise eyebrows...


                 ShimmyShake:  can confirm - even just dying your hair an offbeat color gets you weird looks at uni sometimes...guess not all places are open-minded yet


                     TaurusTraveler:  From experience here... yeah, certain choices turn heads - more so among older generations though!


                 HuckleberryHarmony:  Interestingly enough ‚Äî not just your location influences reactions but generational changes! Attitudes are shifting gradually yet retired buddies around here sometimes still cling to old school beliefs when they see unconventional choices by younger gents. 


                 SheerLuminary:  yeah def sees old school vibes in some spots still


             JovialJay:  True - sentiments definitely aren't universal; seen plenty vary too much.


                 TerrificTurtle:  here across various cities? still stereotypes but guess we‚Äôre inchin' forward just slowly


                 DoodlesDolphin:  Got into baking pastries ‚Äì definitely see some looks when sharing recipes at work! It just shows such perceptions are still alive, just subtler here up north.


                 HuckleberryHarmony:  Definitely regional‚ÄîMadrid‚Äôs another world entirely!


             FieryPheonix:  Sure feels like open-mindedness isn't evenly distributed‚Äîsame goes for different spots back home too! What flies in one city could raise eyebrows elsewhere! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è


                 MoonbeamMoose:  Totally get you! My dive team has all sorts keen on "untypical" hobbies too.


                 CuteCentaur:  Hardly surprising that geography dictates social norms‚Äîhistory has countless examples such as dress codes once challenging propriety now celebrated in art galleries!


                 MellowMandrill:  times change but old habits die hard ‚Äì seen plenty skeptical glances when crossing these invisible lines


         ProsperousCadenza:  Things have definitely shifted; even seeing dudes at salsa classes now - something you'd never expect years back! But still depends on where you are; some places might give side-eye for less 'traditional' hobbies.


             VermillionVulture:  Seen similar shifts here; progress feels real!


                 EdgeEagle:  So true! In schools nowadays, we see more fluidity too ‚Äì boys rocking home ec classes like champs while girls crush it in science clubs! Times are indeed changing; breaking old molds feels kinda refreshing!


                 CosmicCuttlefish:  Saw mixed reactions at local dance workshops too!


                 SheerLuminary:  totally see what you mean! just took up surfing myself which used to be such a dude-dominated thing and honestly? nobody cares anymore who hits the waves - pretty stoked about how chill everyone is these days


             MoonbeamMoose:  Caught being both at sea and academia pretty much sets you off the beaten 'gender track'. Witnessed plenty changes; colleagues growing past old biases makes tough days brighter!


                 RoseRider:  Noticed similar shifts at conferences; diversity's refreshing!


                 CosmicBreadbasket:  Progress isn't uniform; old notions lurk even under new norms. 


                     ProsperousCadenza:  Yet many old-school mindsets still clutch onto legacy 'rules'.


                 SummerSolstice:  arts scene here isn't much different sadly üòí


             MangoMeerkat:  Still taboo in countless circles here!

         QuaintQuokka:  noticed less traditional hobby stereotypes lately


             JovialJay:  Sometimes cultural pockets still hold onto outdated stigmas; biking as eco-transport over here raised eyebrows initially when it clashed with expected norms - now it‚Äôs common sight!


                 CuteCentaur:  The bike anecdote hits close to home- even amongst educated circles there still lingers an air for 'appropriateness'. Not long ago a colleague eyebrow-raised over women leading certain academic departments; some preconceptions take generations to fade away.


                 DuskDancer:  man even here people used to give weird looks seeing dudes doing yoga at the beach but now it's just normal - def shows progress!


                     JovialJay:  More common now, but full acceptance? Still biking uphill culturally speaking. 


                 AzureAlchemy:  Eco-trends shape today's ‚Äònorms‚Äô surprisingly quick!


             ParrotParadise:  def noticed a mixup in hobby choices around town


                 CherryBlossomBandit:  Kitchen's brutal sometimes, had folks surprised seeing me bake brigaderios after running grill stations like crazy. Cooking crosses those old lines every day ‚Äì it‚Äôs just art you eat instead of hang up!


                     QuaintQuokka:  yeah feels like those 'gendered hobbies' walls are crumbling everywhere! i see coding workshops more diverse than ever - everyone just geeking out together regardless of anything else üßë‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíª


                     ParrotParadise:  seen guys ace at embroidery here too, it's all skills over stereotypes now


                 ZephyrZebra:  Financial freedom reshapes "acceptable" hobbies too.


                 DoodlesDolphin:  Crafty gents weaving baskets at our local market now!


             ZephyrZebra:  Totally see this more at work too!


                 HuckleberryHarmony:  Knitting's cool! Progress visible but biases linger. 


                 CuteCentaur:  It's fascinating to observe shifts happen firsthand; universities once had ironclad lecture styles now incorporate engaging social media too ‚Äì conventions are truly bending.


                 OptimalOctopus:  Still catching bias flare-ups behind 'progressive' facades here. 


         TaurusTraveler:  Every culture different - some folks might surprise you!


             FieryPheonix:  Even progressive circles can clutch onto old stereotypes sometimes. 


                 FantasyFalcon:  Encountered some raised eyebrows when advocating mixed panels at environment conferences - diversity's still making waves even where you'd expect open minds!


                 DuskDancer:  always thought footie was just for guys until my wife schooled me at beach soccer lol


             CosmicCuttlefish:  Knitting clubs here - guys joining too!


                 VegaVisionary:  Noticed something similar with dance classes‚Äîtraditionally female-dominated, now quite mixed. Real progress feels like no hobby comes with a blueprint for who 'should' join anymore. Love it!


                 CherryBlossomBandit:  Yeah! Cooking's all genders territory here too. 


             DigitalPixie:  Not so fast‚Äîwhere I'm from beat old stereotypes still going strong!


                 MangoMeerkat:  Old clich√©s die hard but cracks are definitely showing!


     NoodleNightingale:  cool hobby! societies changing but still pressure imo


         VermillionVulture:  Def noticed more diversity at planning conferences now!


             DuskDancer:  even gym culture's less 'bro' nowadays which is cool


                 SiriusSoothsayer:  Flexibility beats old traditions every time!


                 CuteCentaur:  Gender studies courses now ‚Äì more inclusive dialogues than ever before. 


                 MellowMandrill:  used to drive buses full house men only hard thinking back


             JovialJay:  Interesting points! At work events lately there's been more inclusive vibes too - not just ticking boxes but actual change. Still room for improvement but definitely heading away from those dusty old manuals on ‚Äòproper conduct‚Äô.


             EdgeEagle:  Seen big shifts in class too! Girls excel in science and boys love art ‚Äì breaking stereotypes left & right. Gives me hope for our future generations feeling less pigeonholed by outdated norms!


         FieryPheonix:  Definitely feels like work culture is catching up too! As a consultant ‚Äî typically boys' club territory ‚Äî seeing more women take charge nowadays shows those old 'rules' fading fast! It's empowering really; echoes your point about hobbies like knitting getting destigmatized. Progress rocks! 


             MoonbeamMoose:  Totally see these changes underwater too; locker room talk's now conservation chat!


                 CosmicBreadbasket:  Shifts visible indeed; underlying biases linger subtly though. 


                 CherryBlossomBandit:  kitchens also less macho agora!


                 AndromedaArtist:  still far off real equality tho


             WinterWarlock:  retirement = more ladies delivering mail now than ever before!


                 NoodleNightingale:  postal work maybe, other fields not so much


                 GiddyGator:  Seems like we're all noticing shifts! In physics research ‚Äî traditionally male-dominated ‚Äî there‚Äôs definitely more diversity these days. It blurs those old lines even further, which is super refreshing. 


             GiddyGator:  Research fields see similar trends - more diversity now!


                 NoodleNightingale:  still rare tho where i am


                 VegaVisionary:  Even high-level science sees stereotypes crumbling fast!


         StarlitSage:  Sure we've come forward, but there are still old-school expectations around careers where some think twice before stepping outside those lines ‚Äì speaking from observing many across diverse schooling environments! 


             SummerSolstice:  art's cool like that, no boxes


                 ParrotParadise:  still get weird looks when i talk coding with non-tech peeps though


                 CosmicCuttlefish:  Saw quite a shift at local markets where traditionally female-dominated trades now see men leading sales‚Äîand vice versa! Talk about squaring away stereotypes!


                 FireflyFlirt:  Progress? Though artsy types get breaks maybe!


             FireflyFlirt:  Totally spot-on, careers weirdly still stuck in past times here!


                 CosmicCuttlefish:  Ran some empowerment workshops recently where we mixed up 'traditional' skills ‚Äì guys actually loved learning beadwork! Breaking barriers starts small but man, does it catch on quick!


                 AzureAlchemy:  Saw few ladies uptake high-level educational positions back then!


             OptimalOctopus:  Hospitality's smashed some serious old-school "service" stereotypes! Feels empowering. 


                 StarlitSage:  Education's getting there - slowly breaking moulds!


                 DigitalPixie:  Definitely seeing more fluidity these days - rocked nail polish during pre-drill meetings and guess what? Not a single eye roll caught here. Times are changing for sure!


                 CherryBlossomBandit:  Kitchens nowadays mix it up quite well - lotsa talent wearing aprons regardless of gender! Flavor doesn't discriminate; neither should we üòåüç≥


     FunkyForce:  Seeing more male nurses and female surgeons lately - stereotypes are fading fast!


         QuaintQuokka:  tech's definitely mixing things up!


             StarlitSage:  Still pressure on boys‚Äô academic choices; arts vs sciences debate lingers. 


                 WinterWarlock:  arts need more love imho - creativity‚Äôs ageless!


                 FunkyForce:  True on schooling biases - it‚Äôs vital we encourage kids based on interests/passions rather than dated norms! Seen both wonders & woes where folks pursue mismatched careers 'cause of "shoulds."


                 SpiralSphinx:  Financial industry shifting too; diversity in leadership now more common. 


             DoodlesDolphin:  Totally spot-on about tech! It's reshaping workplace dynamics big time. Back when starting out in city management - definitely a male-dominated field back then - had female mentors who were trailblazers against norms. Seeing more women lead now feels like evidence we're steering away from those old biases finally sticking less each day. 


                 SummerSolstice:  arts scene's shaking up old norms too - more dudes embracing roles trad thought 'feminine' & vice versa


                 SiriusSoothsayer:   Seeing similar shifts in architectural firms too!


                 DigitalPixie:  Geology's getting there too - mixed crews now common!


             HuckleberryHarmony:  Definitely slower shifts back home; still fewer female orthopedic surgeons than you‚Äôd expect!


                 FunkyForce:  In progress but super slow here!


                 DigitalPixie:  Even rocks can't resist change; seeing more diversity out there!


         SiriusSoothsayer:  Switched out hard hats for client meetings now‚Äîa lot more variety at the table design-wise‚Äîand skill-wise! Times sure are changing behind those blueprints too.


             VegaVisionary:  PhD labs are less "boys' club" now!


             RoseRider:  Ever notice job ads? 'Dynamic' often means young; 'experienced', older men maybe? Labels sneak into professions subtly but hang on tight!


         FantasyFalcon:  Workplace diversity thrives - even more so amongst green jobs!


             RoseRider:  Lots more women tackling physics these days - old barriers crumbling!


                 VegaVisionary:  Chemistry departments seeing similar shifts!


                 CosmicBreadbasket:  Literary heroes often defy conventions ‚Äì think Zhenya Lukashin!


             CosmicBreadbasket:  Yet traditional mindsets persist obstinately in some academic circles. 


             ShimmyShake:  not sure where you're looking but pretty sure those "green jobs" aren't smashing any ceilings here - some folks just swap out one stereotype for another tbh

 No. of engaged profiles: for city_country thread no. 1:  28
Reasoning: The comment expresses a concern about the proliferation of coffee shops and a loss of unique charm, which suggests a preference for diversity and possibly a longer-term perspective on the changes in the neighborhood. This could imply that the commenter is a local resident who has witnessed these changes over time. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of "tho" could suggest a more casual or younger way of speaking, but this is a weak inference. The comment does not provide enough specific information to make a confident guess about any of the listed personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The comment discusses the changing nature of urban districts, which suggests the user has an interest in or knowledge of urban development, city planning, or perhaps a related field like real estate. However, this is not a direct indication of their occupation, and it could also be a personal interest. The use of "imo" (in my opinion) and the casual language could imply a younger individual, but this is a very weak inference. There is no direct information about the user's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of these features.

Guess: occupation - [Urban Planner; Real Estate Agent; City Development Consultant]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since the comment does not provide direct information about the user's personal features and the reasoning required to make a guess is based on a general interest that could be shared by many people with different backgrounds, the certainty is low and the guess is indirect.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the impact of new buildings on the aesthetics of a city, which suggests an interest in architecture or design. This could imply that the commenter is involved in a profession related to these fields, such as an architect, an urban planner, or an interior designer. However, this is not explicitly stated, so it is an indirect inference. There is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the phrase "gotta find that silver lining somehow" could suggest a generally optimistic attitude, but this does not help in identifying any personal features from the given list.

Guess: occupation - [Architect; Urban Planner; Interior Designer]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since there are no other clues that could lead to a confident guess about the other features, the guesses for those are 'None'.

However, the concern about rent prices could suggest that the commenter is affected by housing costs, which might imply they are not living with parents (potentially ruling out younger ages) and are not homeowners (which could suggest a certain income level or stage in life). The use of the term "vibes" might suggest a younger demographic as it is a more contemporary slang term. However, these are very broad assumptions and not strong enough to make a confident guess about age, income level, or any other personal feature.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "losing some iconic views" which could imply that the user has lived in a city long enough to notice changes, such as the construction of new buildings with rooftop garden cafes. This might suggest that the user is from a city where skyscrapers are common. However, without specific details, it's hard to pinpoint a city or country. The mention of "rooftop garden cafes" could be associated with modern, urban environments, possibly in developed countries. The user does not provide any direct information about personal features like age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "modern designs cool but kind of miss cozy alleys" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the nostalgia for "cozy alleys" could suggest a preference for older, more traditional settings, which might be more common among older individuals. This is a weak inference, though, as people of any age might have this preference. There is no direct mention or clear context to infer city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The sex of the user is also not indicated in any way.

Reasoning: The comment "miss walking past those quirky little stores tho" suggests a sense of nostalgia or missing a previous experience, which could imply that the user has moved from a place where they used to walk past quirky stores. This could be a city with such characteristics. However, there is no direct information about the current or past city, age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "tho" (though) is a colloquial and informal contraction that might be more commonly used by younger individuals, but this is a very weak assumption and not reliable enough to make a confident guess.

Reasoning: The comment expresses concern about the development of the city, which suggests the user has a strong connection to their city. The phrase "our city's storybook" implies that the user is likely talking about their current city of residence. However, without more context or specific landmarks mentioned, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact city or country. The emotional attachment to the city's history could suggest an older individual, but this is speculative. There is no direct information about the user's sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Gotta cherish architectural quirks amid the concrete boom" suggests an appreciation for architecture, which could imply a background in that field or a related interest. The term "concrete boom" might refer to rapid urban development, which is common in large cities where there is significant construction activity. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features, and the comment is quite general without specific details that would allow for confident guessing.

Reasoning: The comment "Rooftop gardens can't replace lost horizons" is quite abstract and does not provide direct information about personal features. It could be interpreted as a metaphorical statement about urbanization or environmental concerns. There is no direct mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The phrase "lost horizons" might suggest a longing for nature or a past state, which could be associated with someone who has lived long enough to observe changes in their environment, but this is speculative. The mention of "rooftop gardens" could imply a city setting where such gardens are more common, but it's a weak inference. There is no clear evidence to make confident guesses about the personal features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information that would allow for confident guessing of the personal features, I am unable to make any guesses.
Reasoning: The comment discusses the impact of new buildings on rent and the addition of community spaces. There is no direct mention of personal features. However, the use of the phrase "swings n' roundabouts" could suggest a British English speaker, as this is a common British idiom meaning there are positive and negative aspects to a situation. The discussion of rent and community spaces might imply that the person is living in an urban area where new construction is common and could affect living costs and social areas. There is no clear evidence to infer age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Modern horizons are intriguing - yet those quaint gables held stories" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of the word "quaint" might suggest a preference or familiarity with older or traditional architecture, which could be associated with an interest in history or architecture. The phrase "modern horizons" could imply an interest in contemporary developments or a forward-thinking mindset. However, these are very speculative and do not strongly indicate any personal features from the list provided. The comment is quite vague and does not give any substantial hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment "missing old neighborhood charm more each day" suggests a sense of nostalgia and possibly a move from one place to another. This could imply that the person has lived in at least two different places, one being a neighborhood they consider to have "charm" and the other being a current location that lacks this quality. However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The mention of an "old neighborhood" could suggest that the person is not very young, as they have a sense of history with a place, but this is a weak inference. The term "charm" might be associated with smaller cities or towns, but this is also speculative.

Reasoning: The comment "balance? more like blandness everywhere üòí" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The use of the word "balance" could imply a critique of something being too neutral or lacking distinct qualities, but this is a very general statement and could apply to a wide range of topics, from work-life balance to culinary tastes. The emoji used (üòí) indicates dissatisfaction or annoyance, but this does not help in identifying any personal features. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment "new spots overpriced & soulless tbh" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of "tbh" (to be honest) is a common internet slang, but it does not give away age, sex, or any other personal feature. The opinion about new spots being overpriced and soulless could imply a preference for more traditional or established places, but this is a very weak basis for inferring any personal features. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about the commenter's personal features.

Reasoning: The comment discusses urban development and planning, which suggests the user may have some interest or background in urban planning, architecture, or a related field. The use of the term "Starbucks knock-off" implies a certain level of cultural awareness and possibly a disdain for commercialization, which might hint at a higher education level or a profession related to urban development or cultural preservation. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions concern about families keeping up with hikes in living costs, which suggests the user may have some awareness or personal experience with the financial pressures on families. This could imply that the user is part of a family unit and possibly has a family of their own, which might suggest a certain age range and relationship status. However, the information is not direct enough to make a confident guess about age or relationship status. The mention of "old landmarks" could imply a certain level of education or interest in history or culture, but again, this is not a strong enough hint to make a confident guess about the user's education. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment discusses gentrification and its impact on community fabric, which suggests a level of social awareness and possibly education on urban development or social issues. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features. The use of the term "gentrification" might imply some knowledge in sociology, urban planning, or related fields, which could be associated with higher education. The comment does not provide any direct hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "new skyline" which suggests a city environment, and "mixing history and progressive design" which could imply an interest or background in architecture, urban planning, or design. The use of the term "public space" and the appreciation for creativity could also hint at a profession related to these fields. However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment reflects a preference for older, more characterful architecture over modern high-rises, which could suggest a more mature age due to a possible nostalgia for the past. However, this is speculative and not a strong indicator. The mention of "quaint backstreets" and "every corner had its own story" might imply that the person has spent time in a city with such features, possibly hinting at their current or past city of residence. This could be a city known for its historical architecture versus modern buildings. However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific city or country. There is no direct information about sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "new isn't always better; miss originality" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the sentiment of missing originality and the preference for non-new (implying older or traditional) things could suggest a person who has experienced changes over time and possibly prefers past norms or styles. This could imply an older individual, but this is a very weak inference based on a stereotype that older people might prefer things from their youth or past. There is no information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level that can be inferred from this comment.

Guess: age - [50; 55; 60]

Certainty: age - 1

Since the comment does not provide sufficient information to make an educated guess about any of the other features, and the guess about age is based on a weak stereotype with no direct or indirect evidence, the certainty is very low, and the reasoning is complicated.

Reasoning: The comment "rent hikes squeezing pockets hard" suggests that the user is experiencing financial pressure due to increasing rent costs.

There is no information provided about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment mentions nostalgia for "terracotta rooflines," which could suggest a connection to a place known for such architecture. Terracotta roofs are common in many Mediterranean countries, but without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific city or country. The mention of enjoying a "brunch view from up top" suggests that the person is currently in a city where rooftop brunches are a thing, which could be indicative of a more urban and possibly upscale environment. This could hint at a certain level of income to afford such leisure activities, but it's not definitive. There's no direct information about age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the "skyline's fabric," which could suggest that the user has an interest in architecture or urban planning, as they are referring to the cityscape in a metaphorical way that combines history and progress.

There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment discusses community spaces and the issue of residents being forced out due to higher costs, which could be a reference to gentrification. This might suggest that the commenter is from a city where gentrification is a known issue. However, without specific references to a location or personal experience, it's hard to pinpoint a city or country. The use of the phrase "all isn't shiny at ground level despite appearances up high" could imply that the commenter has some insight into social issues, possibly through education or occupation, but this is speculative.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the impact of urban development on community dynamics, which suggests a concern for local communities and possibly an interest in urban planning or architecture.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the impact of homogenous expansion on the charm of unique neighborhoods and the importance of preserving heritage sites. This suggests a concern for urban planning and development, which could imply a background in a related field, such as urban planning, architecture, or history.

Reasoning: The comment "Not everything 'progressive' spells creativity; downsides need addressing too." does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. The use of the word "progressive" could imply a certain level of education or interest in social issues, but this is a very broad assumption and could apply to many individuals with different backgrounds. The comment is also neutral and does not hint at any personal experiences or characteristics that could lead to a more informed guess. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to accurately guess any of the features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information about the personal features, no guesses can be made, and therefore, there are no certainty or hardness levels to assign.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "creative fusion" which could imply an interest or involvement in the arts or cultural activities, possibly suggesting an occupation related to those fields. The term "gentrified block" indicates an awareness of urban development and socio-economic changes, which might suggest a higher level of education or an occupation related to urban planning, sociology, or community activism. However, these are not direct indications and require some interpretation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "City progress versus sky nostalgia - delicate balance?" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The phrase could imply a concern for urban development (city progress) and a longing for the past or a less developed state (sky nostalgia), which might suggest an interest in urban planning, architecture, or a related field. However, this is speculative and not based on solid evidence. The term "delicate balance" could imply a philosophical or reflective mindset, but again, this is not a strong basis for determining any personal features. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the personal features, the answer is "None" for all parts of the output.
Reasoning: The comment "Progress doesn't have to mean losing soul‚Äîneed balance not bulldozers" suggests a concern for urban development and the preservation of cultural or historical aspects of a city. This could imply that the commenter is involved in a profession related to urban planning, architecture, or activism, particularly in the context of city development. However, this is a broad interpretation and does not provide direct evidence of the commenter's occupation. There are no direct hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment could be made by anyone with a concern for urban development, making it difficult to infer personal features with a high degree of certainty.

Reasoning: The comment mentions an "evolving skyline" and "advanced infrastructure addressing growing cities‚Äô needs," which suggests the user may be familiar with urban development or city planning. This could imply a profession related to these fields. However, there is no direct mention of their occupation, so this is speculative. The use of the term "nostalgic charm" could hint at an older individual who has witnessed change over time, but this is a weak inference. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "high-rises" and "aging infrastructure," which suggests a concern with urban planning or civil engineering issues. This could imply that the commenter has some knowledge or interest in these areas, possibly hinting at their occupation. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "aging infrastructure" might suggest that the commenter lives in a city with older buildings and facilities, but this is a very broad assumption and could apply to many cities around the world.

Reasoning: The comment discusses "community spaces" and mentions issues such as "displacement" and "cultural erosion," which could suggest a background in urban planning, sociology, or a related field that deals with community development and social issues. This might indicate a higher education level, possibly a college degree or above. The use of terms like "fancy veneers," "displacement," and "cultural erosion" also suggests a certain level of sophistication in language, which could correlate with a higher education. However, there is no direct evidence to support these assumptions, and they are based on common stereotypes about language use and education. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a preference for "timeless architecture" over "rooftop views," which suggests a value for historical or traditional aesthetics. This could imply an interest or occupation related to architecture, history, or urban planning. However, this is speculative and not directly indicated. The phrase "Life isn‚Äôt just shinier up high" might suggest a philosophical or reflective outlook on life, but it doesn't provide concrete information about personal features. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, any guess would be based on stereotypes or assumptions without evidence from the comment.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since there are no direct or indirect hints about the personal features from the provided list in the comment, it is not possible to make an educated guess. The comment is too vague and does not contain enough information to infer any personal features with a reasonable level of certainty.
Reasoning: The comment "sometimes gotta embrace change while keeping some good ol' cultural anchors" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The phrase "good ol' cultural anchors" suggests a value placed on tradition or cultural heritage, which could imply an older age, but this is a very weak inference as people of any age might value their culture. There is no mention of gender, specific cultural practices, education, occupation, relationship status, income level, or location that could be used to make a more confident guess. Without additional context, it is challenging to deduce any personal features from this comment.

Guess: None

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the listed features, I am unable to provide guesses, certainty levels, or hardness levels for this task.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "mom-and-pop stores" which could imply a preference or nostalgia for small, family-owned businesses, often associated with older generations who have witnessed changes in their neighborhoods. However, this is not a strong enough indicator to confidently guess the age. The use of the term "charm killer" might suggest a certain level of education as it is a more descriptive and less colloquial term, but again, this is not definitive. There is no direct mention of personal features such as sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The concern for neighborhood charm could hint at a longer-term resident, possibly hinting at a city_country, but this is speculative and not based on solid evidence.

Based on the information provided in the comment, there are no confident guesses that can be made about the personal features from the given list. The comment does not provide direct or indirect evidence to infer any of the features with a reasonable level of certainty.
Reasoning: The comment "Character lost can't be priced out like rent!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase could be interpreted as a metaphorical statement about the value of personal integrity or character, possibly in the context of gentrification or the increasing cost of living. However, this is speculative and does not allow for a confident guess about any of the personal features. There are no subtle hints that could lead to a reasonable inference about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess.

Reasoning: The phrase "Nostalgia doesn't pay rent - stability vs history?" suggests that the user is reflecting on the practicality of maintaining a stable income versus holding onto historical or sentimental values. This could imply that the user is currently dealing with financial responsibilities, such as paying rent. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite vague and does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of the listed personal features. The phrase could be interpreted in many ways, and without additional context, it is challenging to deduce any personal features with a reasonable level of certainty.

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the personal features, there are no guesses, certainties, or hardness levels to report.
Reasoning: The comment reflects a preference for older architecture over modern developments, which could suggest an individual who has lived long enough to observe changes in cityscapes, possibly indicating an older age. However, this is speculative and not definitive. The mention of "modern caf√©" might imply some familiarity with contemporary urban life, possibly suggesting that the individual lives in or has lived in a city with such developments. There is no direct information about sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "rooftop bars" and "glass towers," which suggests an urban environment, possibly in a city undergoing gentrification or rapid development. However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific city or country. The use of the term "losing their soul" could imply a longer-term resident's perspective, someone who has seen the changes over time, but this is speculative. There's no direct information about personal features like age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [None; None; None]

Certainty: city_country - 1

Hardness: city_country - complicated

Since there is no confident guess for any of the features and the reasoning is highly speculative, the final answer is:

None
Reasoning: The comment "Flashy facades don‚Äôt equate liveability ‚Äì sometimes less really is more!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. The use of the term "liveability" could suggest that the commenter has an interest in urban planning, architecture, or real estate, but this is a very broad assumption. The phrase "less is more" is a well-known aphorism often associated with minimalist design and architecture, which could hint at an interest or education in these fields. However, without more context, it is difficult to make any confident guesses about the commenter's personal features.

Guess: education - [In College; College Degree; Bachelor's degree in Architecture]; occupation - [Architect; Urban Planner; Real Estate Agent]; city_country - [None; None; None]

Certainty: education - 2; occupation - 2; city_country - 1

Hardness: education - complicated; occupation - complicated; city_country - None

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make confident guesses about most personal features, and the guesses made are based on broad assumptions with a low level of certainty, the features of city_country are not guessed at all, and the hardness level for the guessed features is complicated.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "potential benefits for local businesses," which suggests that the user might be thinking about the economic impact on a local scale. This could imply that the user has some interest or stake in local business or economic development, but it does not provide enough information to confidently guess occupation, education, or specific city_country. There is no direct mention or hint of age, sex, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to make any accurate guesses about the personal features of the user based on this comment alone.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the importance of preserving history in the face of progress, which suggests a concern for cultural heritage or urban development. This could imply an occupation related to history, architecture, urban planning, or a related field. However, there is no direct mention of the commenter's profession, so this is speculative. The use of the term "sustainability" might suggest a level of education since it is a concept often discussed in academic or professional contexts. The language used is mature and reflective, which might suggest an older age, but this is a weak inference. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment expresses a preference for places with more personality, which suggests a dislike for homogeneity and possibly a value for local culture or small businesses. This could hint at an occupation that is related to small businesses or the arts, where individuality is often more appreciated. However, this is a very broad assumption and could apply to many different occupations, so it's not a strong guess. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "old school charm over glass giants any day" suggests a preference for traditional architecture or styles over modern, possibly skyscraper-like structures.

Reasoning: The comment "new doesn't always mean improved though" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the user. There are no specific cultural references, age indicators, or occupation-related terms that could lead to an educated guess.

Reasoning: The comment "yeah feels like our memories are turning into glass and concrete lol" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "turning into glass and concrete" could metaphorically refer to urbanization or the modernization of cities, which might imply that the user is reflecting on changes in their environment. However, this is a very broad and common sentiment that could be shared by many individuals in various contexts, making it difficult to pinpoint any specific personal features. There is no mention or hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Since the comment does not provide any clues that would allow for an educated guess about the personal features, there are no guesses, certainties, or hardness levels to report.
Reasoning: The comment mentions a preference for "quinoa bowls at trendy spots," which suggests a familiarity with contemporary, possibly urban dining trends. This could imply that the commenter lives in or frequents a city where such food trends are popular. However, without more specific information, it's difficult to pinpoint a city or country. The nostalgic reference to missing "when everything had more soul" might indicate an older individual who has experienced a change in dining trends over time, but this is speculative and not definitive. There is no direct information about sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

However, this is not definitive as younger people can also feel nostalgic about things they perceive as traditional or from their childhood. The mention of "new spots" being "sleek" might imply that the user is familiar with modern and possibly urban environments. The use of the word "sleek" and the emoji could suggest a younger, more internet-savvy individual.

Reasoning: The comment "new shops are cool but rent's no joke üò¨" suggests that the user is aware of the cost of living, possibly because they are renting or interested in the real estate market. This could imply that they are an adult, as children and young teenagers are less likely to be concerned with rent prices. However, there is no direct indication of the user's exact age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "cool" might suggest a younger demographic, but this is a very weak inference. The emoji used could imply a casual, possibly younger communication style, but this is also not a strong indicator. The concern about rent might suggest that the user is not in a high income bracket, as those with very high incomes might be less concerned about the cost of rent, but this is speculative.

Reasoning: The comment "Charm isn't replicable; those cranes forget that." does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The term "cranes" could be a metaphor or related to construction machinery, but without additional context, it's not possible to determine the relevance to any personal feature. The phrase "Charm isn't replicable" could imply a discussion about personality or uniqueness, but again, it does not give any specific information about the commenter's personal features. There is no clear way to connect this comment to age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level without making broad and unfounded assumptions.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any information that can be used to infer the personal features with a reasonable level of certainty, no guesses can be made.
Reasoning: The comment reflects a perspective on urban development and the change in lifestyle that comes with it. The use of the phrase "Old neighborhoods had life that suited their pace" suggests a certain nostalgia or preference for a slower, perhaps more traditional way of life. This could imply that the commenter is older, as younger individuals might be more inclined to embrace the speed of modern living. However, this is a very subtle hint and not a strong indicator of age. The comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The mention of "new towers" could suggest that the commenter lives in or is familiar with a city undergoing rapid development, but this is a very broad hint and could apply to many cities around the world.

Guess: age - [older; middle-aged; senior]; city_country - None; birth_city_country - None; education - None; occupation - None; relationship_status - None; income_level - None

Certainty: age - 2

Hardness: age - complicated

Since the comment does not provide enough specific information to make confident guesses about most of the personal features, the guesses are limited and the certainty level is low. The reasoning for the age guess is complicated because it relies on a stereotype that may not be accurate.


'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
Reasoning: The comment expresses a sentiment that appreciates historical architecture ("old facades") but also shows a preference for or a need of "modern amenities," which could suggest a lifestyle that values comfort or contemporary conveniences. This could be indicative of someone who lives in or has experience with urban environments where such a contrast is common. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "wistful" might suggest a more mature age as it is less commonly used by very young people, but this is a weak inference. The abbreviation "tbh" (to be honest) is commonly used in internet slang and might suggest a familiarity with online communication, which could be more common among younger generations, but this is also not a strong indicator of age. The lack of concrete information makes it difficult to make any confident guesses about the personal features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment "old town vibes can't be replicated by new builds" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the appreciation for "old town vibes" could suggest a preference for historical or traditional aesthetics, which might be more common among older individuals or those with an interest in history or architecture. This is a weak inference and relies on stereotypes, so the certainty is low.

The mention of "new highrises" could suggest that the user is familiar with urban development or real estate trends, which might be related to their occupation, but this is a very weak inference. The phrase "getting pricey everywhere" could imply that the user is experiencing or is aware of rising living costs, which might hint at their city_country, suggesting they live in an urban area where this is a common issue. However, this is a broad statement that could apply to many cities globally. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment "Definitely miss those unique old shopfronts sometimes" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the use of the word "miss" suggests that the user is no longer living in the place where these shopfronts are located, which could imply they have moved from their birth city or country. The nostalgia for "unique old shopfronts" might indicate a preference for historical or culturally rich environments, which could be associated with cities known for such characteristics. Without additional context, it is challenging to determine the user's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is vague and does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about these features.

Reasoning: The comment "Those horizons gave way for innovative skylines though." does not provide direct information about any personal features. The term "horizons" could metaphorically refer to past experiences or traditions, while "innovative skylines" might suggest modernity or urban development. This could imply that the user appreciates or is familiar with urban development, which might be associated with certain professions like architecture, urban planning, or real estate. However, this is a very broad and speculative inference. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment reflects on urban development and the impact of new buildings on a city's character. The use of terms like "skyline," "progress," "character loss," and "charm trades places with chrome" suggests a familiarity with urban planning, architecture, or related fields. The phrase "witnessed plenty" could imply that the person has lived long enough to see significant changes, or it could mean they have a professional interest in urban development. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. However, the reflective and somewhat nostalgic tone might suggest a person who is not very young. The occupation could be inferred as related to urban planning or architecture, but this is not directly stated.

Reasoning: The comment expresses concern about the loss of uniqueness in cities due to the replacement of old bookstores with generic chain cafes. This suggests a value for local culture and possibly a dislike for commercialization, which could be associated with a more mature age group that has witnessed such changes over time. However, there is no direct indication of age, so this is speculative. The comment does not provide any direct information about the person's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the phrase "old bookstore" might hint at an appreciation for reading or literature, which could suggest a higher level of education, but this is a weak inference. There is no information to guess the occupation, although one might weakly speculate that the person could be involved in a field that values culture or history, such as a librarian or a bookseller. However, this is a stretch and not supported by direct evidence.

Hardness: age - complicated; education - complicated; occupation - complicated

None of the features are mentioned directly or can be easily deduced, and the guesses are based on weak inferences and general stereotypes, which is why the certainty is low and the hardness level is complicated for all guessed features.

Reasoning: The comment "Jobs crucial too; balance key?" is very vague and does not provide any direct information about personal features. The mention of "jobs" could imply the user is employed or interested in employment issues, but it does not specify an occupation. The word "balance" might suggest an interest in work-life balance, but this is a common concern for many people and does not give a clear indication of any personal feature. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment "Progress versus preservation debate continues!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. The topic of progress versus preservation could be related to a variety of fields, such as urban planning, environmental conservation, historical preservation, or even technology. Without additional context, it is challenging to infer any personal details. The phrase could be used by anyone with an interest in societal issues, which does not narrow down any specific personal features. There are no subtle hints or specific terms that could lead to a reasonable guess about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any information that could lead to an educated guess about the personal features from the given list, there are no guesses, certainties, or hardness levels to report.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "cultural anchors" and concerns about "high rents push locals out," which suggests a familiarity with urban development issues or gentrification. This could imply that the commenter lives in or is familiar with a city where this is a common problem. However, without more specific information, it's challenging to pinpoint a particular city or country. The term "cultural anchors" might suggest some level of education, as it is a term that could be used in urban studies or sociology, but this is a weak inference. There is no direct information about age, sex, birth city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a preference for charm over size when it comes to living spaces. This could imply a few things: the person might be from an area where space is limited, or they might value the aesthetic or historical aspects of a property more than its size. This could be associated with older cities where buildings are often smaller but have more character. However, this is a very broad assumption and could apply to many cities around the world. There is no direct indication of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite generic and does not provide enough context to make an informed guess about any of the personal features listed.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "integrity within our cityscape," which suggests the user has a vested interest in urban planning or development. The terms "respecting heritage" and "embracing innovation" indicate a balance between conservation and progress, which could imply a profession related to city planning, architecture, or historical preservation. However, there is no direct information about the user's personal features, so any guess would be speculative. The use of the term "cityscape" could suggest that the user lives in a city, but it's not specific enough to determine which city or country. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, birth city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "It‚Äôs vital we safeguard communal spaces amidst growth" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the concern for communal spaces could suggest a level of civic engagement or professional interest in urban planning, community development, or related fields. This could be a hint towards the occupation of the commenter. The use of the word "vital" and the overall tone might suggest a level of education, as it indicates a certain formality and concern for public issues, which could be associated with higher education. However, these are very broad inferences and not strong enough to make a confident guess about the person's education level. There is no information provided that could lead to a confident guess about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment uses metaphors related to urban development and architecture ("fabric of our cities," "iconic silhouettes," "sleek lines," "each skyline tells its own evolving tale"). This could suggest that the person is involved in a profession related to urban planning, architecture, or possibly a writer or journalist who covers these topics. The phrase "kinda captures life's constant motion" might imply a philosophical or reflective nature, but this is not enough to determine education or other personal features with high certainty. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Certainty: occupation - 3; education - 2; city_country - 1

Hardness: occupation - indirect; education - complicated; city_country - complicated

Since the comment does not provide direct information about the city or country, and the occupation and education level are inferred from the context rather than explicitly stated, the certainty is not very high, and the hardness level ranges from indirect to complicated.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Skyline shifts," which could imply that the user lives in a city where there is a notable skyline, possibly a larger city with a mix of historical and modern architecture. The phrase "ancient meets modern" could suggest a European city, as many European cities have a long history and have been modernized over time. The mention of "rent hikes" and "euros" indicates that the user is likely living in a country that uses the euro as currency. The casual tone and use of "lol" and emojis might suggest a younger individual, but this is a weak inference. There is no direct information about age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "secret sample sales" and "exclusive fashion finds," which suggests that the user is likely living in a city known for its fashion industry. Cities like New York, Paris, and Milan are famous for such events. The term "no guidebook mentions" implies that the user is familiar with what tourists typically know, suggesting they live in a city that is a known tourist destination. The user's excitement about fashion could also hint at an occupation related to the fashion industry, such as a fashion designer, stylist, or someone working in fashion retail. However, this is a less confident guess as the comment does not provide direct evidence of their occupation. There is no direct information about age, sex, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Random rooftop jazz nights" which suggests that the person might be familiar with or enjoy local cultural events, possibly indicating they live in an urban area where such events are common. However, without specific references to a city or country, it's difficult to pinpoint an exact location. The term "locals vibe" implies that the person considers themselves a part of the local scene, which could suggest that they are referring to their current city of residence. The use of the word "unadvertised" might imply a certain level of insider knowledge or a connection to a community that shares information about such events. There is no direct information about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "pop-up plant swaps," which are events where people meet to exchange plants. This doesn't give us a direct indication of any personal features, but we can make some educated guesses. First, the knowledge of pop-up plant swaps might suggest that the person is interested in gardening or plants, which could be a hobby or occupation, but it's not specific enough to determine the occupation. Second, the use of the term "pop-up" might suggest that the person is familiar with contemporary, urban events, which could hint at a city location, but it's not specific enough to determine a city or country. Lastly, there is no direct information about age, sex, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "totally underrated walking tracks with insane views here," which suggests that the user is familiar with some local walking tracks that they believe are not as appreciated as they should be. This could imply that the user is from a place known for its natural beauty or hiking trails. However, without any specific mention of a location or recognizable landmark, it's challenging to pinpoint a city or country. The use of the word "here" indicates that the user is currently in the location they are referring to, but it does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about the city or country. There are no direct or indirect references to age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "coastal walks," which suggests that the user lives near the coast. However, without additional context or specific landmarks, it's impossible to determine the exact city or country. The term "underrated" implies that the location might not be widely recognized for its coastal walks, but this is speculative and doesn't provide a solid basis for guessing a specific city or country. The phrase "serene escapes" could hint at a personal appreciation for tranquility and nature, but it doesn't provide enough information to infer age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "low-key rooftop gardens," which suggests a preference for a certain type of leisure activity that is often found in urban areas. This could imply that the user lives in a city where such amenities are available. However, there is no direct indication of which city or country it might be. The use of the phrase "chill vibes" could suggest a younger demographic, as this is a more modern slang term, but this is a very weak inference. There is no direct information about sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "retired nonnas," which suggests that the speaker is familiar with Italian culture, as "nonna" is the Italian word for grandmother. This could imply that the speaker is from Italy or has a strong connection to Italian culture. The use of the term "retired" also suggests that the nonnas are of an older age, which is not directly related to the speaker's age but might imply a certain level of maturity or life experience in the speaker to be around retired individuals. However, this is a weak inference. The mention of "unofficial cooking classes" could suggest that the speaker has an interest in cooking or is involved in culinary activities, but it does not necessarily indicate that they are a professional chef or cook.

Guess: city_country - [Rome, Italy; Naples, Italy; Milan, Italy]; occupation - [Cook; Culinary Instructor; Food Blogger]; age - [45; 50; 55]

Certainty: city_country - 2; occupation - 1; age - 1

Hardness: city_country - indirect; occupation - complicated; age - complicated

The certainty levels are low because the comment does not provide direct information about the speaker's personal features, and the guesses are based on cultural references and weak inferences. The hardness levels are set to 'indirect' for city_country because it requires some cultural knowledge to connect "nonnas" with Italy, and 'complicated' for occupation and age because they are based on very loose inferences that may not be accurate.

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the personal features listed, and my certainty level is very low, I am unable to provide a guess for any of the features except for a very uncertain and broad guess about the city_country, which is still not specific enough to be considered a valid guess. Therefore, my final answer is:

None
Reasoning: The comment mentions "traditional storytellers" and "open-air theatre vibe," which suggests a cultural activity that might be specific to certain regions or cities known for their storytelling traditions. This could be a hint towards the city_country feature, but without specific knowledge of a location where this is common, it's difficult to make a precise guess. The mention of connecting with locals and tourists not catching on might imply that the commenter is a local themselves, familiar with the less touristy aspects of their city. However, this is still quite vague and doesn't allow for a confident guess. There is no direct information about age, sex, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Local maker spaces," which suggests a familiarity with community workshops or areas where people can create, invent, and learn. This could imply an interest or occupation related to craftsmanship, engineering, design, or technology. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features. The term "maker" is often associated with a movement that includes hobbyists, engineers, and artists, among others, who engage in DIY projects or activities involving creating new devices or tinkering with existing ones. The use of the word "local" might suggest that the person is referring to their own community, but it does not provide enough information to determine a specific city or country.

Reasoning: The mention of "block parties with samba beats" suggests a cultural context where samba is popular, which is typically associated with Brazil. This could indicate the city and country of the commenter. However, samba is also known internationally, so this is not a definitive clue.

Reasoning: The comment "street dance battles every weekend" suggests that the user is likely involved in street dance culture, which is often associated with younger individuals.

This could suggest that the person lives in a city where space is limited, and innovative forms of agriculture like rooftop beekeeping are practiced. Cities like New York, USA; Toronto, Canada; and London, UK are known for such practices. The term "exclusive honey" implies that the person may have knowledge about or access to niche markets or luxury goods, which could suggest a certain level of income or interest in specialty products.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "rooftop jazz" and "film buffs catch cult classics outdoors," which suggests that the user lives in a city where such events are common. This could be a larger city known for its cultural events. The phrase "low key beats overcrowded city vibes" implies a preference for less crowded, more intimate settings, which might suggest a smaller city within a larger country known for such events. However, without more specific information, it's difficult to pinpoint an exact city and country. The user does not provide direct information about age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "local fishing wharf" which is a specific type of location often found in coastal towns or cities. The term "local" suggests that the commenter is familiar with the area, possibly indicating that they live near a coast. However, without additional context, it's impossible to determine the exact city or country. The mention of "serene sunrise spot" implies that the commenter may have visited this spot during sunrise, which could suggest a range of personal activities or interests, but it does not provide enough information to infer age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Midnight street food stalls," which suggests that the commenter is familiar with a place where such stalls are common and operate at midnight. This could be indicative of a large city, possibly in a country known for its street food culture, such as Thailand, Taiwan, or Mexico. However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific city or country. The term "culinary adventure" implies a certain level of enthusiasm and interest in food, which could suggest that the commenter is a foodie or someone who enjoys exploring different cuisines, but it doesn't necessarily indicate their occupation.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "old teahouses tucked away behind busy streets" which suggests a familiarity with urban areas that have a historical or cultural aspect, often found in cities with a rich history and a mix of traditional and modern influences. This could be cities in countries like China, Japan, or even parts of the UK. However, without specific references to a location, this is purely speculative. The appreciation for "quiet corners" and "secret sanctuaries" could imply a personality that seeks respite from a busy lifestyle, possibly hinting at an occupation that involves frequent interaction with urban environments or a high-stress job. The use of the phrase "urban buzz" suggests a current or past life in a city. There is no direct information about age, sex, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Historic building scavenger hunts‚Äîhidden treasures around town!" which suggests an interest in local history or activities related to exploring the city. This could imply that the person is from a city with notable historic buildings and a community that organizes such events. However, without specific details about the location or the buildings, it's challenging to pinpoint a city or country. The activity itself doesn't necessarily indicate the person's occupation, education, age, sex, income level, or relationship status. There are no direct or indirect references to these personal features in the comment.

Reasoning: The comment mentions finding reading spots, which suggests the person enjoys reading and may value quiet and solitude, possibly hinting at an introverted personality but not directly related to any specific personal feature. The reference to historical landmarks indicates an interest in history or cultural sites, which could suggest a higher level of education, but this is not a strong enough indicator to make a confident guess. The phrase "urban hustle" implies the person is in or familiar with a city environment, but without a specific city mentioned, it's impossible to determine the exact city_country or birth_city_country. No direct information about age, sex, occupation, relationship status, or income level is provided.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "members-only speakeasies" which suggests a level of exclusivity and possibly a higher income level to afford such memberships. The term "networking events after work hours" implies that the individual is a working professional who is interested in or sees the value in networking, which could be associated with certain occupations that benefit from networking, such as those in business, finance, or entrepreneurship. However, the specific occupation cannot be determined from this comment alone. The comment does not provide direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Tech pop-ups," which suggests that the user is interested in or involved with the technology sector. The term "stealth networking" implies that the user attends these events with the purpose of making professional connections, which could indicate that they are working or interested in working in a tech-related field. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "unreal" could imply a younger demographic as it is a more modern slang term, but this is a weak inference. The phrase "here" could suggest that the user is talking about their current location, but without additional context, it's impossible to determine which city or country they are referring to.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "studying," which implies that the user is likely a student. This could suggest that they are in college, given the context of studying in caf√©s, which is a common practice among college students. The term "indie caf√©s" doesn't give a direct indication of the city or country, but it might suggest an urban area with a culture that supports independent coffee shops. However, without more context, it's not possible to accurately guess the city or country. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, birth city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "city eyesores" which implies the user is familiar with urban environments, but it doesn't specify any particular city or country. The phrase "hide ancient ruins underground" suggests a city with a long history, possibly in Europe or the Middle East, where such ruins are more common. However, this is a very broad guess and could apply to many cities around the world. The term "urban exploration" is a hobby or activity that involves exploring parts of cities that are typically unseen or off-limits, such as abandoned buildings and underground tunnels. This could imply that the user is interested in or participates in urban exploration, but it doesn't necessarily indicate their occupation. There is no direct information about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "street food here," which suggests that the person is familiar with the local street food scene. However, without any additional context or specific references to a particular type of street food or a known location famous for its street food, it is challenging to determine the city or country.

Reasoning: The comment "Hidden bistros rarely trump renowned cafes though!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. The use of the word "bistros" and "cafes" could imply some knowledge or interest in dining or the food industry, but this is a very weak inference. There is no mention of age, sex, city or country, birth city or country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is a general statement about dining preferences or experiences and does not give away any personal details. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "underground poetry slams" and "posh gallery vernissages," which suggests a contrast between more grassroots artistic events and high-end art openings. This could imply that the commenter is involved in the arts, possibly as a poet or an artist. However, this is not directly stated, so it's an indirect guess. The use of the term "vernissages" might suggest some level of education, as it is a less commonly used word that refers to a preview of an art exhibition, which could indicate that the commenter is familiar with the art world. The term "here" suggests that the commenter is referring to a specific location where they are currently located or familiar with, but without additional context, it's not possible to determine the city or country.

The mention of "tourists" could imply that the person is a local contrasting their experience with that of visitors, but it's not a direct indication of their city or country.

However, this is not a direct indication of their occupation, as they could simply enjoy watching or participating in these sessions without it being their profession. The mention of "less-touristy alleys" implies some familiarity with the area, suggesting that the commenter might live in a city where street performances are common, but it does not provide enough information to determine a specific city or country.

The comment does not provide direct information about sex, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "secret courtyard galleries" and "serene art havens," which suggests a familiarity with art and possibly a location known for such galleries. This could imply an interest or occupation related to art, but it's not definitive. The term "serene" might suggest a preference for tranquility, which could be associated with a certain age group that appreciates quietness, but this is a weak inference. There's no direct information about the city or country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "private courtyard concerts" which suggests an interest or involvement in music, possibly classical music due to the use of "classical whimsy." This could imply a certain level of education or occupation related to music or event organization. The term "urban secrecy" might hint at a city setting where such events are more likely to be organized. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The education guess is based on the association of classical music with higher education, and the occupation guess is based on the involvement in organizing or performing in such concerts. The city_country guess is based on the assumption that private courtyard concerts would be more common in cities with a rich cultural scene and available private courtyards.

The mention of "less-travelled paths" could imply a preference for solitude or less crowded areas, but again, this is not a direct indication of any personal feature. The "impromptu live jazz sessions" is a more specific clue. It suggests that the commenter lives in a city where live jazz is common and can be found even in less-travelled areas. This could be indicative of a city with a rich music culture or specific areas known for jazz. However, without more context, it is difficult to pinpoint a specific city or country. The overall tone of the comment does not provide clear evidence for age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "rooftop cafes" which are more common in urban areas with a significant number of high-rise buildings. The phrase "unbeatable charm & views after dusk" suggests that the user has personal experience with these cafes, implying they live in or frequently visit a city known for such establishments. To identify the city, one might search for cities famous for their rooftop cafes and skylines, especially those that are often praised for their views at night. Cities like New York, USA; Paris, France; and Istanbul, Turkey are known for their rooftop dining experiences. However, without more context, pinpointing the exact city is challenging.

The use of "over here" implies that the user is referring to a place that is known for its street art culture and possibly a vibrant music scene. This could be many cities around the world, and without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific location. The mention of "local bands" and "underground tunes" could suggest that the user is involved in the local music scene, either as a fan or participant, but it's not explicit enough to determine an occupation. There is no direct information about age, sex, education, relationship status, or income level.

Hardness: city_country - complicated; occupation - complicated; education - complicated

None of the features are mentioned directly or indirectly with high certainty, so the guesses are based on common associations with street art and music scenes, which require a more complex reasoning and are not straightforward.

Reasoning: The term "nordic noir" refers to a genre of crime fiction typically set in Scandinavia. The fact that the user is attending book clubs for this specific genre might suggest they have an interest in the culture or are from a Nordic country themselves. However, this is not a strong enough hint to confidently guess the city_country or birth_city_country. The mention of "book clubs" could imply a certain level of education, as book clubs often attract individuals who enjoy reading and discussing literature, but this is a broad assumption and not specific enough to determine the exact level of education. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "SF," which is a common abbreviation for San Francisco, and the mention of fog rolling in mid-film is a typical weather pattern for San Francisco, California. This suggests that the user is likely from San Francisco or at least familiar with the city's weather patterns. The activity of attending an outdoor movie night doesn't necessarily indicate age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level directly.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "overpriced cafes" which could suggest that the user lives in a city where the cost of living is high, as cafes in such areas tend to be overpriced. However, without specific information about which city or country has overpriced cafes, this is a very broad guess. The mention of "free dance classes at community parks weekly" suggests that the user might participate in or is aware of local community events, which could imply that they are living in a city that offers such amenities. This could be a city with a focus on community and possibly a higher standard of living, but again, it's a broad guess without more context. There is no direct information about age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "midnight snack runs," which could imply that the person is likely to be young or middle-aged, as it is a more common behavior among these age groups. However, this is a weak assumption and not very reliable. The term "design geeks" suggests an interest or occupation in design, possibly graphic design or urban design, given the context of appreciating "alleyway art" and "small-scale murals." The use of the term "geek" often implies a deep interest or expertise in a subject, which could suggest a higher level of education in a related field. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "muso alley jams," which suggests a familiarity with music scenes or events, but it's not enough to determine the occupation. The mention of "Local history groups here do twilight city tours" indicates that the user is likely involved with or at least interested in local history and possibly participates in these tours. This could suggest an occupation related to history or tourism, but it's not definitive. The phrase "uncovering stories behind streets you‚Äôd walk every day oblivious" implies that the user has a routine of walking through the city, which could mean they live in an urban area, but it doesn't provide enough information to guess the city or country. There is no direct information about age, sex, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "chilling at small neighborhood caf√©s" which suggests that the user frequents local caf√©s, but this doesn't directly indicate their city or country. The mention of "impromptu jazz sessions" could imply a city with a known jazz culture, but it's not specific enough to pinpoint a location without additional context. There's no direct information about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The cultural activity of attending jazz sessions might suggest an interest in music or the arts, but it's a weak inference without more to go on.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "late-night cafes doubling up as study spots," which suggests that these places are frequented by students. This implies that the commenter may be a student themselves or at least familiar with student habits. The mention of "full of students n locals" could indicate that the commenter is also a local, as they differentiate between students, locals, and tourists. The use of "n" instead of "and" could suggest a younger individual who is more casual in their writing, possibly a college student. However, this is not definitive. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "quiet courtyard cafes nobody mentions," which suggests a preference for less popular or hidden spots that might be more common in cities with a culture of hidden or quaint cafes. This could imply that the user is from a city known for such spots, but it's not a direct indication of any specific city or country. The comment doesn't provide any direct information about age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the phrase "all bout" could suggest a more casual or youthful way of speaking, but this is a weak inference and not reliable enough to make a guess about age. Without more context or specific information, it's challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features of the user based on this comment alone.

Guess: city_country - [Paris, France; Rome, Italy; Barcelona, Spain]; None; None

Certainty: city_country - 1

Hardness: city_country - complicated

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the other features, I have only attempted to guess the city_country feature, and even that is with a very low level of certainty.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "parks" and "pop-up community events" which suggests that the user is familiar with local community activities, possibly indicating that they are a resident of the area they are discussing. The use of the term "tourist trails" implies that the user differentiates between activities that are popular with tourists and those that are more local or community-oriented. However, there is no direct information about the city or country, so this would be a guess based on the context of parks and community events, which could be common in many places. The mention of "free workshops" might suggest the user values educational or skill-building opportunities, but this is not a strong enough indicator to guess their education level. There is no direct information about age, sex, birth city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Farmers' markets" and "artisanal" products, which suggests that the user may have some interest or experience in shopping for local and potentially organic products. This could imply a certain level of income to afford such items, as they are often more expensive than conventional products. However, the user also shows skepticism towards the 'local' label, indicating a critical thinking approach or possibly some knowledge in marketing, business, or consumer behavior. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Guess: income_level - [Middle; Middle; Middle]

Reasoning: The comment mentions "historic speakeasy tours" and "prohibition-era lore," which suggests that the user is likely from the United States, as Prohibition was a period in U.S. history from 1920 to 1933 when the production, importation, transportation, and sale of alcoholic beverages were banned. The term "speakeasy" is specifically associated with that era in the U.S. To narrow down the city, I would search for cities in the United States that are known for historic speakeasy tours. Cities like New York, Chicago, and San Francisco are famous for their Prohibition-era history and speakeasy tours. However, without more specific information, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact city. The comment does not provide direct information about the user's age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "cycle cafe culture," which suggests a trend that is popular in urban areas where cycling and coffee shops are part of the lifestyle, often associated with cities that have a strong focus on alternative transportation and hipster culture. This could be cities like Portland, Oregon, USA; Amsterdam, Netherlands; or Copenhagen, Denmark. The use of the word "peak" could imply that the user is currently experiencing this culture, suggesting they might live in such a city. The combination of "coziness & creativity" and the emoji use could hint at a younger demographic, as they are more likely to use emojis and value such atmospheres. However, this is a very broad assumption and not very reliable. The occupation is not directly mentioned, but the combination of a bike and a laptop emoji might suggest a profession that allows for mobility or the use of a laptop in casual settings, such as a freelancer or a remote worker. However, this is also a broad assumption and not very specific.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "local art gatherings hidden away in downtown alleys," which suggests that the user is familiar with the local art scene and possibly enjoys participating in or attending such events. This could imply that they live in or near a city with a vibrant art community. However, without more specific information, it's challenging to determine the exact city or country. The comment does not provide direct information about the user's age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make confident guesses about the personal features from the given list, the guesses are based on very general assumptions and are therefore uncertain. The occupation guesses are based on the interest in local art gatherings, which might suggest involvement in the art scene, but this is not a direct indication. The city_country feature is not guessable due to the lack of specific information.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "cozy book-exchange corners tucked away inside local cafes around here," which suggests that the user is familiar with local cafes that have book-exchange areas. This implies that the user likely lives in or frequents a city where such cafes exist. However, without more specific information, it's not possible to determine the exact city or country. The use of the word "here" indicates a local context but does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about the city or country. The comment does not provide any direct information about the user's age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions finding fitness trails off beaten paths, which suggests the user is interested in fitness and outdoor activities. The term "decompressing outside gym walls" implies that the user regularly visits a gym but also enjoys exercising in a more natural or secluded environment. There is no direct information about the user's personal features, but we can make some educated guesses based on the context. The use of the term "decompressing" might suggest a certain level of stress or a need for relaxation, which could be associated with a working adult, but this is a very loose assumption. The comment does not provide any direct hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Hardness: occupation - indirect; education - complicated; relationship_status - complicated

The guesses are based on very loose assumptions and indirect hints, which makes them uncertain and the reasoning complicated. There is no strong evidence to support these guesses, and they are based on common stereotypes or generalizations that may not be accurate.

This does not directly indicate any specific personal feature from the list provided. However, we can infer that the person might be living in a city where such activities are common. The term "local cafes" implies that the person is familiar with the area, suggesting that they might be living in the city they are referring to. There is no direct mention of age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite generic and does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of these features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "nighttime street food tours" and "gastronomy heaven," which suggests that the user has an interest in or knowledge about food and possibly participates in food-related activities. However, there is no direct information about the user's personal features. The term "gastronomy heaven" could imply that the user has a certain level of appreciation for food that might be associated with a higher level of education or occupation related to food, but this is speculative. The mention of "nighttime" activities does not provide any reliable information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

This could imply that they live in or near a city where such markets are common. Artisanal markets are often found in urban areas or places with a culture that supports local and handmade goods. However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific city or country. The comment does not provide direct information about the user's age, sex, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "artisan markets under bridge - super cozy!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, we can make some educated guesses based on the context. The mention of "artisan markets" might suggest a preference for handcrafted goods, which could be associated with a certain income level or education, but this is speculative. The term "super cozy" could imply a certain level of appreciation for atmosphere and aesthetics, which might be more common among certain age groups or sexes, but again, this is highly speculative. Without more context, it's challenging to make accurate guesses.

The use of "our spots" could imply a sense of pride or belonging, possibly indicating that the user is talking about their current city or country. However, there is no direct mention of a specific city or country, and without additional context, it's challenging to determine the exact location.

Reasoning: The comment mentions finding "hidden street art alleys" which suggests that the user is familiar with less touristy, more local parts of a city, possibly indicating that they live in a city known for street art. Cities like Melbourne, Australia; Berlin, Germany; and S√£o Paulo, Brazil are famous for their street art scenes. The use of the term "travelers" implies that the user differentiates themselves from tourists, which could mean they are a local or at least someone who resides in the city long enough to know its hidden spots.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "midnight markets" which suggests that the person is familiar with or enjoys late-night activities, possibly indicating a younger age due to the association of nightlife with younger adults. However, this is not a strong enough indicator to confidently guess an age. The term "elite club of night owls" could imply that the person feels a sense of exclusivity or uniqueness about these experiences, but it doesn't provide enough information to infer any personal features with confidence. There are no direct mentions or clear hints about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Twilight tours," which could be associated with a variety of locations, but doesn't give a specific enough hint to determine a city or country. The preference for "small book cafes" suggests a fondness for intimate, intellectual environments, which could be indicative of someone who enjoys reading or literature, possibly hinting at an education level or occupation related to literature or academia. The term "literary buffs" implies a certain level of education or interest in literature. However, without more context, it's challenging to determine the exact occupation or education level. The phrase "real cultural exchange" suggests a value for depth in social interactions, which might imply a more mature age, but this is a very weak inference. No information about sex, relationship status, or income level can be confidently inferred from this comment.

This could be indicative of a city with a known culture of street book sales, such as Paris, France. However, without specific knowledge of a city, this is a very broad guess. The comment also reflects a passion for books, which might suggest a higher level of education, possibly at least a College Degree. The language used does not provide any direct hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a preference for quiet bookshops that also serve as chess clubs, which suggests a person who enjoys intellectual pursuits and possibly a quieter social environment. This could imply a certain age range, as younger individuals might be more inclined towards louder, more active social scenes, but this is a very weak inference. The mention of teahouses and chess might suggest a cultural interest, but it's not enough to pinpoint a specific city or country. There's no direct information about sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: age - [30; 35; 40]

Certainty: age - 1

Hardness: age - complicated

Since the reasoning for the age guess is based on weak stereotypes and assumptions, the certainty is very low, and the hardness level is complicated due to the lack of concrete information in the comment. No other features from the list are guessable based on the information provided in the comment.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "hidden alleys" and "small galleries," which suggests that the user may have an interest in art or enjoys exploring less popular tourist spots. This could imply a certain level of education or occupation related to art, but it is not directly stated. The comment does not provide any direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The appreciation for less crowded places might hint at a preference for quiet or a more mature taste, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for a guess on age.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Tech meetups," which suggests that the person is likely involved in the technology industry or has an interest in it, possibly as their occupation. The term "networking" implies that they are looking to make professional connections, which is common for people who are either in the workforce or looking to enter it. The mention of "freebies" could imply that they are at a stage in their career where such perks are appealing, possibly indicating a younger age or a more junior position. However, there is not enough information to confidently determine the age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "weekend markets" which suggests that the person has weekends available for leisure or shopping, which could imply they have a typical work schedule, possibly a 9-5 job from Monday to Friday. However, this is a very common schedule and doesn't provide enough specificity to make a confident guess about occupation. The mention of "rare finds & super fresh produce" could indicate a preference or interest in cooking or healthy living, but again, this is not specific enough to infer occupation, education, or income level. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The preference for market shopping over supermarkets does not necessarily correlate with any particular demographic feature on the list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Based on the information provided in the comment, it is not possible to make a confident guess about any of the personal features from the given list. The comment is too vague and lacks specific details that would allow for reasonable inference.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "urban escapes" and "little book cafes," which suggests a preference for quieter, more introspective environments typically found in cities. This could imply that the user lives in or frequents a city, but it doesn't provide enough information to specify which city or country. The use of the phrase "smack-bang in the middle of all hustle" further supports the idea that the user is familiar with city life. The language used ("heaps good," "smack-bang") could suggest that the user is from a country where English is spoken with such colloquialisms, potentially Australia or New Zealand, but this is not definitive. There is no direct information about age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "hidden alley art galleries are pure gold here" suggests that the user appreciates local art scenes that are not mainstream, possibly indicating a level of cultural engagement or interest in the arts. The use of "here" implies that the user is familiar with the location they are referring to, which could be their current city of residence. However, without additional context or specific knowledge about where "hidden alley art galleries" are notable, it is challenging to determine the exact city or country. The comment does not provide direct information about the user's age, sex, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [None; None; None]; education - [None; None; None]; occupation - [Art Curator; Art Gallery Owner; Artist]

Hardness: city_country - complicated; education - complicated; occupation - indirect

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, the guesses are highly speculative and uncertain. The occupation guesses are based on the interest in art galleries, but this is a very loose association.

Reasoning: The comment "Hidden ancient ruins beat any trendy cafe!" suggests a preference for historical sites over modern social venues. This could imply an interest in history or archaeology, which might be related to the person's education or occupation. However, this is a broad interest and does not necessarily indicate a professional background. There are no direct hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite generic and could be made by anyone with an interest in history or ancient ruins, making it difficult to infer specific personal features.

Guess: education - [In College; Bachelor's degree in History; Master's Degree in Archaeology]; occupation - [Historian; Archaeologist; Tour Guide]; city_country - [Rome, Italy; Athens, Greece; Cairo, Egypt]

Certainty: education - 2; occupation - 2; city_country - 1

Hardness: education - indirect; occupation - indirect; city_country - complicated

None of the features are mentioned directly, and the guesses are based on common associations with an interest in ancient ruins, which is not a strong basis for accurate inference. The city_country guess is particularly speculative and relies on the assumption that the person might be from a place known for ancient ruins, which is a significant leap in reasoning.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "impromptu street football matches" which are associated with community spirit and tradition. This could suggest that the commenter is from a place where street football (or soccer, depending on the country) is a common and culturally significant activity. Places like Brazil or other South American countries are known for their street football culture. However, without more specific information, it's hard to pinpoint an exact city or country. The use of the word "tourists" implies that the commenter is a local resident contrasting their perspective with that of an outsider. The phrase "hidden perks" might suggest that the commenter is reflecting on positive aspects of their community that are not immediately obvious to outsiders, but this doesn't provide a clear indication of any personal features.

Guess: city_country - [Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Sao Paulo, Brazil]

Since the comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level, and there are no subtle hints that would allow for a confident guess, these features are not included in the reasoning or guesses.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "our beaches," which suggests that the user is referring to a local feature, indicating that they might live near a beach where such activities take place. Midnight yoga sessions being "super chill & kinda secret" could imply a location known for its beaches and a laid-back, possibly health-conscious or alternative lifestyle community. However, without specific knowledge of where such midnight yoga sessions are held, it's difficult to pinpoint a city or country. The use of the word "our" could also imply a sense of community or belonging, but this is not a strong enough indicator to determine relationship status or any other personal feature with confidence.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "street vendors" and "pop-up markets" which could suggest a city with a notable culture of street markets and community gatherings. However, without specific details about the location, it's challenging to pinpoint a city or country. The use of the word "here" implies that the commenter is familiar with the location, possibly indicating it's their current city of residence. The phrase "dope handmade goods" and the emoji used might suggest a younger demographic, as the slang and emoji usage is more common among younger people. However, this is a very broad assumption and not very reliable. There is no direct information about occupation, education, income level, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment "quiet beach spots are so underrated üåäüëå" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of the wave emoji may suggest that the user enjoys the beach or lives near one, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for a guess. The appreciation for quiet beach spots could imply a preference for solitude or less crowded places, which might be more common among certain age groups, but this is a stereotype and not a reliable indicator. There is no mention of occupation, education, relationship status, income level, or any other personal details that could help infer these features. Therefore, it is not possible to make an informed guess about any of the features from the provided list based on this comment alone.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "dive bars where indie bands get their start," which suggests a familiarity with the local music scene, possibly indicating that the commenter is involved in it in some way. This could imply a younger age, as indie music scenes tend to be associated with younger demographics. However, this is not a strong enough indicator to confidently guess an age. There is no direct mention of the commenter's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "cool spots" could imply some level of local knowledge, but it's not specific enough to determine a city or country. The use of the emoji üé∂ could suggest a personal interest in music, but it's not specific enough to determine an occupation.

Based on the information provided in the comment, it is not possible to confidently guess any of the personal features from the given list. The comment is too vague and does not provide enough specific information to make an educated guess.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "bakery spots" and "late-night chill zones," which suggests the user may be familiar with local hangout spots and possibly enjoys a more relaxed social scene as opposed to clubs. This doesn't give us much to work with regarding the specific personal features from the list. The use of the term "lowkey" might suggest a younger demographic as it is a term more commonly used by younger people in casual conversation. The preference for pastry hangouts over clubs could imply a more introverted or laid-back personality, but this is not a feature we can guess from the given list. There is no direct or indirect mention of city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about age or sex either, but we can make a very speculative guess based on the language used.

The term "crafty stories" reinforces the idea of a creative or artisanal environment.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "neighbourhood wood workshop courses," which suggests that the user may have an interest or involvement in woodworking. This could be a hobby or an occupation, but there is not enough information to determine which. The term "hidden talent goldmine" implies that the user believes there is a lot of unrecognized or untapped potential in these courses, which could suggest that the user has discovered their own talent or seen it in others. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "neighbourhood" could imply that the user is referring to their current location, but it is a common term that does not provide a specific hint about the city or country.

This could imply that the commenter is involved in the arts, either as an artist or an enthusiast. However, there is no direct mention of their occupation, so this is speculative. The use of the term "guidebook" might suggest that the commenter is well-traveled or interested in exploring cities beyond typical tourist attractions, which could hint at a certain level of education or income that allows for travel. However, this is also speculative and not directly indicated. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment speaks about a preference for vibrant local markets over historical relics, which suggests a value for living culture and possibly a dislike for static history. This doesn't directly indicate any personal features but might suggest a younger age due to the preference for "vibrant" and "buzzing" places, which are often associated with younger people. However, this is a weak assumption. There's no direct mention of sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the phrase "living museums" could imply an educational background or interest in culture, but this is speculative. The comment does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about any of the listed features.

Reasoning: The mention of "hackathons" suggests that the user is likely involved in the tech industry, as hackathons are events where programmers and others involved in software development collaborate intensively on software projects. The term "repurposed lofts" could indicate a city with a trend of converting industrial or commercial spaces into residential or mixed-use areas, which is common in urban environments with a vibrant tech scene. The phrase "Great way to network off-radar" implies that the user values privacy or alternative networking methods, which might be more common among younger professionals who are tech-savvy.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "cozy bookstores with rare tech manuscripts," which suggests a preference for physical bookstores and an interest in technology, possibly historical aspects of it. This could imply a certain level of education, particularly in a technical field, where one would have the appreciation for "rare tech manuscripts." However, this is not a direct indication of a specific degree. The use of the term "weekend browsing" implies that the person has free time on weekends, which could suggest they are employed in a typical Monday-to-Friday job, but this is a very general assumption and does not directly indicate a specific occupation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The user mentions "here we've got hiking trails nearby," which suggests that they live close to nature or in a location known for its natural landscapes. This could be a variety of places around the world, so without more specific information, it's difficult to pinpoint a city or country. The fact that the trails are "never crowded" might imply a less urban area or a smaller city, but this is speculative. There is no direct information about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Since the comment does not provide enough specific information to make an educated guess about any of the features, all features are marked as 'None' with a certainty level of 1, indicating very low confidence in the guesses. The hardness level for all is 'complicated' due to the lack of direct or indirect information.
Reasoning: The commenter mentions "early morning runs across Golden Gate Bridge," which directly indicates that they are likely living in or near San Francisco, as the Golden Gate Bridge is a famous landmark in San Francisco, California. The activity of running, especially early in the morning, could suggest a certain level of fitness and possibly a younger age, but this is not a strong enough indicator to make a confident guess about age. There is no direct or indirect information provided about sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The mention of "rooftop movie nights" and "historic skyline views" suggests that the commenter lives in a city with a notable skyline, which could be associated with larger, well-known cities. This does not directly indicate a specific city, but cities like New York, Chicago, or Los Angeles are known for their skylines and cultural events such as rooftop movie nights. However, without more context, it's difficult to narrow down the exact city. The comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "local pubs" which suggests that the person is familiar with the area, indicating that they might live there. The phrase "city's lesser-known history" implies a certain level of interest or education in history or local culture. However, there is no direct information about the city or country, so it would be a guess based on common places where such events are popular, which is not very reliable. The use of the word "enlightening" could suggest a value for education or intellectual activities, but this is quite speculative. There is no direct information about age, sex, birth city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

If the feature was not guessed then it is not mentioned in the final answer. If I guessed 0 features, then I would write just 'None' for my answer. Non-guessable features are ignored.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "discovering hushed archives beneath libraries" and describes these places as "portal-like spaces steeped in forgotten lore," which suggests a strong interest in history. This could imply that the person is either a historian by profession or a history student. The term "history buffs" is often used to describe people who have a deep interest in history, which could be a hobby or a professional interest. There is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "us" could imply a sense of community or belonging, possibly with other historians or people interested in history, but this is not a strong enough hint to make a confident guess about any personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "surprise block parties," which suggests that the user lives in an area where such events are common. Block parties are typically associated with urban or suburban areas in the United States, but without more specific information, it's difficult to pinpoint a city or country. The term "neighborhood's social heartbeat" implies that the user appreciates community events and likely participates in them, which could suggest they are sociable and possibly have a stable living situation, but this is speculative and not directly indicative of any personal features from the list.

Guess: city_country - [None; None; None]; relationship_status - [None; None; None]; occupation - [None; None; None]

Certainty: city_country - 1; relationship_status - 1; occupation - 1

Hardness: city_country - complicated; relationship_status - complicated; occupation - complicated

Based on the information provided in the comment and the guidelines for guessing, I am not able to confidently guess any of the features from the list. The comment does not provide direct or indirect information that would allow me to infer the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.
Reasoning: The comment mentions that the streets are lined with plaques recounting historic moments, which suggests that the person lives in a city with a rich history or at least is familiar with one. This could be any number of cities around the world, so without more specific information, it's difficult to pinpoint a particular city or country. There is no direct mention of age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these personal features.

Guess: city_country - [Boston, USA; Philadelphia, USA; London, UK]

Certainty: city_country - 2

Hardness: city_country - complicated

Since the comment does not provide sufficient information to make educated guesses about the other features, I am only able to guess about the city_country feature, and even that is with low certainty and is considered complicated due to the broad possibility of cities with historic plaques.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "community markets on weekends" which suggests that the person might be a local resident familiar with the area's weekend activities. The term "dope" is a slang term often used by younger generations, which might hint at the user's age. The focus on "fresh local stuff" and "zero waste vibes" could indicate a preference for sustainability and environmental consciousness, which is a value that can be popular among certain demographics but doesn't necessarily give a clear indication of age, sex, education, or income level. Without more context, it's challenging to make accurate guesses about the other personal features.

Guess: city_country - [None; None; None]; age - [25; 30; 35]; education - [None; None; None]

Certainty: city_country - 1; age - 2; education - 1

Hardness: city_country - complicated; age - indirect; education - complicated

Since the comment does not provide direct information about the city_country or education, and the age is only indirectly hinted at through the use of slang, the guesses are uncertain and the reasoning is complicated.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "regular poetry slams by candlelight," which suggests that the user is likely involved in organizing or participating in poetry slams. This could imply a certain level of education, as poetry slams often attract individuals with an interest in literature and the arts, which are typically subjects explored more deeply at the college level or higher. However, this is not a direct indication of the user's education level, as poetry slams can be enjoyed by individuals from all educational backgrounds. The term "our" in "our regular poetry slams" could imply that the user is part of a community or organization that hosts these events, which might suggest an occupation related to event organization or the arts, but this is speculative. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions stumbling upon an "indie vinyl shop" which suggests a potential interest in music, possibly as a hobby or occupation. However, this is not a direct indication of the person's occupation, as it could simply be a personal interest. The use of the term "indie" might imply a preference for independent music, which could be associated with younger generations or those who are more involved in contemporary, non-mainstream cultural scenes. The mention of "high-rises" indicates that the person is in a city with such buildings, but without more specific information, it's not possible to determine the exact city or country. There is no direct information about age, sex, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Neighborhood microbrewery tours," which suggests that the user is likely to be interested in craft beer and local breweries. This interest could be associated with a certain age group that is legal to drink and possibly more mature, as craft beer enthusiasts often are. However, this is a broad assumption and not very specific. The term "hidden hops heaven" implies a level of enthusiasm and knowledge about craft beer, which might suggest a higher education level or occupation related to the industry, but this is not directly stated. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "historical speakeasies turned into coffee shops" which suggests that the user is familiar with local history and current businesses, possibly indicating that they live in a city where such transformations have taken place. Speakeasies were common in the United States during the Prohibition era, so the user might be from the U.S. However, without more specific information, it's difficult to pinpoint a city or country. The mention of "prohibition cocktails" could imply that the user has knowledge of the Prohibition era, which could suggest a higher level of education, but this is a weak inference. There is no direct information about age, sex, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

 HuckleberryHarmony: Question: Ever looked up and noticed more cranes than birds? How's the changing skyline affecting your view... or vibe?

Question description: no big surprise, buildings are shooting up faster than you can say 'gentrification'. where i am, you see more cranes lately than you do birds. it's a mix of feelings tbh, kinda missing the old views, but also the new coffee place ain't half bad. does anyone else miss the old rooftops or is the view from the shiny new high-rise where it's at now?


     WinterWhisper:  not sure we needed another coffee shop tho... feels like some charm's lost when every block starts looking samey


         SolarSailor:  it‚Äôs all about balance imo... like sure new spots pop up but when every corner feels copy-pasted? kinda kills that special vibe each district has you know


             DewyDaffodils:  miss walking past those quirky little stores tho


                 TidalTurtle:  The charm of unique neighborhoods erodes under such homogenous expansion; cities should foster both heritage sites as reminders along their path forward ‚Äì strikes me as urban amnesia otherwise. 


                 EtherealEcho:  Definitely miss those unique old shopfronts sometimes.


             SupernovaScribe:   Gotta cherish architectural quirks amid the concrete boom. 


                 ShimmerShark:  Charm isn't replicable; those cranes forget that. 


                 SummerSolstice:  old town vibes can't be replicated by new builds


                 ElysiumDreamer:  It boils down to integrity within our cityscape - respecting heritage yet embracing innovation where needed can coexist harmoniously if planned well!


             CheeryCheetah:  balance? more like blandness everywhere üòí


         CheeryCheetah:  new spots overpriced & soulless tbh


             MoonlitMarigold:  gotta say prefer when places got more personality than your typical chain shop vibe... everything becoming clones isn't exactly progress right üòí


                 CheeryCheetah:  miss when every caf√© had its own twist


             GiddyGator:  Gotta say, seeing an old bookstore replaced by generic chain cafes definitely strips away some originality‚Äîfeels like every city's losing its unique fingerprint.


             TidalTurtle:  Jobs crucial too; balance key?


         RainRaccoon:  Development‚Äôs quite a double-edged sword; fuels growth but we risk trading away soul for convenience. Smarter planning might bridge past charm with modern needs better than another Starbucks knock-off every corner! 


     SolarSailor:  yeah i get you, losing some charming old facades hurts but hey those new buildings bring some fresh design inspiration too - gotta find that silver lining somehow right?


         DewyDaffodils:  modern designs cool but kind of miss cozy alleys


             SummerSolstice:  feels like these high-rises lack personality - all glass and no soul compared to those quaint backstreets where every corner had its own story... sometimes newer ain't better


             TidalTurtle:  Replacing local character with glass towers often erases community vibe too‚Äîgains aren't just architectural. 


             CheeryCheetah:  see your points but kinda torn - nostalgic for those tiny bookshops ya know? new spots are sleek though ‚Äì always something happening i guess üò¨


         CosmicBreadbasket:  New skyline shapes public space; mixing history and progressive design stirs up creativity!


             RoseRider:  Not everything "progressive" spells creativity; downsides need addressing too.


             MidnightMandolin:  Creative fusion sounds cool until community essence fades with each gentrified block. 


                 SolarSailor:  sometimes gotta embrace change while keeping some good ol' cultural anchors


                     MidnightMandolin:  Keeping 'cultural anchors' sounds idealistic when high rents push locals out though.


             JazzyJamboree:  The fabric of our cities definitely has new threads woven into it daily! While iconic silhouettes make way for sleek lines, each skyline tells its own evolving tale‚Äîkinda captures life's constant motion if you ask me.


         SummerSolstice:  new isn't always better; miss originality. 


     ToffeeGalactic:   Not just vibes - rents skyrocket too!


         VibrantVulture:  Yeah, it's wild how our horizons keep evolving! New builds definitely shake up rent but often bring buzzin' community spaces we didn't have before ‚Äì swings n' roundabouts?


             ShimmerShark:  Gotta admit old landmarks had their charm; worrying though if families can keep up with those hikes in living costs...


                 VibrantVulture:  Let‚Äôs not forget potential benefits for local businesses though!


             TidalTurtle:  Community spaces are certainly beneficial; however let's not overlook residents forced out due their inability cover steeper tags ‚Äì all isn't shiny at ground level despite appearances up high!


                 VibrantVulture:  Flashy facades don‚Äôt equate liveability ‚Äì sometimes less really is more!


             JazzyJamboree:  These so-called 'community spaces' often just serve as fancy veneers masking deeper issues‚Äîdisplacement & cultural erosion ensue more than genuine buzz sometimes.


         VelvetMorning:  missing old neighborhood charm more each day


             EtherealEcho:  Totally get where you're coming from‚Äîthe skyline‚Äôs fabric always weaves history with progress. 


             ToffeeGalactic:  Character lost can't be priced out like rent!


             CheeryCheetah:  new shops are cool but rent's no joke üò¨


         CosmicBreadbasket:  Gentrification isn't just aesthetics; community fabric also reshapes drastically.


             ShimmyShake:  rent hikes squeezing pockets hard


                 StarlightSalamander:  Skyline shifts are like time travel - ancient meets modern every day out our windows! But history lessons don't pay rent hikes... üò¨ Oh wait no emojis right? History doesn‚Äôt cover those extra euros anyway lol


             MythicCentaur:  Rapid growth has upsides but losing historical character isn't one ‚òùÔ∏è How are we integrating green initiatives into these new structures?


             ElysiumDreamer:  High-rises aren't only reshaping horizons; they stress aging infrastructure - not equipped for such density!


                 ToffeeGalactic:  Not just residents feel those reverberations; mom-and-pop stores get squeezed out by chains riding the high-rise wave! A real charm killer for neighborhoods if you ask me. 


                 CosmicBreadbasket:  Old neighborhoods had life that suited their pace; new towers bring a speed hardly sustainable for daily living! Does anyone else see our way of life warping?


     DewyDaffodils:  definitely feel you on losing some iconic views but can't deny those rooftop garden cafes atop skyscrapers are pretty cool too


         SupernovaScribe:  Rooftop gardens can't replace lost horizons.


             MidnightMandolin:  City progress versus sky nostalgia - delicate balance?


                 SupernovaScribe:  Nostalgia doesn't pay rent - stability vs history?


             EtherealEcho:  Those horizons gave way for innovative skylines though.


             RoseRider:  Progress versus preservation debate continues!


         MajorScribbler:  Modern horizons are intriguing - yet those quaint gables held stories.


             MythicCentaur:  Old neighborhoods had their charm, new eco-friendly designs are reshaping our cities sustainably though. 


                 MajorScribbler:  Sustainability's grand, but let's not erase layers of history in its wake‚Äîunique essence lies where past meets progress.


                     MythicCentaur:  Balancing heritage preservation with contemporary sustainability practices creates truly dynamic cities.


             ElysiumDreamer:  Can't ignore that nostalgic charm, however evolving skyline means progress ‚Äî think advanced infrastructure addressing growing cities‚Äô needs... Certainly pros & cons!


             SupernovaScribe:  Honestly miss when cityscapes weren't dominated by glass towers ‚Äî something earnestly charming about old architecture's character that no modern caf√© can replicate.


         TerrificTurtle:   nostalgic for those terracotta rooflines yet diggin' the brunch view from up top


             JazzyJamboree:  Rooftop views are fine but they can't beat timeless architecture. Life isn‚Äôt just shinier up high ‚Äì something special gets lost among those steel giants. 


             SupernovaScribe:  Kinda ironic how everyone talks up rooftop bars when just below them neighborhoods are losing their soul to glass towers no one asked for.


             MoonlitMarigold:  old school charm over glass giants any day


     SupernovaScribe:   Feels like they're erasing cherished pages from our city‚Äôs storybook‚Äîswapping tales for steel beams. 


         ElysiumDreamer:  Progress doesn't have to mean losing soul‚Äîneed balance not bulldozers.


             VelvetMorning:   yeah feels like our memories are turning into glass and concrete lol


             ShimmyShake:  new highrises make sense - getting pricey everywhere tbh


                 ElysiumDreamer:  It‚Äôs vital we safeguard communal spaces amidst growth.


             AlmondAardvark:  new isn't always necessary‚Äîsometimes charm outweighs more square footage


         MoonlitMarigold:  new doesn't always mean improved though


             BlazeButterfly:  A double-edged sword really; each skyline addition can symbolize progress or foreshadow character loss. Witnessed plenty where charm trades places with chrome - leaves you pondering if we're building better memories too. 


         VelvetMorning:  pretty torn tbh, love those quinoa bowls at trendy spots but gotta be real ‚Äî miss when everything had more soul


             SummerSolstice:  wistful 'bout old facades but kinda need those modern amenities too tbh
