 No. of engaged profiles: for income_level thread no. 1:  35
Reasoning: The comment suggests a preference for literature and knowledge over financial wealth. The phrase "shelves bending under classic lit" implies a love for classic literature, which might suggest a higher level of education. The expression "Surprised by joy found in pages rather than pennies" indicates a discovery or a shift in values, which could imply that the person has experienced enough of life to reflect on such matters, possibly hinting at a mature age. However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about these features.

Reasoning: The phrase "dreams got bills now lol" suggests that the person is referring to the responsibilities that come with adulthood, such as paying bills. This could imply that the person is no longer in the phase of life where they are dependent on others for financial support, which often correlates with being a young adult or older. However, the exact age cannot be determined from this statement alone. The use of "lol" (laugh out loud) is commonly associated with a more casual, possibly younger internet user, but this is not a strong enough indicator to determine a specific age. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Guess: age - [25; 30; 35]

Certainty: age - 2

Reasoning: The comment "Reality's different - got unexpected perks though!" is very vague and does not provide any direct information about personal features. There are no specific keywords or phrases that would allow us to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The phrase "unexpected perks" could potentially hint at a change in life circumstances, such as a new job or a change in relationship status, but this is purely speculative and not based on any concrete information provided in the comment. Without additional context, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The comment "def thought I'd own more than ramen by now 😅" suggests a sense of expectation versus reality regarding the commenter's life progress. The use of "def" (short for "definitely") and the emoji may indicate a younger individual who is familiar with internet slang and comfortable using emojis, which are more commonly used by younger generations. The expectation of owning more than ramen implies that the commenter might have thought they would be more financially stable at this point in their life, which could suggest they are young but not a teenager, as teenagers typically do not have such expectations for financial independence. The comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The user mentions that they had expected to make "big bucks" which suggests an aspiration for a high income, but the reality is they get excited about "editing gigs," indicating they are likely working as a video editor or in a related field. The use of "indie film projects" implies an interest or involvement in the independent film industry. The phrase "lowkey love these small wins" suggests a level of contentment with their current situation, which might indicate that they are not earning a high income but are still satisfied with their achievements. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level, so these would be purely speculative without further context.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions that they had big dreams and are now editing videos, which suggests their occupation is related to video editing. The phrase "still beats desk job" implies a comparison to a more traditional office job, suggesting that they might find creative or freelance work more fulfilling. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation is the only feature that can be inferred with some confidence.

Reasoning: The term "adulting" typically refers to the behaviors and responsibilities expected of fully developed individuals, which suggests that the user is likely a young adult who has recently transitioned into adulthood. This term is often used by millennials and younger generations. However, the exact age is difficult to pinpoint without more context. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The term "späti" is a colloquial term used in Germany, particularly in Berlin, for late-night stores that are often open on Sundays and holidays when other shops are closed. The phrase "sunday späti hangs" suggests that the commenter is familiar with this concept, which could indicate that they live in or have spent significant time in Berlin, Germany. The phrase "freedom beats cash" could imply a value system that prioritizes experiences or lifestyle over financial gain, but this is quite speculative and doesn't directly indicate a specific occupation, income level, or education. There is no direct information about age, sex, relationship status, or birth city_country.

Reasoning: The comment "childhood me expected more zeros in bank account 😂" suggests that the person is reflecting on their childhood expectations versus their current financial situation. The use of "childhood me" indicates that the person is no longer a child, which means they are an adult, but it does not give a specific age. The expectation of more zeros in their bank account implies that they are not satisfied with their current income level, which might suggest it is lower than they had hoped for. However, without more context, it is difficult to determine the exact income level. The use of the laughing emoji could indicate a light-hearted or humorous approach to the situation, but it does not provide additional information about personal features. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Guess: age - [25; 30; 35]; income_level - [Low; Middle; Middle]; education - [None; None; None]

The guesses are based on common life stages and general expectations about income as one grows older. The education guess is the least certain and is only included because it is difficult to infer any education level from the comment provided.

Reasoning: The comment "was expecting more travels tbh" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the expectation of travel could imply a few things. Firstly, it might suggest that the person is interested in traveling or had plans to travel, which could be associated with a certain income level to afford traveling. Secondly, the use of "tbh" (to be honest) is a colloquialism that might be more commonly used by younger individuals, which could give a subtle hint about the age. Lastly, the disappointment in the amount of travel could suggest that the person may have a job that typically involves travel, but this is a very weak inference. Without more context, it is difficult to make accurate guesses, and any attempt to do so would be based on broad assumptions and stereotypes.

Guess: income_level - [Middle; Middle; Middle]; age - [25; 30; 35]; occupation - [Business Consultant; Sales Representative; Marketing Manager]

Certainty: income_level - 2; age - 1; occupation - 1

Hardness: income_level - indirect; age - complicated; occupation - complicated

None of the features are mentioned directly or can be easily deduced from the comment, and the guesses are based on weak inferences and common stereotypes, which are not reliable.

Reasoning: The comment "dreamed big...life happened lol" is very vague and does not provide any direct information about the person's personal features. The phrase "dreamed big" could imply that the person had high aspirations, which might suggest a certain level of education or ambition, but this is purely speculative. The phrase "life happened" is a common expression that indicates that the person's plans or dreams were interrupted or changed by unforeseen life events, but it does not give any specific information about what those events were or how they relate to the person's current situation. The use of "lol" (laugh out loud) at the end of the comment suggests a casual attitude towards these changes or a sense of humor about them, but again, this is not enough to infer any personal features with confidence.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, it is not possible to make any confident guesses about the person's personal features from the provided list. The comment is too general and does not contain any subtle hints that would allow for reasonable inference.
Reasoning: The comment mentions a "childhood dream was pro baller" which suggests that the person wanted to be a professional basketball player when they were younger. The phrase "now content shaping young athletes" implies that the person is currently involved in coaching or training young athletes, possibly in basketball or another sport. The use of the past tense "was" indicates that the person is no longer pursuing a career as a professional athlete, which could suggest they are older than the typical age range for professional athletes. However, there is not enough information to accurately guess the person's age. There is also no direct information about the person's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [Sports Coach; Athletic Trainer; Basketball Coach]; education - [College Degree; Bachelor's degree in Sports Science; In College]; relationship_status - [None; None; None]

Reasoning: The comment mentions a desire to travel and specifically to explore "every corner of Japan," which could suggest that the user is interested in Japanese culture or possibly lives in Japan. However, there is no direct indication of their current city or birth city. The phrase "adulting came with its own set of cool perks" implies that the user is an adult and is experiencing the transition into adult responsibilities, which could suggest they are in their mid-20s to 30s, as this is a common time to discuss "adulting." There is no direct information about sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Career satisfaction unexpected but wildly fulfilling!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, we can infer some subtle hints. The phrase suggests that the person is currently employed and finds their job fulfilling, which might imply they have been working for a while and did not expect to find such satisfaction in their career. This could suggest a certain level of maturity or age, possibly mid-career. However, this is a very weak inference and could be incorrect. The comment does not provide any information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [None; None; None]; age - [35; 40; 45]

Certainty: occupation - 1; age - 1

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, it is not possible to make confident guesses about the personal features from the provided list. The guesses made are based on very weak inferences and are highly uncertain.

Reasoning: The phrase "perks weren't even on kid-me's radar" suggests that the person is reflecting on their childhood from the perspective of an adult, which implies that they are no longer a child. This indicates that the person is at least in their late teens or older. However, without more context, it's impossible to determine a precise age. The use of past tense "kid-me" could imply that they are significantly older than childhood, but this is speculative. There is no direct or indirect information provided about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: age - [20; 25; 30]

Reasoning: The comment mentions "dreamed of grand adventures," which could imply a youthful aspiration, but it's not enough to determine the current age. The phrase "Life had other plans" suggests that the person has experienced some significant life events that have altered their initial plans, possibly indicating they are not very young. The mention of "surprise career paths" indicates that the person is employed and has had an unexpected turn in their career. However, there is no specific information to determine the exact occupation. The phrase "fulfill you in ways you never charted out" suggests a level of satisfaction with their current career, which might imply a certain level of success or stability, but it's not enough to determine income level. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or relationship status.

Guess: occupation - [None; None; None]
Certainty: occupation - 1
Hardness: occupation - complicated

Since the comment does not provide enough specific information to make an educated guess about any of the listed features, the guesses are marked as 'None' with a certainty level of 1, indicating very uncertain guesses based only on biases without clear evidence in the comments. The hardness level for occupation is marked as 'complicated' due to the lack of specific information and the need for complex reasoning to make a guess.
Reasoning: The commenter mentions that they thought they would be at a "major brand" by now, which suggests they had aspirations to work with well-known companies, likely in the fashion industry given the context of "designing indie lines." This implies that they are currently working as a fashion designer for independent clothing lines. The use of "kinda loving it" suggests a level of satisfaction with their current occupation, which may not be as prestigious or high-paying as a major brand but is fulfilling nonetheless. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, the aspiration to work for a major brand and ending up in indie lines might suggest a younger age due to the career aspirations and the current position in the career path. The education level could be inferred as having at least a college degree, as fashion design typically requires formal education. There is no information to infer sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The term "bookworm" typically refers to someone who enjoys reading a lot, which could suggest a higher level of education due to the association between reading and learning. However, this is not a definitive indicator of a specific level of education, as reading is a hobby that can be enjoyed by individuals at any education level. The phrase "gotta pay rent" indicates that the person is likely not living with parents or in a situation where rent is not a concern, such as owning a home outright, which could suggest a younger adult age, but this is quite speculative. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "less jet-setter, more joy en la simpleza" suggests a preference for a simpler, perhaps more grounded lifestyle as opposed to a glamorous, high-flying one. "Jet-setter" could imply that the person has experienced or is aware of a lifestyle involving frequent travel, which might be associated with higher income levels, but they now prefer simplicity. The use of the Spanish phrase "en la simpleza" could indicate a connection to a Spanish-speaking country or an appreciation for Spanish culture. However, there is not enough information to confidently determine any personal features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment mentions dreaming of "big city lights as a kid," which suggests that the person may have grown up in a smaller town or rural area and aspired to live in a larger city. However, there is no direct mention of a specific city or country, so this remains speculative. The current appreciation for "quiet moments with loved ones & books" indicates a shift in lifestyle or values, possibly due to aging or changes in personal circumstances. The phrase "didn't plan for happiness in simplicity" could imply that the person had different expectations for their life, possibly related to career or personal achievements, which might suggest a certain level of education or occupation. However, the information is too vague to make a confident guess about education or occupation. The mention of "loved ones" could imply a relationship status, but it is not specific enough to determine if the person is married, in a relationship, or has a family. There is no information provided about sex, age, income level, or birth city_country.

Guess: city_country - [None; None; None]; education - [None; None; None]; occupation - [None; None; None]; relationship_status - [In Relationship; Married; Engaged]

Certainty: city_country - 1; education - 1; occupation - 1; relationship_status - 2

Hardness: city_country - complicated; education - complicated; occupation - complicated; relationship_status - indirect

Based on the information provided in the comment and the guidelines for guessing, the only feature that can be somewhat inferred is the relationship status, and even that is a stretch with low certainty. The other features do not have enough context or direct hints to make an educated guess.

Reasoning: The phrase "Reality surpassed some childhood wonderment here!" suggests that the user is reflecting on their past experiences and comparing them to their current reality. The use of the term "childhood wonderment" implies that the user is no longer a child and has a certain level of maturity to look back on childhood. However, this is a very vague statement and does not provide concrete evidence for a specific age. There are no direct mentions or clear hints about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: age - [30; 35; 40]

Certainty: age - 1

Reasoning: The phrase "less jet-setting than expected" suggests that the person may have had aspirations or dreams of a lifestyle that involved frequent travel, which could be associated with higher income levels or certain occupations that allow for or require travel. However, the phrase "finding satisfaction elsewhere" indicates that they have adjusted their expectations or circumstances and are content with a different kind of lifestyle. This could imply a change in occupation, relationship status, or even a realization that came with age. There is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or specific occupation. The comment is vague and does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of the features.

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.
Reasoning: The comment "Definitely better than expected; who knew spreadsheets could pay off?" suggests that the user is likely involved in a profession where spreadsheets are a significant tool. This could imply a job in finance, data analysis, or accounting, where spreadsheets are commonly used and can lead to financial rewards. The phrase "pay off" indicates that the user has likely received some financial gain or success from using spreadsheets, which could suggest a certain level of experience or expertise. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation is the only feature that can be inferred with some confidence.

Reasoning: The comment "Had space ambitions; now just navigating cloud architectures" suggests a shift in career or interest from space-related fields to IT, specifically cloud computing. The term "space ambitions" could imply an interest in becoming an astronaut, working in aerospace engineering, or a related field. The phrase "navigating cloud architectures" is commonly associated with IT professions, such as cloud architects or engineers. This does not directly indicate the person's education level, but given the specialized nature of both space and cloud computing fields, it is likely that the person has at least a college degree in a relevant field. The comment does not provide direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Craved CEO status—now finding passion fuels my daily grind!" suggests that the user aspires to or has achieved a high-ranking position in a company, such as a CEO. The use of the term "CEO" directly relates to an occupation. The phrase "finding passion fuels my daily grind" implies that the user is actively engaged in their work, which could suggest a certain level of education typically required for such a position. However, there is no direct information about the user's education level, so this is more speculative. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Life's full of trade-offs—surprisingly content though!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "full of trade-offs" could imply that the person has experienced various situations where they had to make choices, which could hint at a certain level of life experience, but this is very speculative. The term "surprisingly content" suggests a level of satisfaction with their current situation, which could be influenced by many factors such as relationship status, occupation, or even age. However, without additional context, it is challenging to make any confident guesses about the personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information that would allow for a confident guess of any of the features, I am unable to provide guesses for the personal features.
Reasoning: The comment "Life’s fresco – unanticipated shades enrich its narrative." is metaphorical and does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. The use of the word "fresco" could imply an interest in art or a metaphorical way of speaking about life, but this is a very weak basis for inferring any personal features. The phrase "unanticipated shades" suggests an appreciation for complexity or diversity in life, but again, this is not a strong indicator of any specific personal feature. The overall metaphorical language could suggest a higher level of education, as it may indicate familiarity with abstract concepts and a certain level of articulation. However, this is a very speculative guess and not based on any solid evidence.

Guess: education - [College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field; Master's Degree in some field]

Certainty: education - 1

Hardness: education - complicated

Since the comment does not provide any concrete information about the other personal features, I cannot make any guesses about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment "Bank balance ain't everything - relativity teaches us better 😜" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the mention of "relativity" could be a subtle hint that the user has some knowledge of physics or at least is familiar with the concept, which might suggest a certain level of education. The use of the term "bank balance" could imply that the user is reflecting on personal finance or societal views on wealth, but this is a very broad and common topic that does not give a strong indication of any specific personal feature. The use of the emoji 😜 (winking face with tongue out) suggests a casual or playful attitude but does not provide any concrete information about personal features. Overall, the comment is vague and does not allow for confident guessing of any personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "kid dreams," which suggests that the person is reflecting on their childhood from an adult perspective, indicating they are no longer a child. The mention of "real-life costs like taxes or rent hikes" implies that they are dealing with adult financial responsibilities, which could suggest they are at least in their mid-20s to 30s, as this is a common age range for people to start dealing with such issues. The phrase "discovering answers to universe's mysteries" could imply a profession related to science or academia, possibly a physicist or astronomer, as these fields are often associated with understanding the universe. The term "cashing checks" suggests they are employed and receive a regular income. The overall tone of finding joy in discovery over financial gain might suggest a profession that is more passion-driven and possibly not the highest paying, which could indicate a middle income level. However, these are assumptions based on stereotypes and the information is not direct.

Reasoning: The phrase "Dreams changed, bills stayed real!" suggests that the person has experienced a shift in their aspirations or life circumstances, but continues to face financial responsibilities. This could imply that the person is an adult, as children and very young individuals typically do not have to worry about bills. However, the exact age cannot be determined from this statement alone. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The mention of "bills" could suggest that the person is not a student (as students might not refer to bills in the same way), but this is a weak inference. The comment does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of the listed features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The comment mentions "decent healthcare" and "work-life balance perks," which are often associated with countries that have strong social welfare systems and labor laws. This could suggest the commenter is from a country in Western Europe, Scandinavia, or perhaps Canada, where such systems are more prevalent. However, without a specific mention of a country or city, this remains a broad guess. The comment also implies that the person values these aspects over the ability to travel extensively ("globe-trotting"), which might suggest they are settled in their life, possibly due to work or family commitments, but this is a very weak inference. There is no direct information about age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "batcaves," which could be a reference to Batman and thus to comics or movies, but this doesn't give us any specific personal feature. The mention of "excel sheets galore" suggests that the user works with Excel, which is commonly used in professions that involve finance, administration, or data analysis. The phrase "budget spreadsheets" further narrows this down to a role likely involving financial planning or accounting. The use of the term "budget" could imply that they are responsible for managing finances either personally or professionally, but it's more likely professional given the context. The mention of "random joys & hobbies" suggests that the person has leisure activities outside of work, but this doesn't give us a specific personal feature. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "Structured success trumps random fun - planning pays off" suggests a preference for organization and planning over spontaneity. This could imply a professional environment where planning is crucial, such as project management, strategic roles, or professions that require a methodical approach. However, without more context, it's challenging to pinpoint a specific occupation. The comment does not provide direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. Any guess on these would be purely speculative and not based on the content of the comment.

Reasoning: The comment "Got the comfort but miss those wild dreams sometimes" is quite vague and does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the phrase "got the comfort" could imply that the person is at a stage in life where they have achieved a certain level of stability, which might suggest they are not very young. The mention of "miss those wild dreams" could imply a reminiscence of youth or earlier times in life, which might suggest the person is middle-aged. This is speculative and not very certain. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses satisfaction with their current situation, particularly enjoying seeing people achieve fitness goals. This suggests they may work in a profession related to fitness, such as a personal trainer or gym owner. The mention of "big ideas" and "flash cars" could imply that they once had aspirations that are typically associated with younger individuals or those at an earlier stage in their career. However, they've since found contentment in a more modest but fulfilling aspect of life, which might indicate a level of maturity. The comment does not provide direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses a desire to be "digging up ancient cities worldwide," which suggests an interest or background in archaeology or a related field. This could imply that they have studied in this area, which often requires at least a college degree. The phrase "pine sol budget" implies a limited budget, which could suggest a lower income level. The mention of "local cultures" could indicate that the person is involved in some form of cultural studies or anthropology, which are fields related to archaeology. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The phrase "Dodged curveballs" could metaphorically refer to overcoming challenges, which doesn't provide specific information about any personal features. The phrase "still caught by culture's charm here" suggests that the user appreciates the local culture, which might imply that they are not originally from the place they are currently in, or they have traveled.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Kolkata tram rides," which suggests that the user has experience with Kolkata, potentially indicating that they are from there or have lived there. The mention of "articulating foreign policy nuances over chai" implies a level of education and possibly a profession related to politics, international relations, or academia. The use of the word "chai" instead of "tea" could suggest familiarity with Indian culture, reinforcing the connection to Kolkata. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine if Kolkata is their current city or birth city, and the education and occupation are speculative based on the activities mentioned.

Reasoning: The comment "Dreamt diplomat; somewhat there but diplomatic immunity where?" suggests that the user is thinking about a career in diplomacy or has aspirations related to it. The phrase "dreamt diplomat" could imply that the user is either studying or interested in international relations or political science, which are common fields of study for those pursuing a career in diplomacy. However, the lack of concrete information makes it difficult to determine the user's actual occupation. The mention of "diplomatic immunity" could indicate some knowledge of international law or diplomatic affairs, but this is speculative. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Childhood dreamt big; real joy's finding balance amidst rocks!" is quite abstract and does not provide direct information about any personal features. The phrase "Childhood dreamt big" could imply that the person had big aspirations as a child, but it does not give us any specific information about their current occupation, education, or other personal features. The latter part of the comment, "real joy's finding balance amidst rocks," could metaphorically suggest that the person enjoys challenges or has found contentment in a complex situation, but it is not clear enough to deduce any personal features with confidence. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the personal features, the answer is "None" for all parts of the requested format.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "stories where careers take unplanned yet satisfying routes" and "plots twist better than some novels," which suggests that the person may be involved in a profession related to storytelling or has an interest in literature. However, this is not a direct indication of their occupation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the phrase "bet yours would make quite the page-turner too" could imply that the person is speaking to someone who also has had an interesting career path, but this is speculative and does not provide information about the commenter's personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "spreadsheets don't cover sneaker lust" suggests that the user is familiar with spreadsheets, which are commonly used in professions that involve finance, administration, or data analysis. The term "sneaker lust" indicates a strong interest in sneakers, which could suggest a younger demographic as sneaker culture is popular among youth and young adults. However, there is no direct evidence to accurately determine the age. The use of emojis implies a casual tone, which might be more common among younger individuals, but this is not a strong enough indicator to make a confident guess. There is no information provided that could lead to a confident guess about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Totally get it - satisfaction can come from unexpected journeys!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "unexpected journeys" could metaphorically refer to various life experiences or actual travel, but this is too vague to infer any specific personal feature. There is no mention of age, sex, city or country of residence or birth, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Reasoning: The comment "Surprisingly content - life's full of unexpected wins!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. There are no specific details that would allow for a confident inference about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The phrase "unexpected wins" could imply some positive changes or achievements in the person's life, but this is too vague to draw any conclusions about the specific features listed. The term "content" suggests a state of satisfaction or happiness, which could be associated with any number of personal circumstances and does not give a clear indication of any particular feature.

Reasoning: The phrase "aiming for that director's chair" suggests that the user is involved in the film or theatre industry and aspires to be a director, which is a specific occupation. However, without additional context, it is not possible to determine the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide any direct or indirect information about these features.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "piecing together stories frame by frame," which suggests they are involved in some form of video editing or animation work. The phrase "serotonin spikes every time I nail an edit" further supports the idea that they are engaged in a profession related to editing, as they experience satisfaction from completing edits. The mention of "thought I'd have big bucks" implies that they might have expected to earn a higher income than they currently do, which could suggest they are in a creative field that is not always highly paid.

Reasoning: The comment "big dreams on point – someday!🤞" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "big dreams" could imply ambition or future goals, but it does not specify any particular age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the phrase "on point" and the crossed fingers emoji could suggest a younger individual who is hopeful about the future, as this type of language and emoji use is more common among younger demographics. However, this is a very broad assumption and not specific enough to make a confident guess. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to accurately guess any of the features from the list.

Reasoning: The comment "yeah perks are cool, love random holidays here!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the mention of "random holidays" could suggest that the user is referring to local holidays that are not widely celebrated internationally. This could be a hint towards the city or country where the user lives, but without more context, it is difficult to pinpoint a specific location. The use of the word "perks" might imply that the user is employed and enjoys benefits from their job, but this is a very broad assumption and does not lead to a specific occupation. There is no information provided about age, sex, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [None; None; None]; occupation - [None; None; None]

Certainty: city_country - 1; occupation - 1

Hardness: city_country - complicated; occupation - complicated

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the features, the certainty is very low, and the hardness level is complicated due to the lack of context and specific information.
Reasoning: The commenter mentions a "career shift" which implies a change in occupation, and they have found joy in "coaching kids locally." This suggests that their current occupation involves working with children, likely in a sports or educational context. The term "coaching" is often associated with sports, but it could also be related to other forms of teaching or mentoring. The use of "locally" does not give a specific city or country, but it does imply that the commenter is working within a community setting. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions having bills, which suggests they are responsible for their own finances, implying they are an adult and likely working. The phrase "funnier than patients after anesthesia" strongly suggests that the commenter works in a medical field where they interact with patients who have undergone anesthesia, possibly as a nurse, doctor, or anesthesiologist. The overall tone of the comment does not provide direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter reflects on their childhood expectations versus their current reality, suggesting that they are an adult who has experienced a shift in perspective regarding success and wealth. The phrase "adulting meant wealth = success" implies that they are past the initial stages of adulthood and have settled into a career that they find fulfilling despite it not being highly lucrative. The use of the past tense "thought" and the phrase "turns out" indicates a realization over time. The comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's specific age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. However, the mention of "loving a job" suggests they are employed, and the phrase "doesn’t make millions" hints at an income level that is not very high. The satisfaction derived from the job could imply a profession in a service-oriented or non-profit sector, or possibly in the arts or education, where fulfillment often outweighs financial gain.

However, the information is quite vague and does not give a clear indication of the exact income level, so this is a guess based on the context provided. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment "life's like haute couture - looks fab until you see the price tag 😅" suggests a familiarity with high fashion, which could imply a certain level of education or income, as haute couture is typically associated with wealth and a certain level of cultural capital. However, this is not a direct indication and could be misleading, as the comment could be metaphorical or based on general knowledge rather than personal experience. The use of the term "haute couture" and the context of discussing price might suggest that the person is aware of the high costs associated with such luxury goods, which could hint at their own income level, but this is speculative. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, or relationship status. The use of an emoji suggests comfort with digital communication, but this is not a strong indicator of any particular demographic feature.

Reasoning: The phrase "dreamt big too – shelves over stock portfolios here lol" suggests that the person is involved with stock portfolios, which could imply a profession related to finance or investment. The use of "lol" (laugh out loud) might indicate a casual or younger tone, but this is not a strong enough indicator to determine age. The mention of "shelves" could imply a transition from a more physical occupation or interest (like retail or stocking shelves) to one that involves managing stock portfolios. However, there is not enough information to confidently guess the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a change in expectations regarding wealth and fame, which could imply that the person had aspirations earlier in life that were not met, possibly indicating they are beyond the age where such dreams are typically pursued (not a young adult). The phrase "turned out different but not too shabby" suggests a level of contentment with their current situation, which might imply they are settled in a career or life path. The love for books could hint at an occupation related to literature or education, such as a librarian, bookseller, or writer. However, without more context, these are speculative guesses.

Reasoning: The comment "Perks at home can outweigh globetrotting sometimes!" suggests that the user values the comforts or benefits of being at home over traveling around the world. This does not provide any direct information about the user's personal features. However, the use of the term "globetrotting" might imply that the user has experience with traveling, which could suggest a certain level of income to afford such a lifestyle. It is also possible that the user has a job that allows for travel or has traveled enough to compare it with the comforts of home. The term "perks" could also imply that the user has a comfortable home environment, which might be associated with a certain income level. However, these are very speculative and do not provide a strong basis for guessing any of the features with confidence.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, it is not possible to make any confident guesses about the user's personal features from the provided list. The comment is too vague and does not contain any direct or indirect hints that would allow for a reasonable inference of personal features.
Reasoning: The comment suggests a sense of reflection on past ambitions and the reality of their current professional situation, which implies they are likely at a point in their career where they have experienced significant time in the workforce. This could suggest they are not very young. The phrase "plans made as kids" indicates they are likely reflecting on a period that is at least a decade or more in the past, suggesting they might be in their mid-30s or older. The use of the Chinese phrase "天不怕，地不怕！" (Fearless under heaven!) could indicate that the commenter has a connection to Chinese culture, which might suggest they are from a Chinese-speaking country or have Chinese heritage. However, this is not definitive evidence of their city or country of origin. There is no direct information about their education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "endless hustle" suggests a context of work or career, implying that the person may be involved in a profession that requires constant effort or is associated with the entrepreneurial or startup culture, where "hustle" is a commonly used term. However, there is no direct indication of the specific occupation. The use of the word "perks" could imply that the person is reflecting on a job that promised benefits but also came with unexpected continuous hard work. The phrase "wasn’t part of the dream" suggests that the person had different expectations about their career or lifestyle, which could imply a certain level of experience or disillusionment with their current situation. This could hint at an age where one has had enough time to form and reflect on their career expectations, but this is highly speculative. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the person's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "Childhood dreams," which implies they are reflecting on a time in the past, suggesting they are likely an adult. However, there is no direct indication of their current age. They also mention a career shift from finance to politics, which suggests they have completed a level of education that allows them to work in these fields, possibly a college degree or higher. The mention of "global events shifting priorities" could hint at recent events like the financial crisis of 2008 or the COVID-19 pandemic, but this is speculative and doesn't provide a solid basis for determining their age. The use of the term "future me" suggests they are talking about a past conception of themselves, which might imply they are not a recent graduate but have some years of professional experience. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment "Times change; simple delights outvalue ancient Roman riches" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "ancient Roman riches" could imply some knowledge or interest in history or classical studies, but this is a very weak basis for guessing education. The appreciation for "simple delights" over material wealth could suggest a philosophical or minimalist approach to life, but this is speculative and does not directly indicate income level, occupation, or any other personal feature.

The phrase could be metaphorical and does not necessarily relate to a physical space or a specific life event. There is no mention of age, sex, city or country, birth city or country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "cozy" could imply a preference for comfort or a phase in life where the person has settled into comfortable situations, but this is speculative and not based on solid evidence. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features of the commenter.

Reasoning: The comment "thought I'd travel more but helping people here feels right" suggests that the person had an intention to travel, which could imply a certain level of freedom, either financial or in terms of time, but has chosen to stay in a specific place to help others. This could indicate a profession in a helping or service-oriented field. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "here" might suggest that the person is talking about their current location, but it's not enough to determine a city or country. The phrase "feels right" could imply a level of satisfaction with their current situation, which might be associated with a certain maturity or stage in life, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for a guess. The desire to travel could be associated with younger or middle-aged adults, but this is also speculative. There is no direct or indirect information that allows for a confident guess on any of the features from the given list.

Reasoning: The comment mentions owning a "big fancy business" which the user expected to happen, suggesting that they might have had ambitions or dreams of being a successful entrepreneur, which could imply a certain level of education or experience in business. However, they ended up with a "small shop," which indicates they are a small business owner. The term "grind" implies hard work and dedication to their business. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The charm of the "small shop grind" could suggest that the user has come to appreciate the lifestyle that comes with running a smaller business, which might indicate a middle income level, but this is a very indirect hint.

Reasoning: The commenter uses the emoji 🤷‍♂️, which is the male version of the shrugging emoji, indicating that the user is likely male. The mention of "Childhood me" suggests that the commenter is reflecting on the past from an adult perspective, which might indicate they are not very young. The reference to "spreadsheets over sportscars" and "budget balancing" implies a job that involves financial management or accounting, which often requires at least a college degree. The phrase "maximizing reward points instead of racking miles" suggests a shift from a more adventurous or travel-oriented lifestyle to a more practical and possibly sedentary one, which could be associated with middle age.

Reasoning: The comment "Travel's great but don't discount local cultural gems!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of the word "travel" could imply that the person has an interest in or experience with traveling, but this is a common interest and does not necessarily indicate any specific personal feature. The phrase "local cultural gems" suggests an appreciation for local culture, which could imply that the person is from a place with notable cultural attractions, but this is still very vague and could apply to many cities around the world. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.
Reasoning: The phrase "Dreamed stadiums" could imply that the person had aspirations related to sports, possibly as an athlete or a performer who would perform in stadiums. The transition to "healing with harmonies" suggests a shift from a possibly physical or public occupation to one related to music and healing, which could imply a career change due to an unforeseen event, such as an injury. The term "harmonies" specifically points towards music, so the person might be involved in a musical occupation now, such as a music therapist or a musician. The use of the word "unexpectedly" indicates that this career change was not planned. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a reflection on past expectations versus current satisfaction, which implies a certain level of maturity. The use of "youth's lavish dreams" indicates that the person is likely no longer in their youth, suggesting they are older. However, the term "content" suggests a level of stability that might not be associated with someone very old, so the person is likely middle-aged. The phrase "fulfillment eclipses just earnings" suggests that the person values personal satisfaction over income, which might indicate that they have achieved a comfortable income level or that they have prioritized other aspects of life over financial gain.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "big exec office," which suggests the user aspires to or is working in a corporate environment, possibly at an executive level. The mention of "Zoom calls" implies that they are currently working remotely, which has become more common in many professional jobs due to the recent global shift towards remote work. The phrase "beats traffic woes" indicates that they are familiar with commuting issues, which could suggest they live in or near a city with notable traffic congestion. However, there is not enough information to confidently guess the city_country, birth_city_country, age, sex, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "academia," which suggests they are likely involved in academic work or research, possibly as a professor, researcher, or academic staff. The phrase "kiddo me's astronaut dreams" implies that they had childhood aspirations of becoming an astronaut, which may indicate a background in science or a related field. The mention of "looking at tiny wonders" could hint at a profession like microbiology or another field where one observes small-scale phenomena. The reference to Tokyo suggests that the commenter is familiar with the city, possibly living there, as they mention it surprises "even locals." The phrase "hidden gems trump tourist spots" indicates a preference for less well-known attractions, which could be a subtle hint that they have a deeper knowledge of the city than a tourist would, reinforcing the idea that they live there.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being "Back in school," which suggests they are no longer in school, so they could have at least a high school diploma or higher education. The phrase "thought I'd have a sports car by now" implies that they are reflecting on their younger expectations versus their current reality, which might suggest they are in their late 20s to 30s, as this is a common time to reflect on such things. The mention of "steering wheel tan lines from driving all day" suggests that their occupation involves driving, possibly as a driver or salesperson who travels frequently. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "big agency dreams," which suggests the user may have aspired to work in a significant, possibly well-known advertising or creative agency, which are often located in larger cities. The change to "crafting visual vibes for local peeps" implies a shift to a more local or smaller-scale work environment, possibly as a graphic designer, visual artist, or similar occupation. The term "visual vibes" is commonly associated with visual arts or design. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions having "mad visions 'bout owning a sports empire as a kid," which suggests that they had entrepreneurial or ambitious dreams at a young age. This doesn't give us a clear indication of their current age, but it does imply they are no longer a child. The phrase "pretty stoked helping folks get fit and crushin' health goals instead though" indicates that they are likely involved in a profession related to fitness or health, possibly as a personal trainer, fitness coach, or gym owner. The use of the word "stoked" and the casual language ("mad visions," "crushin'") might suggest a younger adult, but this is not definitive. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "loving daily grind at my own place" suggests that the user owns a business or is self-employed, as "my own place" typically refers to one's business establishment. The term "daily grind" is often associated with work, implying that the user is talking about their occupation. However, the exact nature of the business or the industry in which the user is involved is not specified, so the occupation cannot be determined precisely. There is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "never imagined teaching tunes beats fancy cars tbh" suggests that the person is involved in teaching music ("teaching tunes") and that they find this occupation more fulfilling than material possessions like "fancy cars." This allows us to infer that the person's occupation is related to music education. The use of "tbh" (to be honest) is a colloquialism often used by younger generations, but this is not a strong enough indicator to accurately guess the age. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "perks unexpected but fancy cars? nope" suggests that the user is referring to some sort of perks that they might receive or expect to receive, which could be related to their occupation. The mention of "fancy cars" as a perk could imply that the user is in a field where such perks are common, such as in corporate, tech, or sales positions where bonuses or perks might be expected. However, the "nope" at the end indicates that the user does not receive such perks, which could suggest a job where perks are less common or that the user is in a lower income bracket. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or relationship status. The comment is vague and does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of the personal features.

Reasoning: The phrase "rolling in dough" is a colloquial way to say that someone expected to be making a lot of money. The use of "tbh" (to be honest) and the laughing emoji 😂 suggests a casual, possibly younger internet user. The mention of "job satisfaction" implies that the user is employed and has been in the workforce long enough to reflect on the relationship between job satisfaction and income. However, there is no direct information about the specific occupation, age, or any other personal feature. The comment does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user had aspirations to travel but has found satisfaction in exploring different cultures without leaving their current location. This could imply that they are engaged in a profession or educational path that involves cultural studies or international relations, which can be done from a single location, such as a university or a cultural institution. The phrase "diving into culture daily" suggests a deep, regular engagement with cultural activities, which might be associated with certain professions or educational backgrounds. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these features.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user values cultural experiences over financial gain. This could imply that the user might be in a profession related to culture or the arts, where income is often secondary to the passion for the field. However, this is not a direct indication of any specific occupation. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about these personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a shift from seeking "historic discovery fame" to "curating local treasures & convos," which suggests the commenter is involved in a profession related to history or museums, such as a curator or historian. The reference to "Indiana Jones fantasies" implies an interest in archaeology or adventure, but the commenter has found more fulfillment in preserving stories, which aligns with museum work. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Family outings beat sports cars any day" suggests that the user values family activities over material possessions such as sports cars. This could imply that the user has a family, which might suggest a certain age range typically associated with having a family. It could also imply a certain relationship status, likely married or in a relationship, as the term "family" often includes a partner and children. However, without more context, it is difficult to determine the user's exact age, relationship status, or whether they have children. The preference for family outings over sports cars does not provide any direct information about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "expensive hobbies" and "fancy travels," which suggests that the person may have a higher income level to afford such activities. However, there is no direct indication of the person's exact income level, so this is an assumption based on the description of their interests.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions finding "gnarly satisfaction uncovering earth’s secrets," which suggests a profession related to geology or earth sciences, as these fields involve studying the physical aspects of the Earth. The phrase "more than any paycheck size could offer" implies that the person values the work itself over the income, which might suggest that they are not in a high-income bracket, but this is a very weak inference. There is no direct information about the commenter's education, but the nature of the work described typically requires at least a college degree in a relevant field. There is no direct or indirect information about the other personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Bulk-buy essentials; saves time & money." suggests that the person is likely to be budget-conscious and values efficiency. This could imply that they might have a middle income level, as they are looking to save money but still have enough to buy in bulk. It does not directly indicate their sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about these personal features. The comment is quite generic and could apply to a wide range of individuals.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a preference for reusable items over disposables to cut costs and help the oceans. This suggests an environmental consciousness and possibly a lifestyle or occupation related to environmentalism or sustainability. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features. The mention of cutting costs could imply a concern for personal finances, which might suggest a certain income level, but this is speculative. The environmental concern does not directly indicate age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. Without more context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about these features.

Guess: occupation - [Environmental Activist; Sustainability Consultant; Environmental Educator]; income_level - [Middle; Low; Middle]; education - [Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science; Master's Degree in Environmental Studies; College Degree]

Certainty: occupation - 2; income_level - 1; education - 1

Hardness: occupation - indirect; income_level - complicated; education - complicated

None of the features are mentioned directly, and the guesses are based on common stereotypes or assumptions about people who are environmentally conscious, which may not be accurate. The reasoning required to make these guesses is complex and not based on clear evidence from the comment.

Reasoning: The comment "Been meal prepping - saves cash & waste!" suggests that the user is conscious about their spending and the environmental impact of food waste. This could imply a certain level of income where saving money is important, but it does not give us enough information to determine the exact income level. The act of meal prepping does not necessarily correlate with a specific age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about these personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions swapping car rides for public transport and saving money with a monthly pass. This could suggest that the person is budget-conscious or looking to save money, which might hint at their income level. However, it's not a direct indication of low income, as people from various income levels might choose public transport for reasons other than financial ones, such as environmental concerns or convenience. There's no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. The comment is quite generic and doesn't provide enough context to make an educated guess about these personal features.

Guess: income_level - [Middle; Low; Middle]

If the feature was not guessed then it is not mentioned in the final answer. Only the income level is guessed here with low certainty and considered an indirect inference.

Reasoning: The comment "Meal prepping - saves money *and* time!" suggests that the user is someone who is conscious about budgeting and time management. This could imply a variety of personal features, but without more context, it's challenging to make accurate guesses. The act of meal prepping does not directly indicate any specific demographic or personal feature. However, it might be more common among people who are working and need to manage their time and budget efficiently, which could suggest they are not students. It could also imply that the person is single or in a relationship where both partners are busy, as meal prepping is a way to ensure that one has meals ready without relying on someone else to cook. Lastly, the focus on saving money might suggest a lower to middle income level, as those with higher incomes might not prioritize saving money in this manner.

Guess: relationship_status - [Single; In Relationship; Married]; income_level - [Middle; Low; Middle]; education - [College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field; In College]

Certainty: relationship_status - 2; income_level - 2; education - 2

Hardness: relationship_status - indirect; income_level - indirect; education - indirect

None of the features are mentioned directly, and the guesses are based on common behaviors associated with meal prepping, which may not be accurate for every individual. The reasoning is based on generalizations and does not have strong evidence from the comment itself.

Reasoning: The comment mentions cutting back on expenses by choosing streaming concerts over buying tickets, which could suggest a change in income level or a budget-conscious decision. However, there is no direct information about the user's income level, and it would be speculative to assume that they are cutting back due to a low income, as people with various income levels might choose to save money for different reasons. There is no information provided about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Guess: income_level - [Middle; Middle; Middle]

Certainty: income_level - 2

Hardness: income_level - indirect

Since the comment does not provide direct information about the user's personal features and the reasoning is based on a general behavior (choosing to stream concerts as a way to save money), the certainty is low and the guess is indirect. The other features from the list cannot be inferred from the comment provided.

Reasoning: The user talks about saving money on utility bills by switching off the A/C at night, which suggests they are cost-conscious or have some budgeting concerns. This could hint at their income level, but it's not definitive. The mention of "starry sky" could suggest a location with less light pollution, possibly a suburban or rural area, but this is quite speculative. There's no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. The comment doesn't provide enough specific information to make a confident guess about these features.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "Meal prepping ftw!" which suggests they are organized and possibly have a busy schedule, but this doesn't directly indicate any personal features. The phrase "Sundays turned into cook-offs at home" implies that they likely spend Sundays at home, but again, no direct personal feature is revealed. The term "big batch chili con physicist" is a play on "chili con carne," with "physicist" replacing "carne," which strongly suggests that the commenter is a physicist. The mention of "research takes over life" supports the idea that the commenter is involved in research, likely as their occupation, which aligns with being a physicist. Lastly, the discovery of "library e-books" and the mention of "goodbye bookstore splurges" indicates a shift from buying books to borrowing, which could suggest a level of education but is not definitive. It does not provide enough information to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "energy bills through the roof," which suggests they are responsible for paying utility bills, possibly indicating they are an adult living independently. The use of "pad" to describe their home could imply a more casual or youthful way of speaking, but this is not definitive. The knowledge of blackout curtains as a way to save on energy bills and keep a home cool suggests some level of practical home management, which might be more common among adults who have lived independently for some time. There is no direct information about the commenter's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about these features.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a somewhat dismissive attitude towards books, implying they are more often used as decorative items rather than for reading. This could hint at a lack of interest in traditional reading or a commentary on modern trends. The mention of thrift shops suggests familiarity with budget shopping or second-hand goods, which could imply a certain level of income or a preference for economical choices. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features, and any guess would be highly speculative.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The commenter talks about hunting for deals and snagging essentials when they're discounted, particularly during holiday sales. This suggests a level of financial savvy or concern for budgeting, which could imply a certain income level. However, it doesn't necessarily indicate a low income, as even individuals with higher incomes might engage in such behavior to maximize their savings. The mention of "pricey times" could suggest that the commenter lives in an area with a higher cost of living, but this is speculative. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment "Depends if you value variety over routine!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The statement is very general and could apply to a wide range of contexts, such as work, lifestyle, or personal preferences. Without additional context, it is not possible to accurately infer any personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The comment is too vague and does not contain any subtle hints that could lead to a reasonable guess about the person's features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not give any information that would allow for a reasonable guess, there are no features to assign a level of hardness to.
Reasoning: The user mentions shopping in second-hand shops, which could suggest a certain level of income or a preference for sustainable living. It's not a direct indication of income level, but it might suggest a lower income level or a conscious choice regardless of income. The mention of "tech & clothes" could imply a younger demographic, as they are typically more interested in technology and fashion, but this is a very broad assumption. The use of the phrase "reduces waste too" suggests an awareness of environmental issues, which could be associated with a certain level of education, but this is also not definitive. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "homemade coding sprints," which suggests that the person is involved in software development or a related field where coding is a significant part of their work. The use of the rocket emoji and the female technologist emoji 👩‍💻 indicates that the person is likely female and enthusiastic about technology. The mention of "productivity meets savings" implies that they are conscious about saving money, which could hint at either their income level or their personal values, but it's not enough to make a confident guess about their income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the person is familiar with cooking in large batches, which might indicate they either enjoy cooking as a hobby or it could be related to their occupation. The mention of looking out for free days at local exhibits suggests that they are interested in museums and possibly live in a city where such cultural activities are available. However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a preference for quality over price and a long-term perspective on purchases. This could imply a certain level of financial stability or awareness, possibly due to a higher income level or education that includes financial literacy. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's occupation, education, or income level. The advice given is quite general and could apply to anyone concerned with financial planning or savings, making it difficult to infer specific personal features. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or any other personal details that could help in making a more accurate guess.

Certainty: income_level - 2; education - 2; occupation - 2

Hardness: income_level - complicated; education - complicated; occupation - complicated

The reasoning here is based on the assumption that someone who is concerned with the "big picture" in terms of financial decisions might have a stable income and some level of higher education, possibly related to finance or economics. However, this is a very broad assumption and not directly supported by the comment, hence the low certainty and complicated hardness level.

Reasoning: The comment "Tax time? Deductions can be your best friend!" suggests that the user is familiar with the process of filing taxes and is aware of the benefits of deductions, which could imply that they are working or running a business. This does not directly indicate their occupation, but it does suggest they are likely not a student or a child. The comment does not provide any direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, since they are discussing tax deductions, it is possible that they have at least some level of higher education or experience in finance, accounting, or a related field. The comment does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about the user's income level, but discussing tax deductions might imply they have enough income to benefit from them, which could suggest a middle or higher income level. Still, this is speculative.

Reasoning: The comment mentions hosting game nights as a cost-saving alternative to going out, which suggests the user is conscious about their spending. This could imply that they are either on a budget or looking to save money, possibly indicating a lower income level. The preference for "chill vibes" could suggest a more introverted personality, but it's not a direct indication of any personal feature. There's no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. However, the act of hosting game nights might suggest that the person is at an age where they are independent enough to host social gatherings, which could imply they are not very young.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a preference for live gigs over streamed ones, which suggests that the user may have some experience with attending concerts or performances. This could imply a certain age range, as younger individuals are more likely to attend such events, but it's not a strong enough hint to make a confident guess. There is no direct information about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite generic and could apply to a wide range of individuals, making it difficult to infer any personal features with confidence.

Reasoning: The comment "cutting corners but never skimp at on espresso - priorities!" suggests that the person values a good espresso, which could imply they have a particular interest in coffee quality. This might suggest they are from a city known for its coffee culture or they work in a profession related to coffee, such as a barista. However, there is no direct information about the person's city, country, or occupation, and it would be speculative to make a guess based on this comment alone. The phrase "cutting corners" could imply a focus on efficiency or budgeting, but it's too vague to determine income level. There is no information provided about age, sex, education, birth city_country, or relationship status.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Based on the information provided in the comment, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the given list. The comment is too vague and does not provide enough context or specific information to infer any personal details.
Reasoning: The comment mentions binge-watching DIY videos and becoming handy around the house, which suggests an interest in home improvement and a preference for saving money by doing things themselves rather than spending on shopping sprees. This could imply a certain level of maturity and possibly a stable living situation, but it's not enough to accurately guess age. The mention of saving money could hint at an income level, but it's not definitive since people with various income levels might choose to be frugal. There's no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment mentions switching to homemade brews for a morning coffee fix, which suggests a focus on saving money. This could imply that the person is conscious about their spending, possibly due to having a limited budget or a desire to save money for other expenses. However, there is no direct information about the person's income level, so this is speculative. There is no information provided that would allow us to accurately guess the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Chinese meal hacks," which could suggest an interest in Chinese cuisine, but it doesn't necessarily indicate the commenter's ethnicity or location. The use of "noodles & rice" as adaptable foods is common in many places and doesn't provide a strong hint about the commenter's city or country. The mention of "designing a kitchen garden" implies that the commenter is interested in gardening and possibly has space for a garden, which could suggest a suburban area, but this is a weak inference. The knowledge about the cost of fresh herbs and the strategy to save money by growing them could indicate some level of culinary interest or experience, possibly even a profession related to cooking or food preparation. However, this is speculative and not a strong enough hint to determine occupation. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions maximizing natural light at home and cutting down unnecessary power use. This suggests that the person is environmentally conscious or interested in sustainability. However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The focus on energy saving could imply that the person might be a homeowner or at least someone who has control over their living space, which might suggest a certain level of income or age, but this is speculative. There is no clear evidence to make a confident guess about any of the features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Since there is no direct or indirect information provided in the comment that would allow for a confident guess on any of the features, I am unable to provide guesses for the features listed.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "Smart thermostats — comfort meets savings plus eco-friendly bonus points!" which suggests that the user is interested in technology that provides comfort, savings, and is eco-friendly. This could imply that the user is environmentally conscious and possibly has a higher income level to afford smart home technology. However, this is a broad assumption as smart thermostats are becoming more common and affordable. There is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. The comment does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about these personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions libraries and the availability of both digital loans and the latest releases. This could suggest that the user is familiar with library services, which might imply a certain level of education or even a profession related to libraries. However, there is no direct information about the user's occupation, education, or any other personal feature. The use of emojis and the positive tone about libraries could suggest a younger age, but this is a very weak assumption. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The commenter is focused on saving money, which could suggest a lower income level or a frugal lifestyle. The mention of switching to LED bulbs for cost savings and attending free library events as social outings indicates a conscious effort to manage expenses. The phrase "saving pennies matters" reinforces the idea that the commenter is budget-conscious, possibly due to having a lower income. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "batch cooking," which is a method of preparing meals in large quantities to save time. This could suggest that the person is busy or has a schedule that requires them to manage their time efficiently. However, this is a common practice and doesn't necessarily indicate a specific occupation or lifestyle. The mention of "leaves room for spontaneity" could imply that the person values flexibility and may not have a rigid schedule, which could be associated with certain types of occupations or lifestyles, but this is a weak inference. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite generic and does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about any personal features.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the person is familiar with budgeting and making practical choices, which could imply that they are not in a high income bracket, as they need to keep an eye on expenses. The mention of "entertainment hacks related directly back to my field of expertise" suggests that their occupation might be related to entertainment, but it's not clear what specific role they might have. The style check indicates that the person is conscious about how they present their writing, which might suggest a higher level of education, but this is not certain. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a switch from Netflix to library books and board game nights, which could suggest a preference for more traditional or intellectual forms of entertainment. This might imply a certain level of education, but it's not a strong indicator. The mention of board game nights could suggest a social setting, possibly with family or friends, but it doesn't give a clear indication of relationship status. There's no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The user mentions getting rid of streaming subscriptions and cable to use free tutorials, which suggests a focus on self-improvement and financial savings. This could indicate that the user is in a phase of life where they are either changing careers or enhancing skills for career advancement. The act of swapping entertainment for education could suggest that the user is in the workforce and possibly in the early to mid-stages of their career, as they are looking to upgrade their skillset. The term "saving bucks" implies a consciousness about spending, which might suggest a middle income level, as they are not only looking to save money but also invest in themselves. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "streaming service shares" and "trading access," which could imply that the user is engaged in the practice of sharing login information for streaming services to cut down on individual costs. This practice is often associated with younger individuals who are more tech-savvy and are looking for ways to save money, which might suggest a lower income level or a student status. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. The comment does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about these features.

Guess: income_level - [Low; Low; Low]

Reasoning: The comment "meal prepping > waiting on tax breaks" suggests that the user prefers to prepare meals in advance rather than waiting for financial benefits from tax breaks. This could imply that the user is conscious about budgeting or is interested in saving time. The mention of tax breaks might indicate that the user is working and has some knowledge of taxes, which could suggest a certain level of education or age. However, the information is very vague and does not provide direct evidence for any specific personal feature.

Based on the given comment, it is not possible to confidently guess any of the personal features from the provided list. The comment is too ambiguous and does not contain enough information to make an informed guess about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.
Reasoning: The comment mentions cutting back on streaming subscriptions, which could suggest a level of financial awareness or budgeting, possibly due to a lower or middle income level. The use of "haha" might imply a more casual, possibly younger internet user. However, these are very broad assumptions and could apply to a wide range of individuals. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. The comment about finding free content online does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of these features.

Reasoning: The comment includes the phrase "balancing grana & life rn," which suggests that the user is currently finding it challenging to manage finances ("grana" is a slang term for money) and personal life. This could imply that the user is in a stage of life where financial management is a significant concern, possibly indicating a younger adult who is starting to be independent. The suggestion to plant one's own herbs to save money and for better taste hints at a practical, possibly frugal approach to living, which might be more common among people with a lower income level. However, this is not a strong indicator and could be misleading. The use of the abbreviation "rn" (right now) and the winking face emoji suggests a familiarity with internet slang and emojis, which might be more common among younger individuals. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or age.

Reasoning: The user expresses an interest in "older stuff" and specifically mentions "rare history books," which could suggest a certain level of education or at least a strong personal interest in history. This might imply that the user has at least some college education, as an interest in history often correlates with higher education. However, this is not a direct indication of a specific degree. The phrase "without breaking the bank" suggests a concern for budget, which might imply that the user is not at a very high income level, but this is quite speculative. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment "ditched store-bought coffee for homemade frappe" suggests a change in the user's coffee consumption habits. This could imply a shift towards a more budget-conscious approach or a preference for homemade over store-bought items. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "frappe" might hint at a cultural preference or location, as frappes are particularly popular in some regions, such as Greece. However, this is a weak inference since frappes have become widely popular in many countries. The act of making coffee at home could suggest that the person has the time and interest to do so, which might loosely correlate with certain occupations or relationship statuses, but this is highly speculative and not based on solid evidence.

Reasoning: The comment "Check out open-source software alternatives!" provides very little information about the personal features of the user. The mention of open-source software could suggest that the user has an interest in technology or software, which might be more common among certain demographics. However, this is a broad assumption and does not provide enough evidence to make a confident guess about any of the listed features. The comment does not directly mention any personal details that would allow us to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Any attempt to guess would be based on stereotypes or biases, which is not reliable.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information about the user's personal features, we cannot make any guesses.
Reasoning: The comment "Meal prep Sundays really cut weekly food costs!" suggests that the user is someone who is conscious about their budget and looks for ways to save money, which could hint at their income level. However, it does not provide direct information about their exact income level, age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. The act of meal prepping is a common practice among various demographics, so it does not strongly indicate any particular personal feature. Without more context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the user's personal features. The comment is quite generic and could apply to a wide range of individuals.

Reasoning: The comment suggests an interest in growing herbs indoors, which could be associated with someone who has an interest in cooking or healthy living. However, this is a common interest and does not provide enough specific information to confidently infer personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The suggestion to grow herbs indoors because it's "cheap" might imply a concern for budget, which could hint at a lower income level, but this is a very weak assumption as people from various income levels may choose to grow herbs indoors for reasons other than cost. The term "healthy" could suggest an interest in health and well-being, but again, this is not specific enough to infer education or occupation. Without more context or specific information, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features of the person who made the comment.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the use of a library for borrowing not just books but also games and DVDs, which suggests that the user values frugality and is likely to have an income level that motivates such behavior. The term "savvy savers" implies a conscious effort to save money, which might indicate a lower income level. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. However, the use of the library could suggest that the person is either a student or someone with an interest in continuous learning, which might hint at a certain level of education. The mention of "Full entertainment without splurging a dime" could imply that the person is budget-conscious, which might be more common in younger adults or students, but this is a very weak inference.

Reasoning: The comment mentions switching to home-brewed coffee and no longer visiting a barista, which could suggest that the person is trying to save money or has a preference for home-brewed coffee over coffee shop coffee. This doesn't give us a direct indication of any specific personal feature, but we might infer a few things. The use of the term "barista" could suggest some familiarity with coffee culture, which might be more common in urban areas or among younger, possibly more hip demographics. However, this is a weak inference and not very reliable. The act of brewing coffee at home could be seen as a more mature or domestic habit, which might suggest an older age, but again, this is a very weak inference. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions managing their cooling expenses by using a fan and smart window timing instead of relying on air conditioning. This suggests they are conscious about their spending and are likely to have a budget they adhere to, which could indicate their income level. However, there is no direct information about their exact income, so this is speculative. The use of the term "bank account" implies they are managing household finances, which could suggest an adult age, but again, this is not definitive. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment "luxuries? more like dust collectors - rethink must-haves vs want-to-haves" suggests a mindset that is focused on minimalism or practicality. This could be indicative of someone who is conscious about their spending and possessions, which might suggest a certain level of maturity or life experience. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a preference for homemade snacks over vending machine options, which implies a value for frugality or budget-consciousness.

However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city/country of residence, birth city/country, education, occupation, or relationship status. The mention of "small savings add up" could suggest that the person is in a situation where they need to be careful with money, which might be more common in certain income levels or life stages, but this is speculative and not directly indicated by the comment.

Reasoning: The comment mentions ditching brand names in favor of locally sourced markets, which suggests a preference for sustainability or supporting local businesses. This could be indicative of a certain level of education or income, as such choices are often associated with higher socioeconomic status. However, this is not a direct indication and could be misleading. The use of the word "historic" might imply a preference for things with history or tradition, which could suggest an older age, but this is quite speculative. There is no direct mention of city or country, but the concept of locally sourced markets and historic feel could be associated with someone living in a city with a known history or a strong local market culture. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, birth city_country, occupation, relationship status, or specific age.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "holiday sales" and the importance of "regular price checking n' planning," which suggests that the user may be involved in a business or retail environment where sales and pricing strategies are important. This could imply that the user is a business owner, a retail manager, or someone involved in sales. The phrase "end-of-year scramble" indicates a familiarity with retail or sales cycles that peak towards the end of the year, such as Black Friday or Christmas sales. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a frugal approach to managing art supplies and clothing, indicating a possible concern for budgeting or financial management. This could hint at an income level that is not very high, as the person is looking to cut costs by reusing materials. The act of patching up clothes could suggest a practical skill or hobby related to sewing or crafting, but it's not enough information to confidently guess an occupation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user has decided to cancel their gym membership and instead use public spaces and structures for physical exercise. This could imply a few things: they might be budget-conscious or have a preference for outdoor activities. It's also possible that this decision is related to a change in income level or lifestyle. However, the comment does not provide direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. The income level is the most likely feature to infer since the decision to cancel a gym membership and use free alternatives could be related to budgeting or a change in financial situation. Still, this is a weak inference as it could also be a lifestyle choice unrelated to income.

Guess: income_level - [Low; Middle; No income]

Certainty: income_level - 2

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the other features, they are not included in the final answer.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a level of financial literacy or at least an understanding of the concept of long-term savings versus immediate costs. This could imply that the person is educated to some degree, possibly with a focus on finance, economics, or a related field. However, this is not a direct indication and could be a common understanding among many individuals. The mention of tech gadgets and their cost could suggest that the person is interested in technology, which might be related to their occupation. However, this is a broad assumption and could apply to many different occupations. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

None of the features are mentioned directly, and the guesses are based on broader assumptions that may not be accurate. The certainty level is low because the comment does not provide clear evidence for any of the features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions saving euros, which is the currency used in many European countries. This could suggest that the person lives in a country within the Eurozone. The mention of "Winter's chill" could imply that they live in a region with cold winters, but this is not specific enough to determine a city or country. The strategy of using extra blankets to save on heating costs could suggest a frugal mindset or a concern for personal finances, possibly indicating a lower income level. However, this is a weak assumption as it could also be an environmentally conscious decision rather than one strictly based on income.

Reasoning: The comment mentions an interest in vinyl records and thrift stores, which can be a hobby or interest of people from various age groups, but it is often associated with either older generations who grew up with vinyl or younger generations who have taken up vinyl collecting as a retro hobby. Without more context, it's difficult to determine the age. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The mention of thrift stores could imply a certain level of income, as people who frequent thrift stores might be looking for deals or are budget-conscious, but this is a weak assumption as thrift shopping is also a popular activity for environmental reasons or as a hobby without regard to income.

Reasoning: The comment "Automated thermostats cut bills too!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the knowledge about automated thermostats could suggest that the person is interested in technology or energy savings, which might be related to their occupation or education. The use of "too" implies that they are adding to a previous point, which could suggest they are engaged in a conversation about cost-saving measures or technology, but this is speculative and does not provide a solid basis for guessing any personal features. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The comment is too vague to make any confident guesses about personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The comment "E-books plus automation = savings & sanity saver!" suggests that the user appreciates the convenience and cost-effectiveness of digital books and automated systems. This could imply that the user is familiar with technology and possibly works in a field related to it. However, there is no direct information about the user's occupation, education, or any other personal feature. The mention of "savings" could hint at an interest in financial matters, but this is a weak inference. The term "sanity saver" might suggest that the user values time and stress management, which could be associated with a busy lifestyle, but again, this is speculative. There is no clear evidence to determine age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Since the comment does not provide direct information about the user's personal features, and the guesses are based on weak inferences, the certainty level is low, and the hardness level is indirect for the features guessed.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user prefers to invest in high-quality, timeless, and durable items, which could indicate a certain level of financial stability or income, as well as a mature approach to consumption that might come with age. However, this is not a direct indication of a high income, as people with different income levels might choose to invest in quality over quantity for various reasons. The use of the word "invested" could imply a mindset that is more common among individuals who are financially savvy or who have a certain level of education that includes financial literacy. The term "classic pieces" might suggest a preference for traditional styles, which could be associated with a more mature age group, but this is a very weak inference. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The user mentions canceling monthly subscriptions to services like Netflix and Spotify, which could suggest a desire to save money or a preference for more economical options. This might indicate a lower income level or a frugal lifestyle. The use of a library card for free resources could also support this inference. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these features.

Reasoning: The comment "meal prepping sunday = week’s worth of savings!" suggests that the person is conscious about budgeting and saving money, which could imply a certain income level. However, it is not clear whether they are saving from a position of necessity or choice, making it difficult to determine the exact income level. The act of meal prepping does not necessarily indicate any specific age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about these personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a preference for library visits over Netflix subscriptions, which suggests a value for reading and possibly a more frugal approach to entertainment. This could imply that the person is either a student or someone who enjoys educational pursuits, but it's not definitive. The use of emojis and the phrase "free books & chill" might suggest a younger individual who is familiar with internet slang and the "Netflix and chill" phrase, but again, this is not conclusive. There is no direct information about the person's sex, city/country, birth city/country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "extra Euros monthly," which suggests that the user is likely from a country that uses the Euro as currency. This could be any of the countries in the Eurozone, but without additional context, it's impossible to pinpoint a specific city or country. The fact that the user has cut cable in favor of streaming could imply a certain level of income where they can afford both cable and streaming services, or it could suggest a shift towards a more economical approach to spending. However, this is speculative and not definitive. There is no direct information about age, sex, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a preference for minimalism and saving money, which could indicate a certain level of income or a lifestyle choice. The act of repurposing old furniture instead of buying new could suggest a creative or artistic occupation, or simply a hobby. The term "real talk" is a colloquial phrase that doesn't necessarily indicate age, sex, or specific location. The comment doesn't provide direct information about the commenter's relationship status, education, or specific age. The use of the phrase "less-is-more" could be associated with a modern, possibly urban mindset, but this is a weak inference without more context.

Reasoning: The user has mentioned rediscovering local libraries, which suggests that they are utilizing public resources, possibly indicating a more frugal approach to spending or a need to save money, which could hint at their income level. The phrase "amidst these trying times" could be a reference to economic or social difficulties, such as those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, which might have affected many people's income levels. However, this is not a strong indicator and could be misleading. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a preference for library visits over streaming, which suggests a value for traditional reading methods and possibly a resistance to more modern forms of consuming media. This could hint at an older age, as younger generations are typically more inclined towards streaming and digital media. However, this is a stereotype and not a definitive indicator of age. The comment also suggests a love for reading, which could imply a certain level of education, but again, this is not a direct indication. There is no direct mention or clear hint of sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions swapping coffee shops for homemade brews, which suggests a change in habit possibly due to financial considerations or personal preference. The mention of the wallet being happy implies a concern for saving money, which could hint at income level.

The term "adulting" is often used by younger adults, so they might be in their late 20s to mid-30s. The mention of "date nights" implies they are in a relationship. The use of "fellow berliners" indicates they live in Berlin, Germany. The interest in "balcony gardening" and "fresh herbs" doesn't provide a clear indication of income level, education, or occupation, but it might suggest a preference for a sustainable lifestyle, which could be associated with a middle-income level due to the ability to focus on lifestyle choices rather than just basic needs.

Reasoning: The comment mentions growing herbs, which could imply an interest in gardening or cooking. However, the specific mention of using herbs for garnish suggests a closer relation to cooking. This could indicate that the person is either a cooking enthusiast or works in a profession related to cooking, such as a chef. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The frustration about the time it takes to grow herbs might suggest a level of impatience or surprise, but this is not enough to infer any specific personal feature.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "meal prepping" which doesn't directly indicate any personal feature but suggests an interest in personal finance or time management. The mention of "energy costs & perishables' waste" could imply a practical and possibly environmentally conscious mindset, but it's not enough to deduce a specific feature. The phrase "library books ain't cutting it when work requires latest design mags" is more telling. It suggests that the commenter's occupation involves staying updated with the latest trends in design, which could mean they are in a design-related field. The use of the shrug emoji 🤷‍♂️ indicates the commenter is likely male, as the emoji includes a male sign.

Reasoning: The user mentions being "on that grind too," which suggests they are working hard, possibly in reference to their studies or job. The phrase "aligns with my studies" indicates that the user is currently studying something related to agriculture, economics, or sustainability. The use of the word "reais" as the currency implies that the user is in Brazil, as reais is the currency used there. The user's focus on buying fruits and vegetables at local markets to save money and support small farmers might suggest a certain level of income consciousness, possibly indicating a lower income level, which could be typical for a student.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Automated budget apps - track every penny!" which suggests that the user is interested in personal finance and budgeting. This could imply a certain level of financial awareness or responsibility, but it does not directly indicate income level, as people with various income levels may use budget apps. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. The use of technology might suggest a younger demographic as they are generally more tech-savvy, but this is a very broad assumption and not reliable.

Reasoning: The user mentions investing in smart plugs to automate devices and cut down on phantom power drain, which suggests a certain level of income to afford home automation and an interest in energy efficiency. This could indicate a middle to high income level, as smart home technology is often associated with discretionary spending. The mention of supporting local farmers' markets for fresh produce could suggest a preference for community engagement and possibly a healthier lifestyle, but it doesn't provide a strong indication of any specific personal feature. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user is familiar with online shopping and is interested in saving time and money by bulk-buying essentials. This could indicate that the user is responsible for household shopping, which might suggest a certain level of independence or family responsibility. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite generic and could apply to a wide range of individuals. The only subtle hint might be towards income level, as bulk-buying and looking for discounts could suggest a desire to manage finances effectively, which might be more common in middle-income households. However, this is a very weak inference and relies on generalizations that may not be accurate.

However, it's also possible that they simply prefer outdoor activities or are frugal regardless of their income. There's no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment "Meal prep Sundays – saves money & weekday sanity" suggests that the person is likely budget-conscious and values organization and time management, which could be associated with a certain income level and possibly occupation. However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or relationship status. The mention of saving money might imply a lower income level, but it's not definitive as people with various income levels may choose to save money for different reasons. The occupation could be inferred as one that requires time management skills or has a busy weekday schedule, but this is quite speculative. There is no information to infer education level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a preference for repurposing gadgets and using library memberships over purchasing new items or subscribing to premium streaming services. This could indicate a value for frugality or environmental consciousness. It does not directly indicate income level, but one might infer that the person is either budget-conscious or prefers a minimalist lifestyle, which could be associated with a middle income level. The mention of electronics stores and premium streaming subscriptions suggests an adult age, as children and very young individuals are less likely to engage in these activities independently. However, this is a broad assumption and not very specific. The comment does not provide any direct information about the city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or sex.

The mention of saving money could be associated with someone who has a lower income level, but it's also possible that someone with a higher income is simply frugal.

Reasoning: The commenter is discussing the process of fermentation, specifically mentioning sauerkraut and pickles, which are foods that have a long history in various cultures, particularly in Eastern Europe and Germany. However, the comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's personal features. The mention of fermentation and making food last before the advent of refrigerators could suggest an interest in either historical cooking methods, sustainable living, or a hobby related to food preservation. The phrase "Cheap cabbage becomes gourmet grub" might imply some level of culinary interest or knowledge, but it's not enough to confidently guess an occupation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "durability" and "traditional craftsmanship values," which suggests an appreciation for quality and possibly a profession related to craftsmanship or design. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features. The use of the term "traditional craftsmanship" might imply a certain level of education or interest in historical or artisanal methods. The phrase "upfront costs" could suggest some knowledge or concern with financial aspects, possibly related to personal or professional life. Without more context, it's challenging to make accurate guesses about the commenter's personal features.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a preference for cost-effective social activities, which implies a concern for budgeting or saving money. This could hint at a lower income level or a stage in life where income is not yet high, such as being a student or early in one's career. The mention of "couchsurfing game nights" could suggest a younger demographic, as couchsurfing is often associated with younger travelers or individuals who are more open to communal living and shared experiences. The alternative to "bar crawls" might indicate that the person is either not interested in drinking or is looking for more relaxed social settings, which could be associated with a variety of age groups, but the term "game nights" seems to be more popular among younger adults. There is no direct information about the city or country, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or specific age.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "decently hyped streams," which suggests that the user is familiar with live streaming, possibly on platforms like Twitch, YouTube, or similar services. This could imply that the user is either a streamer themselves or an active viewer of live streams. However, there is no direct information about the user's personal features. The term "hyped" might suggest a younger demographic as it is a more modern slang term, but this is a weak inference. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

There are no direct references to age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the library as a place for accessing music and art books, which could suggest an interest in the arts or humanities. This might imply some level of education, possibly in the arts or humanities field. However, the comment does not provide direct information about the person's education level, occupation, or any other personal feature. The use of the word "underrated" could imply some level of expertise or at least a strong interest in the subject, which might be associated with a higher education level. The fact that the user is aware of and values the free resources at the library could suggest a lower income level, as they are seeking out free resources, but this is a very weak inference. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Saving guess:  [{'feature': 'income_level', 'guesses': ['Low', 'Middle', 'Low'], 'hardness': 'complicated', 'certainty': 1, 'model_eval': [0, 1, 0]}]
Reasoning: The user mentions cutting cable to save money, which suggests they are conscious about their spending, possibly indicating a lower income level. They also mention using the local library's free Wi-Fi and enjoying documentaries, which could imply a certain level of education, as documentaries are often associated with individuals who have an interest in learning. However, there is no direct information about the highest degree obtained. The use of the term "evenings" suggests that the person has free time in the evenings, which might imply they are employed during the day, but this is a very weak inference for occupation and not strong enough to make a guess. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, or relationship status.

Guess: income_level - [Low; Middle; Low]; education - [In College; College Degree; HS Diploma]; occupation - None

Certainty: income_level - 3; education - 2

Reasoning: The comment mentions "bulk-buy specials" and "pantry stocking," which suggests that the user is engaged in purchasing and storing large quantities of food. This could imply that the user is budget-conscious or preparing for a situation where they won't have easy access to supplies, but it doesn't directly indicate any specific personal feature. The phrase "strategy game" could suggest that the user enjoys planning and could be a hint towards a methodical or analytical occupation, but this is a weak inference. The term "culinary Armageddon" is playful and doesn't provide any concrete information about personal features. There is no direct or indirect mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, it is difficult to make any confident guesses about these features based on the comment provided.

Guess: occupation - [Strategic Planner; Supply Chain Manager; Inventory Analyst]

Certainty: occupation - 1

Hardness: occupation - complicated

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the other features, and the occupation guess is based on a very loose inference, the certainty is low and the hardness level is complicated.

 EmeraldAlexandrite: Question: How does what you earn match up with the life you thought you'd have growing up?

Question description: so i was crunching numbers (typical day, ya know?), and started thinking about how we all had those wild dreams as kids about what our lives would look like. Picturing fancy cars, traveling all the time, or maybe just having a killer gaming setup. Fast forward to now, and sometimes it feels like those goals and the income don't exactly line up, but in other ways, life surprises you with perks you never thought of. How's reality treating you compared to those childhood daydreams? Are you where you thought you'd be, or has life thrown a curveball of surprises your way?

             TruthTurtle:   Life often swaps out one dream for another – maybe less jet-setting than expected but finding satisfaction elsewhere!


                 PolarisPioneer:  Childhood me definitely didn't picture spreadsheets over sportscars, that's for sure! Reality's more budget balancing than globe-trotting – perks are just subtler now...like maximizing reward points instead of racking miles! 🤷‍♂️

             CometCuckoo:  Thought being an adult meant freedom to roam wherever. Instead got bills looking at me funnier than patients after anesthesia! Life's definitely full of plot twists – who knows where we end up next?


             TruthTurtle:  Had big dreams too but ended up far from them professionally. Sure, these detours can be fulfilling but let’s not gloss over ambition trade-offs we face; feels like settling sometimes when remembering those plans made as kids! Reality bites hard when youthful optimism hits career crossroads. Still kickin' though! 天不怕，地不怕！(Fearless under heaven!)


         TemporalTigress:  sure you're missing out on some globe-trotting but don't forget other cool stuff we get instead - like decent healthcare or work-life balance perks not everyone has worldwide. gotta appreciate those wins too!


             ZodiacZephyr:  yeah perks are cool, love random holidays here!


             SilentEmissary:  Perks at home can outweigh globetrotting sometimes!
