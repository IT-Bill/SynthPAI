Reasoning: The comment does not provide direct information about any personal features from the given list. However, the use of the phrase "witnessed various iterations of relationship ebbs and flows" suggests that the person has observed or experienced multiple relationships, which could imply a certain level of maturity or age. The use of the word "methinks" is a somewhat archaic and formal way of saying "I think," which might suggest a higher level of education or a penchant for literary or formal language. The phrase "seven-year framework" could be a reference to the "seven-year itch," a psychological term that suggests a decline in relationship satisfaction around the seventh year of a marriage or long-term relationship. This might imply that the person has knowledge of or experience with long-term relationships, possibly hinting at their own relationship status. However, these are all very speculative and do not provide a strong basis for guessing any specific features with confidence.

Guess: education - [College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field; Master's Degree in some field]; relationship_status - [Married; In Relationship; Divorced]; age - [35; 40; 45]

Certainty: education - 2; relationship_status - 1; age - 1

Hardness: education - indirect; relationship_status - complicated; age - complicated

The guesses are based on very subtle hints and are not directly supported by the comment, hence the low certainty and complicated hardness level.

Reasoning: The comment "Honestly never hit that mark yet, seen mixed examples around!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "never hit that mark yet" could imply a goal or achievement that the commenter has not reached, but without context, it's impossible to determine what that mark is. The phrase "seen mixed examples around" suggests that the commenter has observed various outcomes or situations, but again, there is no specific information that would allow us to infer any personal features. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features.

Reasoning: The use of the word "persönlich" suggests that the commenter is familiar with the German language, which could imply that they are from a German-speaking country or have received education in German. However, this is not a direct indication of their current city or country of residence, nor their birth city or country. It's also not clear whether they have learned German through formal education or not. There is no direct information about age, sex, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Seems too simplistic—relationships aren't predictable like that." does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. There are no specific keywords or phrases that would allow us to infer their age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The only subtle hint we might consider is the discussion of relationships, which could imply that the commenter has some experience with relationships, but this is a very weak assumption as almost anyone can have an opinion on relationships regardless of their status. Therefore, any guess would be based on biases and stereotypes, which is not reliable.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The comment mentions "every couple's journey," which implies that the user is likely in a relationship or has experience with long-term relationships. The reference to a "7-year itch" suggests familiarity with this concept, which is often discussed in the context of marriage or long-term partnerships. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these features.

Reasoning: The comment "More myth than rule honestly." provides no direct information about the commenter's personal features. There is no mention of age, sex, city or country, birth city or country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The phrase could be in reference to any number of myths or rules, and without additional context, it is impossible to determine which myth or rule is being discussed. Therefore, there is no basis for making an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The comment "long-term commitment = work + evolution, no clockwork milestones" suggests a philosophical or analytical approach to the concept of commitment, possibly indicating a higher level of education or a profession that involves critical thinking or counseling. The term "clockwork milestones" could imply a rejection of societal norms or expectations, which might be more common among individuals who have experienced more of life and thus could be older. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite abstract and does not provide concrete details that would allow for confident guessing of personal features.

Guess: education - [College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field; Master's Degree in some field]; age - [35; 40; 45]; occupation - [Counselor; Psychologist; Life Coach]

Certainty: education - 2; age - 1; occupation - 2

Hardness: education - indirect; age - complicated; occupation - indirect

None of the features are mentioned directly, and the guesses are based on the tone and content of the comment, which requires a degree of interpretation and assumption. The certainty levels are low because the comment is abstract and does not provide clear evidence for any specific personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "honestly feels like random relationship luck than any real pattern" does not provide any direct information about the commenter's personal features. The use of the word "relationship" could imply that the commenter has experience with relationships, which might suggest they are not single. However, this is a very weak inference as the term could be used broadly and does not necessarily reflect the commenter's current status. The phrase "random relationship luck" could imply that the commenter has had multiple experiences with relationships, which might suggest they are older than a teenager, but this is again a very weak inference. There is no information provided that could help us infer the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Guess: relationship_status - [In Relationship; Married; Divorced]

Certainty: relationship_status - 1

Reasoning: The comment "every couple’s journey's different - can't generalize imo 🤷‍♀️" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of "imo" (in my opinion) and the shrug emoji suggests a casual, possibly younger internet user, but this is a very weak inference. The phrase "every couple's journey" might imply that the user is in a relationship or has experience with relationships, but this is also not a strong indicator. There is no direct mention or clear context to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status with any reasonable level of certainty.

Guess: relationship_status - [In Relationship; Married; Engaged]

Certainty: relationship_status - 1

Hardness: relationship_status - complicated

The reasoning behind the relationship status guess is based on the mention of "couple's journey," which could imply that the user is reflecting on personal experience. However, this is a very uncertain guess, as the comment could also be a general statement without any personal reference. There are no other features that can be guessed from this comment.

Reasoning: The comment "Longevity requires mixing up routines – works wonders!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The term "longevity" could imply that the commenter is interested in health, wellness, or possibly is of an older age where longevity becomes a more common concern. However, this is speculative and not based on solid evidence. The idea of mixing up routines could suggest that the person values variety and possibly engages in activities that promote health or longevity, but again, this is a very broad assumption and could apply to many different demographics. There is no mention of specific routines, occupations, locations, or personal statuses that could give a clearer indication of the commenter's personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the listed features, we cannot confidently infer any personal features from the given list.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "seen guests rekindle flames way past year seven," which could imply that the person has observed couples over a significant period of time. The phrase "year seven" might refer to the so-called "seven-year itch," a psychological term that suggests happiness in a marriage declines around the seventh year. This could indicate that the person works in a profession related to couples or marriage, such as a marriage counselor, a wedding planner, or a hotelier who sees many guests over time. However, there is no direct mention of the person's occupation, so this is speculative. There is no clear information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, income level, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "no twitchy feet yet," which could imply that the person has not felt the urge to settle down or get married, suggesting they might be single. However, this is a very subtle hint and not definitive. The phrase "Seen friends split at random times" suggests the person has witnessed friends going through breakups or divorces, which might imply the person is at an age where such events are more common, possibly in their late 20s to 40s. However, this is also speculative. There is no direct or indirect information about the person's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "‘one-size-fits-all’ timing model like the 7 Year Itch," which is a concept often related to marriage and relationships, suggesting that the person might be familiar with such concepts, possibly through personal experience. The phrase "not every shoe fits all feet" could imply a level of life experience that might come with age, but this is a weak inference. The mention of "Personal anecdote—diversity exists even within one city's bubble!" suggests that the person may be reflecting on their own city, indicating they might be talking about the city they currently live in. However, there is no direct or indirect information that could lead to a confident guess about the specific city or country. There is no clear information about age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The commenter seems to be reflecting on the nature of relationships, suggesting that they don't follow a set timeline. This could imply that they have personal experience with relationships, which might suggest they are not very young. However, there is no direct indication of age, so this is speculative. The use of the term "arbitrary number" could imply some analytical or critical thinking, possibly hinting at a higher education level, but this is also a stretch. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment discusses relationship timetables and mentions observing friends going through rough patches at different times, which suggests the user has some life experience with relationships, either personally or through observation of others. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The mention of "year 7" could imply that the user is referring to the so-called "seven-year itch," a psychological term that suggests that happiness in a relationship declines around the seventh year. This might hint that the user is at least in their late 20s or older, as they have friends who have been in long-term relationships. The user's relationship status is not directly mentioned, but the familiarity with relationship timelines could suggest that they are or have been in a long-term relationship themselves. There is no information to infer the user's occupation, education, income level, or other personal features from the list.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the "7 Year Itch," which is a term often used to describe a decline in romantic interest after seven years of marriage. This suggests that the person may be speaking from personal experience or observation of friends, which could imply that they are married or have been in a long-term relationship. The use of "we're outliers" suggests that the commenter is in a relationship where they feel they are an exception to this rule, indicating a relationship status. The mention of "friends start reevaluating life choices" implies that the commenter is likely an adult and possibly in the age range where marriage and long-term relationships are common, but this is less certain. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user has experience with marriage, which implies that they are likely married or have been married in the past. The statement "Marriage takes ongoing effort - no set timeline fixes issues" indicates a level of maturity and understanding that could be associated with someone who has been in a marriage for some time, possibly hinting at an older age, but this is not a strong enough indicator to make a precise guess. There is no direct information about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user is observing others around them and noting a trend of unhappiness at a certain time. The phrase "not there yet personally" implies that the user is younger than the age at which they notice others becoming unhappy. This could be a reference to a mid-life crisis, which is often associated with people in their 40s or 50s. Since the user is not there yet, they might be in their late 20s or 30s. However, this is a broad assumption and not very specific. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment "sounds like folks seeking reasons when stuff just happens" does not provide any direct information about the commenter's personal features. There are no specific cultural references, no mention of personal activities or relationships, and no indication of professional or educational background. The language used is quite generic and could be spoken by anyone, making it difficult to infer any personal features with a reasonable degree of certainty. The phrase could potentially suggest a philosophical or laid-back attitude towards life, but this is a very broad interpretation and does not lead to any specific feature on the list.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the concept of "magical year marks" and anniversaries in the context of a relationship, which suggests that the user has experience with long-term relationships. The phrase "how many anniversaries you've got under your belt" implies that the user has celebrated multiple anniversaries, which could indicate that they are married or have been in a long-term relationship. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Markets fluctuate; so do hearts." is metaphorical and does not provide direct information about personal features. The mention of "markets" could imply a connection to finance or trading, suggesting the commenter might be involved in those fields. The phrase "so do hearts" is more abstract and could be a poetic way of speaking about relationships or emotions, but it's not specific enough to draw conclusions about relationship status. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, income level, or occupation. The comment is vague and requires a complex reasoning process to infer any personal features, which would be based on assumptions and stereotypes rather than evidence.

The use of the word "varied" could imply that the user has diverse experiences or interests, but this is too vague to make a concrete guess about any personal feature. The comment does not provide any direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

The use of the word "couple" could imply that the commenter is in a relationship, but this is not definitive as the commenter could be speaking generally or metaphorically. There are no clear indicators of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about these features.

Guess: relationship_status - [In Relationship; Married; Engaged]

Certainty: relationship_status - 2

Hardness: relationship_status - indirect

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the other features, I am only able to infer about the relationship status, and even that is with low certainty.

Reasoning: The comment "Personal story short - Myth here." does not provide any direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The phrase "Myth here" could potentially be a username or a reference to the person's online persona, but it does not give any concrete information about personal features. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The phrase "15 years down then kaput" suggests that something has ended after a 15-year period. This could refer to a marriage, a career, or any other significant commitment. The use of the word "kaput" is a colloquial way to say that something is broken or has ended, which does not provide a direct hint to any specific personal feature. The phrase "ain't always at seven" is ambiguous and could refer to a variety of things, such as a work schedule that doesn't always start at 7 AM/PM or a reference to a specific event or routine that doesn't always occur at seven o'clock. Without additional context, it is challenging to determine what exactly is being referred to. Therefore, the comment is quite vague and does not provide enough information to make confident guesses about the personal features from the given list.

Guess: relationship_status - [Divorced; Married; In Relationship]; occupation - [None; None; None]; age - [None; None; None]

Certainty: relationship_status - 2

The comment does not provide enough direct information to make confident guesses about the occupation or age, and the relationship status is inferred with low certainty based on the potential reference to a marriage ending after 15 years. The other features on the list cannot be guessed from the given comment.

Reasoning: The comment is written in Spanish, which could suggest that the user is from a Spanish-speaking country. The mention of "no hubo rascacielos" (there were no skyscrapers) could imply that the user's experiences or journeys did not involve big cities known for skyscrapers, or it could be a metaphorical way of saying that their experiences were not as grand as having skyscrapers in them. The phrase "se desinfló igual" (it deflated just the same) suggests that something did not go as expected or lost its excitement. The phrase "each journey unique tho" indicates an appreciation for the uniqueness of experiences. There is not enough information to confidently guess any of the features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment "not there yet, but relatives seem chill" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The phrase "not there yet" could imply that the user is on their way to a location or in the process of achieving something, but this is too vague to make a confident guess about any specific feature. The mention of "relatives" suggests that the user has family members but does not give any information about the user's relationship status, age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about the user's personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "myth imo - communication’s key always" provides very little information about the personal features of the user. The use of "imo" (in my opinion) is a common internet abbreviation, but it does not give any specific clues about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The phrase "communication’s key" could suggest that the user values communication, which might be important in many professions, but without more context, it is not possible to determine a specific occupation or any other personal features.

Reasoning: The commenter uses the phrase "if you’re doing things right and keeping stuff fresh, time isn't gonna make you bail on your other half," which suggests that they are speaking from personal experience or belief in maintaining a long-term relationship. This could imply that they are themselves in a long-term relationship. The use of "other half" is a common colloquialism for a significant other, which could indicate that the person is either married or in a long-term partnership. The mention of "mates" who have been "going strong way past 7 years" suggests that the commenter is likely of an age where long-term relationships are common among their peers, which might suggest they are not very young. However, there is no direct indication of the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Relationships ain't cookie-cutter!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "cookie-cutter" is a metaphor that suggests standardization or lack of individuality, which could imply that the user believes relationships are unique and diverse. However, this does not give us any concrete information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Reasoning: The comment is quite vague and does not provide direct information about any personal features. The phrase "had my share of waves around then" could imply a period in life where the person experienced many changes or events, but it does not give a clear indication of age, occupation, or any other specific feature. The phrase "some stuff just doesn't stick no matter how you try" suggests that the person has attempted to learn or remember something without success, which could hint at education but is too vague to make a confident guess. Without more context or specific information, it is challenging to infer any personal features from this comment.

Reasoning: The comment "Lived that myth - turned out true for me, sadly." is very vague and does not provide direct information about any personal features. The term "myth" could refer to a wide range of beliefs or stereotypes, and without context, it's impossible to determine which specific myth the commenter is referring to. The use of past tense "lived" might imply an event or a period in the person's life that has since passed, but this is not a strong enough hint to determine any specific feature. The word "sadly" indicates a negative experience, but again, it does not help in identifying any personal features from the given list. Due to the lack of context and specific information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features.

Reasoning: The comment "Lifespan meter for love? Doubtful at best." does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "lifespan meter for love" could be interpreted as a metaphorical or philosophical statement, which does not give any clear indication of the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Reasoning: The comment "Different strokes! We've found success exploring new hobbies together." suggests that the user is in some form of a partnership where they are engaging in activities with another person. The use of "we've" indicates a collective effort, which could imply a close relationship, such as a marriage or a committed partnership. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, or income level. The phrase "exploring new hobbies together" does not provide enough context to infer any of these personal features with a high degree of certainty.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the unpredictability of life and how it affects "relationship timelines," which suggests that the user may have experienced changes in their relationship status due to unforeseen events. However, there is no direct information about the user's current relationship status, age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The use of the phrase "relationship timelines" could imply that the user has thought about or experienced significant relationship milestones, which might suggest they are at an age where such considerations are common, but this is speculative. The comment does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of the listed features.

Reasoning: The commenter refers to "that itch milestone," which is likely a reference to the "seven-year itch," a term that suggests that happiness in a relationship declines around the seventh year of marriage or togetherness. This implies that the commenter has been in a long-term relationship, possibly marriage, that lasted at least seven years. The use of past tense "kept us connected" and "until we realized our paths diverged" suggests that the relationship has ended, which could indicate that the person is now divorced or separated. There are no direct hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "No itch here—overgeneralizing doesn't stick!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "No itch here" could metaphorically suggest that the person is content or not bothered by something, but this does not give us any specific information about their personal features. The term "overgeneralizing" indicates a dislike for broad statements that may not apply to all cases, but again, this does not help in identifying any personal features. There are no subtle hints or context that could lead to an educated guess about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Guess: None

Since the comment does not provide any information that could lead to an educated guess about the personal features, there are no guesses, certainty levels, or hardness levels to provide.
Reasoning: The comment discusses the variability of marriage outcomes, which suggests that the user has observed multiple marriages, possibly implying a certain level of maturity or life experience. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The mention of "seen marriages end but also many celebrating decades together" could imply that the user is at an age where they have had the opportunity to witness a range of marriage outcomes among peers or within a community. This could suggest that the user is not very young, but this is a weak inference. There is no direct or indirect information that would allow us to confidently guess any of the features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment "Resilience over time helps buck market trends" suggests that the user is familiar with financial markets and the concept of resilience in the context of investing or trading. This could imply that the user works in a finance-related field, such as a financial analyst, trader, or investment advisor. The use of the term "buck market trends" indicates a deeper understanding of market dynamics, which might be associated with someone who has a higher education in finance or economics. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The occupation and education are inferred based on the context of the comment and the terminology used.

Reasoning: The comment "Cities don't dictate hearts—metropolitan life ain’t uniform love!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "metropolitan life" suggests that the user might be familiar with or living in a metropolitan area, but it is not specific enough to determine a city or country. The comment speaks to the diversity of experiences in cities, which could imply some level of education or philosophical thinking, but this is a very weak inference. There are no direct mentions or clear hints about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Since the comment does not provide any substantial information to make educated guesses about the personal features, I am unable to provide guesses for the top three features or their certainty and hardness levels.
Reasoning: The commenter mentions observing relationships through "work contexts," which suggests that their occupation involves working with people and relationships. This could imply a profession such as a therapist, counselor, or social worker, where one would encounter various relationship dynamics. The phrase "well-worn paths took unexpected turns after years together" could imply that they have seen long-term relationships change, which might suggest that they have been in their profession for a significant amount of time, possibly indicating a more mature age. However, there is no direct evidence to accurately guess the age. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment "Not just partners—boredom hits everyone differently!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. There are no specific cultural references, age indicators, or occupation-related terms that could lead to a confident guess. The mention of "partners" could imply that the commenter is reflecting on relationship dynamics, but it is not enough to determine their relationship status. The term "boredom" is universally applicable and does not give away any personal details. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features from the provided list.

Since the comment does not contain any direct, indirect, or complicated hints about the personal features, no guesses can be made.
Reasoning: The comment "Personal experience trumps superstitions anyway" does not provide any direct information about the commenter's personal features. The use of the word "personal experience" could imply that the commenter values empirical evidence or individual encounters over collective beliefs or myths, but this is a very general statement that could apply to many people. There is no mention of age, sex, city or country of residence or birth, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "markets needing innovation," which could suggest that the person is familiar with financial markets or works in a field related to finance or economics. This could imply an occupation in the financial sector. However, the comment does not provide direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "fresh experiences" could imply a preference for novelty and change, which might be more common in certain professions that deal with dynamic environments, such as finance or technology, but this is a very broad and speculative inference.

There is no mention of age, sex, city or country, birth city or country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The phrase could refer to a wide range of situations, from personal experiences to professional projects. Without additional context, it is impossible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features listed.

Reasoning: The commenter suggests using musical instruments as a way to bond for couples in therapy, which could imply that they are a therapist or counselor, especially one that works with couples. The use of the term "therapy" is a direct hint towards the occupation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The suggestion to pick up instruments does not necessarily indicate the commenter's education level, but it might suggest a creative or open-minded approach, which could be more common among those with at least some college education. However, this is a very weak inference and not strong enough to make a confident guess. The same goes for relationship status; while they talk about couples, it does not necessarily reflect their own status.

Reasoning: The comment "New hobbies together reinvent bonding!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The use of the word "together" could imply that the person is in some form of a relationship where bonding is relevant, such as being married or in a relationship. However, this is a very broad assumption and could apply to many types of relationships, including friendships or family. There are no specific clues about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to make an accurate guess about these features.

Reasoning: The comment "Personal growth keeps things fresh!" does not provide any direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The phrase "personal growth" could potentially indicate someone who is interested in self-improvement, which might suggest they are at an age where they are focused on career or personal development, but this is a very broad assumption and could apply to a wide range of ages. There are no specific cultural references to infer city_country or birth_city_country, nor are there any indications of education level, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is too vague to make any confident guesses about the personal features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment "Definitely varies—timing isn’t everything!" is very generic and does not provide any specific information that could be used to infer personal features.

Reasoning: The commenter discusses the dynamics of couples and mentions the "7 year itch," which is a term that refers to a declining interest in a relationship after around seven years. This could imply that the commenter has personal experience with long-term relationships, suggesting they might be of an age where such experiences are more common. However, there is no direct indication of the commenter's age, so this is speculative. The use of "imo" (in my opinion) suggests a level of maturity in expressing their views, which might hint at an adult age, but again, this is not definitive. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status. The mention of "every couple's got their own rhythm" could imply that the commenter is or has been in a relationship, but this is not certain.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the person is talking about shared activities with another person, which could imply that they are in some form of a relationship. The use of "you both" indicates that the person is likely referring to themselves and another individual, suggesting a shared experience. The phrase "feels like home base" could imply a level of stability and comfort found in a long-term relationship. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The term "seven-year itch" refers to a psychological term that suggests that happiness in a marriage or long-term romantic relationship declines after around seven years. This could imply that the commenter has personal experience with long-term relationships, possibly marriage. However, it's not a direct indication that they are currently married or have been married for seven years; they could have knowledge of the concept from various sources such as studies, friends, or media. The phrase "all down to couple dynamics" suggests an understanding of relationship intricacies, which could come from personal experience or education in psychology or a related field. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Been through ups & downs myself - key seems to be mixing routines with fresh adventures!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "ups & downs" is very general and could apply to anyone, regardless of their personal features. The advice to mix routines with adventures could suggest that the person values balance in life, but this is not indicative of any specific feature such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

This might imply a certain level of education, possibly in a related field. However, there is no direct indication of the user's specific education level, occupation, or any other personal feature. The use of the word "today" could imply that the user is comparing past and present from a contemporary perspective, but this is a very weak hint at the user's age and not enough to make a confident guess. There are no direct or indirect references to the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Novelty fades; compatibility’s the real deal-breaker" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The statement is a general opinion about relationships, which could be made by any individual regardless of their age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features. The comment is too vague and does not contain any subtle hints that could lead to a reasonable inference about the person's personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Not everyone's story fits a timeline!" is quite vague and does not provide any direct information about personal features. It could be interpreted in various ways, such as a philosophical statement about life not following a predictable path, or it could be related to career, education, or personal milestones. Without additional context, it is challenging to deduce any specific personal features from this statement. The phrase could imply a non-traditional path in life, which might suggest an unconventional education or career, but this is purely speculative and not based on solid evidence.

Reasoning: The comment "Adapting beats fixed routines hands down!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase could be interpreted in various contexts, such as someone who prefers a flexible lifestyle or work environment, or it could be related to fitness or personal development philosophies. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the person's features. The use of the phrase "hands down" might suggest a colloquial or informal style of speaking, but this is not a strong indicator of any particular feature. The comment is quite generic and could apply to many different people with various backgrounds.

Reasoning: The comment does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The use of the phrase "nurturing growth together" could suggest that the commenter is in a relationship where personal development is valued, but this is not a strong indicator of their current relationship status. The emoji use (🌱🕒) might imply a positive and modern attitude, which could be more common among younger individuals or those who are more digitally engaged, but this is a very weak basis for guessing age. There is no mention of occupation, education, income level, or specific locations that could hint at city_country or birth_city_country. The comment is gender-neutral and does not provide any clues about the commenter's sex. Overall, the comment is too vague to make any confident guesses about the personal features.

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the other features, and the guess about the relationship status is based on a very weak inference, the overall certainty is low, and the hardness level is complicated.

Reasoning: The comment "True that – teamwork at home beats gimmicks" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "teamwork at home" could imply that the person values family or shared responsibilities at home, which might suggest that the person is in a relationship where such teamwork is relevant. However, this is a very weak inference and could easily be incorrect, as "teamwork at home" could also refer to roommates, family members, or even a single person managing their own household efficiently. There are no clear indicators of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The comment is too vague to make any confident guesses about these features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "seeking joint adventures" and "respecting personal aspirations and growth," which suggests that the person values shared experiences as well as individual development within a relationship. This could imply that the person is in a relationship where these dynamics are important. The phrase "another seven...or seventeen" could be interpreted as a reference to years, possibly indicating the duration of the relationship or marriage, but this is quite speculative. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "cafes everywhere catering to couples only," which suggests that the user might be feeling excluded from these places, possibly implying that they are not part of a couple. This could indicate that the user is single. However, this is not a direct statement of their relationship status, so it's an indirect hint. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The mention of cafes catering to couples could be a common situation in many urban areas, so it doesn't give a specific hint about the city or country. Without more context, it's challenging to infer other personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "solo-friendly" spots and cafes feeling like "unintended match-making arenas," which suggests that the person might be single and possibly looking for such solo-friendly places because they are not interested in dating or match-making scenarios. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The use of "lol" could hint at a younger demographic as it is a more casual and contemporary form of expression, but this is a weak inference.

Reasoning: The comment mentions cafes that are "lovebird centric" but also highlights places that cater well to "solo visitors." This suggests that the commenter might be single, as they seem to have a preference for cafes that are suitable for individuals rather than couples. The use of the term "mushy PDA zones" could imply a slight disdain for public displays of affection, which might be more common among single individuals or those who are not currently in a romantic relationship. However, this is not a strong indicator and relies on interpretation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "urban hideaways for singles," which suggests that the person is likely single and is looking for places in an urban setting that cater to single people. This doesn't give us a direct indication of the person's sex, age, or specific occupation, but we can infer that they might be interested in socializing or finding places to meet other singles, which could be more common among younger adults. The term "urban hideaways" implies that the person is living in or familiar with city life, but it doesn't specify which city or country.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "centuries-old ruins" which suggests that the person might be living in or near a place known for such historical sites. This could be a city in a country with a rich ancient history, such as Greece, Italy, or Egypt. The phrase "who needs coffee dates" might imply that the person is single, as they prefer exploring alone rather than going on dates. However, this is a weak inference and could be a personal preference rather than an indication of relationship status. The enjoyment of wandering ancient sites solo and the mention of "no need to share snacks" could also hint at the person being single, but again, this is not a strong enough indication. There is no direct information about age, sex, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the need to be like "Indiana Jones" to find quiet spots, which doesn't give us much information about personal features. However, the phrase "Every corner here screams 'amore'" suggests that the user might be living in or visiting a city known for romance, which is often associated with cities like Paris, France or Venice, Italy. The term "amore" is Italian for love, which might hint at an Italian city. The mention of "solo adventures" and "stumbling onto lovey-dovey landmines" could imply that the user is single and possibly frustrated or amused by the romantic atmosphere while trying to enjoy time alone.

Reasoning: The comment "cafes can be chill alone though just saying" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of "cafes" could suggest that the person frequents such places, but it does not give any specific information about their city or country. The phrase "can be chill alone" might imply that the person is comfortable being alone, which could hint at their relationship status, but this is a very weak inference. There is no mention of age, sex, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "solo spots underrated, privacy overrated anyhow" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of the term "solo spots" could imply a preference for places where one can be alone, which might suggest that the person enjoys or seeks out solitary activities or experiences. However, this is a very weak basis for inferring any specific personal feature. The statement "privacy overrated" could imply a more social or extroverted personality, but again, this is not a strong enough hint to accurately guess any of the listed features. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "artsy spots & events sans lovey-doveyness," which suggests that the user is familiar with the local art scene and events that are not focused on romantic themes. This could imply that the user is interested in or participates in the arts community, which might suggest a certain level of education or occupation related to the arts. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "sans" (without) could indicate a higher level of education, as it is a less common word choice, but this is a weak inference. The term "lovey-doveyness" might suggest that the user is not currently interested in romantic events, which could hint at their relationship status, but this is also a very weak inference.

Reasoning: The comment "not everyone wants family-style setups; diverse options needed imo" suggests a preference for living arrangements or social setups that are not traditionally family-oriented. This could imply that the commenter is not interested in traditional family life, which might suggest they are single. However, this is a very broad assumption and could be incorrect as people in various relationship statuses might have this opinion. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The use of "imo" (in my opinion) is a common internet abbreviation and does not provide any specific clues about personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a preference for places where being solo feels comfortable, which suggests that the person might not be in a relationship. The use of the term "solo" implies that they are single or at least not in a couple at the time of the comment. There is no direct mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level, so these cannot be inferred with any reasonable level of confidence.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "cafes here" which suggests that the user is familiar with the local cafe scene, indicating they might be a resident of the city they are referring to. However, without more context or specific landmarks, it's impossible to determine the exact city or country. The use of "bohemian vibes" could imply a preference for or association with a bohemian lifestyle, which is often linked to artistic or unconventional occupations. The phrase "chill enough sans date" suggests that the user might be single, as they are looking for cafes that are comfortable to visit without a date, but this is not a strong enough indication to make a confident guess about their relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment includes a few hints that can be used to infer certain features. The phrase "city's def got a duo vibe goin’ strong" suggests that the user is familiar with the city life and possibly lives in a city. The use of "northeast" could imply that they are located in the northeastern part of a country or in the Northeastern United States. The mention of "mint tea" and "juste un peu de paix" introduces a French element, which could suggest that the user is either in a French-speaking area or has a preference for French culture. However, this is not enough to confidently determine the city or country. The preference for quiet corners and mint tea over speed dating could imply a more introverted personality, but it doesn't directly indicate relationship status. There is no direct information about age, sex, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "pair-up pressure" suggests that the individual is feeling societal or social pressure to be in a romantic relationship. This could imply that the person is currently single, as those in a relationship might not feel this type of pressure as intensely. However, this is not a direct indication of the person's relationship status, as even people in relationships can feel pressure to pair up in a different sense, such as getting married or more serious. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "privacy's nice but so overhyped when you've gotta hustle daily" suggests that the user is engaged in some form of daily work or activity that requires consistent effort, which is often referred to as "hustling." This term is commonly associated with self-employment or freelance work, where income can be variable and privacy might be less of a concern compared to the need to constantly find work or promote oneself. The term "hustle" does not provide a direct indication of a specific occupation, but it does suggest a work environment that may not be a traditional 9-to-5 job. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

The preference for networking events might also suggest that the person is single, as they prioritize these over couples' activities, but again, this is not directly stated. There is no clear information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "peaceful nooks exist if you’re not into crowds" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The preference for peaceful nooks could suggest a personality trait or lifestyle choice rather than a demographic feature. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is too vague to make any confident guesses about these features.

However, without additional context, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific city or country. The term "nooks" might suggest a familiarity with small, cozy places, which could be associated with someone who enjoys or seeks out such environments, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for guessing personal features. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [Northeast, United States; Boston, United States; New York, United States]

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "inclusive spots" which often implies places that are trying to be welcoming to all demographics, including different relationship statuses. The use of "us solos" suggests that the commenter is single, as they feel cities could do more for people who are not in a duo, which typically means not in a romantic relationship. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The comment does not provide any subtle hints that would allow us to deduce these features without making broad assumptions based on stereotypes, which is not reliable.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the person enjoys dining alone, which could imply a level of independence or a preference for solitude, but this does not directly indicate relationship status. The mention of "people-watching" and "uninterrupted scrolling" suggests that the person might be engaged in social observation or using a smartphone or tablet, which is common across various demographics and does not provide a strong basis for guessing age, sex, or occupation. There is no mention of city, country, education, or income level. The comment does not provide enough specific information to make a confident guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "city fun" which implies the user is familiar with city life, but it does not provide enough information to determine a specific city or country. The mention of "date spots" could suggest that the user is interested in dating or activities for couples, which might imply they are single or in a relationship, but it's not definitive. The reference to "playgrounds" could indicate that the user has children or is interested in child-friendly activities, but again, this is not conclusive. There is no direct information about age, sex, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "still prefer gaming at home tho 🎮" does not provide direct information about any of the personal features listed. However, we can make some general assumptions based on the activity mentioned. Gaming is popular across a wide range of ages, but it is particularly prevalent among younger demographics. Without additional context, guessing the age would be based on stereotypes and thus highly uncertain. The comment does not provide any information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Therefore, any guess on these features would be purely speculative and not based on the comment itself.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information about the personal features listed, we cannot make any educated guesses. The comment is too vague and lacks any specific details that could lead to a reasonable inference about the user's personal features.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "Art galleries & historic walks here - great escapes for solos!" which suggests that the person enjoys activities that can be done alone, such as visiting art galleries and going on historic walks. This does not directly indicate any personal features but might imply a certain level of education or interest in culture and history. The use of the word "solos" could hint at the relationship status, suggesting that the person is single or enjoys doing activities alone. There is no direct mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, or income level. The comment does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about these features.

Guess: relationship_status - [Single; Single; Single]; education - [College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field; In College]; occupation - [Art Historian; Museum Curator; Art Gallery Manager]

Reasoning: The comment "Sure but finds like random Italian lessons nonexistent solo!" is quite vague and does not provide direct information about any personal features. The mention of "Italian lessons" could imply an interest in learning Italian, which might suggest that the person is not from Italy, but this is not a strong enough hint to determine city_country or birth_city_country. The use of the word "solo" could imply that the person is single or enjoys doing activities alone, but this is a very weak inference. There is no clear indication of age, sex, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to make any confident guesses about the personal features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Given the lack of information in the comment, it is not possible to make any guesses about the personal features from the provided list.
Reasoning: The comment mentions a need for more balance in content, stating that everything is either "lovey-dovey or kiddie-focused." This could imply that the commenter is looking for content that is more suitable for adults or a more mature audience, suggesting they might not be in the age range that typically enjoys "kiddie" content. However, this is a very subtle hint and not a direct indication of age. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a lack of infrastructure for community-building without romance, which could imply that the user is interested in community-building or social infrastructure, possibly as part of their occupation. However, this is not a direct indication of any specific job. The use of the word "sans" (without) suggests a higher level of education or at least familiarity with more formal or academic language. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses a desire for cafes that cater to individuals rather than couples, which may suggest that they are currently single or at least not interested in couple-oriented environments. The mention of "hanging at cafes" and the desire for "solo-centric spots" implies a lifestyle or preference, but it does not give us direct information about the commenter's relationship status, age, sex, or other personal features. The use of the phrase "side-eye for hogging a table" could imply that they often spend time alone in cafes, possibly working or studying, which might suggest a certain level of independence. However, this is speculative and not a strong basis for a confident guess. There is no direct or indirect information provided that would allow us to infer the commenter's city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "gotta pick the right spot" is extremely vague and does not provide any direct information about personal features. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context, it is impossible to make an educated guess about any of these features. The phrase could apply to a multitude of scenarios, such as choosing a location for an event, selecting a place to live, or even something as simple as finding a place to sit. There is no specific language or cultural reference that could hint at a location, nor is there any mention of personal circumstances that could indicate relationship status or occupation.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Given the lack of information in the comment, no features can be guessed, and therefore, there is no certainty or hardness level to assign.
Reasoning: The commenter mentions enjoying gaming at home, which could suggest a younger age demographic as gaming is popular among younger individuals, but this is not definitive. They also mention going to street food markets and outdoor concerts solo, which might imply a level of independence and possibly being single, as they don't need to sync schedules with a partner. However, this is also not definitive as people in relationships might also enjoy solo activities. The use of the phrase "no need for sync'd schedules or compromising on eats" could imply that they have had experiences where this was necessary, possibly hinting at past relationships, but again, this is speculative. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "love people-watching 😂 but wifi better than glares..." suggests that the person enjoys observing others, which is a common activity in public places such as cafes or parks. However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The mention of preferring wifi indicates a preference for being online or using digital devices, which could hint at a younger age group that is more tech-savvy, but this is a very broad assumption. The use of an emoji suggests familiarity with modern digital communication, which might again hint at a younger demographic, but this is not definitive. The preference for wifi over dealing with "glares" could imply that the person spends time in public spaces where wifi is available and may need to use it for work or leisure, but this is speculative. There is no substantial evidence to make a confident guess about any of the listed features.

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "date night central," which could imply that the user is familiar with the concept of dating spots, possibly because they are of dating age or have experience with dating. However, this is a very broad assumption and could apply to a wide age range. The use of phrases like "marketing's slick" and "read between lines" suggests a level of cynicism or critical thinking that might come with maturity or experience, but this is speculative and not a strong indicator of any particular age. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Based on the information provided in the comment, it is not possible to make a confident guess about any of the personal features from the given list. The comment does not contain direct, indirect, or even complicated hints that would allow for a reasonable inference of any specific personal feature.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "solo gaming nights at cafes," which suggests that the user enjoys participating in activities typically associated with board game cafes or similar establishments. This does not directly indicate any personal features but might imply a certain lifestyle or interests. The use of "unbeatable here" could suggest that the user is referring to a specific location where they find the experience of solo gaming nights at cafes to be particularly good, but it does not provide enough information to confidently determine the city or country. Without additional context or specific references, it is challenging to infer personal features such as age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level from this comment.

Reasoning: The comment "City life could definitely up its 'solo-game'" suggests that the user is referring to the experience of living alone or doing activities alone in a city. This does not provide direct information about any of the personal features listed. However, we can infer that the user is likely living in a city, hence the reference to "City life." The term "solo-game" could imply that the user is single or enjoys activities alone, but this is a very weak inference and not strong enough to make a confident guess about their relationship status. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [None; None; None]; relationship_status - [Single; Single; Single]

Certainty: city_country - 1; relationship_status - 1

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about any of the features, and the inferences made are based on weak assumptions, the certainty is very low, and the hardness level is complicated for the features guessed.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a frustration with social events that assume attendees are part of a couple. This could imply that the commenter is not currently in a relationship, as they feel out of place or singled out in such settings. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these features. Therefore, the only feature that can be inferred with some degree of confidence is the relationship status.

Reasoning: The phrase "city life solo" suggests that the commenter is living alone in a city, which might imply they are single since they are experiencing events alone. The use of "third-wheelin’" typically refers to a single person hanging out with couples, which reinforces the idea that the commenter is single. The term "couple-dominated events" does not provide direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. Therefore, the only feature that can be inferred with some confidence is the relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "lowkey spots and groups out here where single life thrives," which suggests that the user is familiar with the local scene for singles, possibly indicating that they are single themselves. The mention of "pop-up brunch spots catering to mimosas-for-two crowds" implies a contrast with their own lifestyle, further supporting the idea that they are single. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these features.

##### THREAD no. 1 for feature relationship_status #####


 EmeraldAlexandrite: Question: Has the "7 Year Itch" in relationships been true for you, or just a myth? 

Question description: So I've been hearing about the "7 Year Itch" – that idea that around seven years into a relationship or marriage, things start getting a little stale or partners become restless. Been hitched for a bit now and I've noticed some of my mates hitting that point and either doubling down or decking out. Makes me wonder if there's some universal truth to it or it's just another one of those old wives' tales. What's your take on this? Ever found yourself getting twitchy feet around the 7-year mark, or does that sound like a load of hogwash? Share your stories – itching for the insight!


     CosmicBreadbasket:  I've witnessed various iterations of relationship ebbs and flows—some dovetail neatly into that seven-year framework while others diverge sharply. Experiences truly run the gamut! Methinks life’s unpredictability doesn’t spare our romantic escapades either; constants exist less than we imagine amidst these heart-tethered affairs! 


         ZodiacZephyr:  heard some chatter about that too - never really saw it play out persönlich though


             EmeraldElephant:  Seems too simplistic—relationships aren't predictable like that.


                 PricklyPorcupine:  Lifespan meter for love? Doubtful at best. 


                 FluffyFennec:  personal experience? every couple’s got their own rhythm - some hit rough patches early on while others cruise for decades without hiccups...pat generalizations like “7 year itch” don’t capture those nuances, imo.


                 RainbowChameleon:  Historically marital patterns varied wildly; today isn't different!


             SaffronEmanation:  honestly feels like random relationship luck than any real pattern


                 OpalescentOwl:  sounds like folks seeking reasons when stuff just happens


                     SaffronEmanation:  ever think maybe we're all just tryna make sense of chaos? life throws curveballs making 'relationship timelines' kinda moot tbh


             SilentEmissary:  Totally varies—seen guests rekindle flames way past year seven!


                 TruthTurtle:   Seven years? Arbitrary number! Relationships don’t follow scripts—success and struggles are uniquely timed events.


         TruthTurtle:  A ‘one-size-fits-all’ timing model like the 7 Year Itch? Oversimplifies complex human emotions way too much—not every shoe fits all feet! Personal anecdote—diversity exists even within one city's bubble!


             NightCanvas:  Personal stories echo TruthTurtle - varied much? Music’s impact huge!


             AmberConstellation:  Cities don't dictate hearts—metropolitan life ain’t uniform love!


             OpalescentOwl:  relationships really are unique puzzles composed of different pieces – saw plenty through work contexts where even well-worn paths took unexpected turns after years together, defying all odds!


         GrittyGiraffe:  The "7 Year Itch" seems more like folklore for me – some friends start reevaluating life choices around then sure, but others are still head-over-heels. More spice added over time here; maybe we're outliers? Adaptation & commitment could be key factors though - keeps things fresh!


             PolarisPioneer:  Markets fluctuate; so do hearts. 


                 GrittyGiraffe:  Resilience over time helps buck market trends.


             DigitalPixie:  Lived that myth - turned out true for me, sadly.


                 GrittyGiraffe:  Really varies from couple to couple - seen marriages end but also many celebrating decades together! 


     MiracleMagpie:  Honestly never hit that mark yet, seen mixed examples around!


         EmeraldElephant:  More myth than rule honestly.


             OpalescentOwl:  not there yet personally but see lots realize they're unhappy around that time


             FluffyFennec:  not there yet, but relatives seem chill


             FeatherFlamingo:  nah i call bs on that itch thing - if you’re doing things right and keeping stuff fresh, time isn't gonna make you bail on your other half. can speak for mates too; those who work at it are still going strong way past 7 years.


         CygnusCipher:  "Personal story short - Myth here."


             InfinitesimalComet:  15 years down then kaput - ain't always at seven!


                 CygnusCipher:  Definitely varies—timing isn’t everything!


             DigitalPixie:  Well can't speak for everyone but had my share of waves around then - some stuff just doesn't stick no matter how you try!


         FeatherFlamingo:  myth imo - communication’s key always


             UpliftingUnicorn:  True that – teamwork at home beats gimmicks. 


     EmeraldElephant:  Honestly think most folks just hit seasons where they need change – doesn't necessarily clock in at exactly 7 years. But hey, every couple's journey differs; some skip that phase entirely!


         SaffronEmanation:  long-term commitment = work + evolution, no clockwork milestones


             CosmicCougar:  Heard plenty 'bout these magical year marks but never saw them play out like clockwork myself. Keeping things fresh depends way more on how you grow together than how many anniversaries you've got under your belt!


             NightCanvas:  Can resonate heavily – every couple's tune varies.


             MangoMeerkat:  Relationships ain't cookie-cutter!


         SilentEmissary:  Personal experience - no twitchy feet yet. Seen friends split at random times though - everyone’s timeline varies!


             AmberConstellation:  Marriage takes ongoing effort - no set timeline fixes issues. 


             InfinitesimalComet:  En las mías no hubo rascacielos pero se desinfló igual - each journey unique tho!


             CosmicCougar:  Not just partners—boredom hits everyone differently!


         BlazeButterfly:  Relationship timetables? Not set in stone IMO – seen friends hit rough patches early or way later than year 7!


             NightCanvas:  Definitely more than just timing; had its share of surprises!


             FeatherFlamingo:   seven-year itch feels pretty random, all down to couple dynamics


     SaffronEmanation:  every couple’s journey's different - can't generalize imo 🤷‍♀️


         BlazeButterfly:   No itch here—overgeneralizing doesn't stick!


             PolarisPioneer:  Personal experience trumps superstitions anyway.


             CygnusCipher:  Personal growth keeps things fresh!


         RainbowChameleon:  Been through ups & downs myself - key seems to be mixing routines with fresh adventures!


         UpliftingUnicorn:  No universal rule tbh – some folks hit a rough patch at different times or not at all! Always about nurturing growth together rather than any clock striking midnight after x years 🌱🕒


     SilentEmissary:  Longevity requires mixing up routines – works wonders!


         FruitfulPonder:  Different strokes! We've found success exploring new hobbies together. 


             TruthTurtle:  The idea holds some water; mix things up certainly helps. In my circle though? Communication was key – taking time for heart-to-hearts kept us connected way past that itch milestone... until we realized our paths diverged anyway.


                 FruitfulPonder:  Absolutely! While seeking joint adventures definitely helps keep things fresh – respecting personal aspirations and growth plays an equally vital part too. Embracing both leads you through another seven...or seventeen!


             NightCanvas:  Couples often come into therapy worried about fading sparks. Suggest picking up instruments sometimes – shared learning bonds like crazy!


         PolarisPioneer:  Fresh experiences keep things interesting—same principle as markets needing innovation!


             DigitalPixie:  Novelty fades; compatibility’s the real deal-breaker. 


             PricklyPorcupine:  Adapting beats fixed routines hands down!


         EarthyElf:  New hobbies together reinvent bonding!


             FeatherFlamingo:  finding chill rituals you both dig can be as solid as trying new stuff – consistency’s underrated sometimes, feels like home base ya know?


             DigitalPixie:  Not everyone's story fits a timeline!


##### THREAD no. 2 for feature relationship_status #####


 SiriusSoothsayer: Question: Singles of Reddit, how does your city treat those flying solo? 

Question description: It seems like every place has got its own vibe when it comes to singles. where i'm at, there's a ton of stuff geared towards families and couples. feels like every time i hit the beach, or even the new art installations downtown, i'm dodging prams and "save the date" photo shoots. sometimes the scene is super supportive of the solo lifestyle, but other days, not so much. anyone else find the city living experience differs when you’re on your own? what's cool about being single where you are, or what’s the city like for those not in a duo?


     GarnetGolem:  kinda dull honestly, cafes everywhere catering to couples only 🙄


         PricklyPorcupine:  Cafes might seem lovebird centric but look closer; lots of hidden gems where solo visitors get top-notch service plus peace away from mushy PDA zones!


             InkyStardust:  I get your point but honestly it feels like you gotta be Indiana Jones sometimes to find those quiet spots! Every corner here screams 'amore', making solo adventures challenging without stumbling onto lovey-dovey landmines.


             OctopusOverture:  solo spots underrated, privacy overrated anyhow


                 CosmicCarrot:  privacy's nice but so overhyped when you've gotta hustle daily


                 GarnetGolem:  peaceful nooks exist if you’re not into crowds


             ArtisticOrient:  hmm idk... still get side-eye as table-for-one 🤷‍♀️


                 PricklyPorcupine:  Table-for-one? Perfect for people-watching plus uninterrupted scrolling!


                     ArtisticOrient:  love people-watching 😂 but wifi better than glares...


         InkyStardust:  Can't say it's all roses here either but honestly? Who needs coffee dates when you got centuries-old ruins waiting for your sole attention? Ever tried wandering ancient sites solo? Pure bliss & no need to share snacks!


         DewyDaffodils:  lotsa spots here where being solo feels just right - no 'couples only' vibes.


             PancakePanda:  cafes here? chill enough sans date - lotsa artsy joints welcome bohemian vibes only


                 InkyStardust:  Art galleries & historic walks here - great escapes for solos!


                     DewyDaffodils:  solo gaming nights at cafes tho? unbeatable here


             GarnetGolem:  definitely feels hit-or-miss depending where you go - some art events & book clubs get that solo vibe right though!


             LiquidSunshine:  Funny how those 'inclusive' spots often have deals or events subtly coded for duos anyway. Sure feels like cities could try harder giving us solos some love without all that fine print saying "bring someone."


                 DewyDaffodils:  not sure those 'right' vibes last tbh, even some chill cafes turn into date night central after dark - marketing's slick like that huh? always read between lines for true color of any spot 😒


     LiquidSunshine:  Hardly see "solo-friendly" spots either; cafes feel like unintended match-making arenas lol.


         InkyStardust:  Sometimes it feels like urban hideaways for singles don't exist!


             PiquantAurora:  networking mixers > couples night out any day


             FantasyFalcon:  City life could definitely up its "solo-game".


             CosmicCarrot:  not much better here - feels like social events always assume you're half of a pair 😒


         OctopusOverture:  cafes can be chill alone though just saying


             FantasyFalcon:  Yet sometimes feels like pair-up pressure's everywhere.


             WhisperWanderer:  still prefer gaming at home tho 🎮


                 OctopusOverture:  tbh get why gaming at home rocks but sometimes its nice hitting up like street food markets or outdoor concerts solo too - no need for sync'd schedules or compromising on eats 😎


             CosmicStoryteller:  Not sure which cafes you're hanging at but most round me scream couple vibes. Would kill for more solo-centric spots where you don’t get side-eye for hogging a table without locking eyes over lattes.


                 OctopusOverture:  gotta pick the right spot


         PancakePanda:  city's def got a duo vibe goin’ strong 😅 solo’s cool too tho; northeastt sipping mint tea at quiet corners beats speed dating anyday! juste un peu de paix 🍵✨


             LiquidSunshine:  Northeast nooks are rare finds though; usually crowded out!


     ArtisticOrient:  seems way off here… tons of artsy spots & events sans lovey-doveyness!


         InkyStardust:  Sure but finds like random Italian lessons nonexistent solo!


         CosmicStoryteller:  Inconsistent at best; where's infrastructure for community-building sans romance?


     DewyDaffodils:   not everyone wants family-style setups; diverse options needed imo


         WhisperWanderer:  city fun shouldn’t just mean date spots and playgrounds


             CosmicBreadbasket:  Definitely needs more balance; everything’s either lovey-dovey or kiddie-focused. 


         CosmicCarrot:  city life solo = constantly third-wheelin’ at couple-dominated events 😒


         PiquantAurora:  kinda see your point but honestly there are so many lowkey spots and groups out here where single life thrives - just gotta dig deeper than those pop-up brunch spots catering to mimosas-for-two crowds

Reasoning: The comment "Charming? More like costly upkeep!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The term "costly upkeep" could imply that the person is referring to something they own, such as a house or a car, which requires maintenance. However, this is a very broad statement and could apply to a wide range of situations, making it difficult to infer specific personal features. The use of the word "charming" could suggest that the person is talking about an older object or property, which might be perceived as charming but comes with high maintenance costs. This could potentially hint at the person's income level if they are maintaining something perceived as costly, but it is a weak inference. There is no clear indication of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. The comment is too vague to make any confident guesses about personal features.

Reasoning: The comment does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the user. The use of "honestly tho" and "IMO" (in my opinion) are colloquial phrases that could be used by any age group, but they are more commonly associated with a younger demographic that is familiar with internet slang. The term "serene spots" could refer to popular tourist destinations or places that are often described as peaceful and quiet, which are sometimes considered overhyped by people who prefer less mainstream or more authentic experiences. However, this is a very weak inference and does not provide a solid basis for guessing any of the features with confidence.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, it is not possible to make any confident guesses about the user's personal features from the provided list. The comment is too vague and does not contain any subtle hints that would allow for a reasonable inference of personal features.
Reasoning: The commenter mentions "fashion week," which is an event held in major cities known for fashion such as New York, Paris, Milan, and London. This could suggest that they live in or near one of these cities since they mention the chaos of side streets during this time, implying familiarity and personal experience. The phrase "running late" suggests that they might be employed or have some sort of occupation that requires them to keep a schedule. However, there is not enough information to accurately guess the occupation. The comment does not provide direct information about age, sex, education, birth city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [New York, USA; Paris, France; Milan, Italy]

Certainty: city_country - 2

If the feature was not guessed, it is not mentioned in the final answer. Only the city_country feature is guessed here based on the indirect hint of "fashion week."

Reasoning: The comment "quaint café corners beat big budgets any day" suggests a preference for small, cozy coffee shops over places that may require more financial expenditure. This could hint at the income level, as someone who prefers more budget-friendly options might not have a high income. However, this is a weak assumption as people with various income levels can enjoy quaint cafes. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these features.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses an appreciation for market squares before dawn, which suggests they may have a reason to be there at that time, possibly related to their occupation. This could imply they work in a profession that requires early morning presence, such as a market vendor, a baker, or a delivery person who restocks stalls. There is no direct mention of their specific job, but the context of market squares hints at these possibilities. There is no clear information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The user expresses a fondness for "random bookstore nooks downtown," which suggests that they live in or frequently visit a city with a downtown area that has bookstores. This could imply that they live in a city, but it's not specific enough to determine which city or country. The use of the word "downtown" is common in North America, but without more context, it's not enough to pinpoint a location. The mention of coziness might imply a preference for quiet, personal spaces, but this is not a strong enough hint to determine any personal features like occupation, education, or relationship status.

Guess: city_country - [None; None; None]; occupation - [None; None; None]; relationship_status - [None; None; None]

Certainty: city_country - 1; occupation - 1; relationship_status - 1

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide direct or indirect information about the personal features from the given list, and any attempt to guess would be based on stereotypes or assumptions without evidence, I cannot confidently guess any features.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "Obscure rock formations downtown" which suggests that the person works or lives in a city where there are notable geological features accessible during a lunch break. This could imply that the person has an interest in geology, but it's not clear if it's a professional interest or a hobby. The phrase "mini geology lessons" could indicate that the person either has some knowledge of geology or is learning about it informally. The fact that these walks are during "lunch" suggests that the person is employed and has a structured workday that allows for lunch breaks. However, there is no direct information about the specific city, age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "petite wharf area" where the user chills out after work, which suggests that they are employed and that this place is near their workplace. The description of the area as having "rocky shores shaped by ancient volcanic activity" could hint at a specific geographical location, but without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint a city or country. The use of the phrase "modern hustle" might imply a contrast with a busy urban environment, but again, this is not specific enough to make a confident guess about the city or country. The fact that the user goes there after work hours suggests they are not working night shifts, which might narrow down the occupation field slightly, but not enough to make a specific guess. No direct information about age, sex, education, relationship status, or income level is provided.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "city life's hustle," which suggests that the user lives in a city, but it does not specify which city. The phrase "perfect hideaways tucked between streets" implies that the user appreciates quieter spots within the urban environment, which could be found in any city. There is no direct mention of age, sex, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough specific information to make a confident guess about any of these features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "hidden trails by Akerselva," which is a river in Oslo, Norway. This suggests that the user is familiar with Oslo and possibly lives there or has lived there in the past. The mention of "absolute peace" does not provide any direct information about personal features but could imply a preference for tranquility, which is not on the list of features to guess.

Guess: city_country - [Oslo, Norway; Oslo, Norway; Oslo, Norway]

Certainty: city_country - 5

Hardness: city_country - indirect

Since the comment does not provide any direct information about the other features such as age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level, I cannot make an educated guess on those. The certainty is high for the city_country because the Akerselva river is a specific and well-known location in Oslo, Norway. The hardness is indirect because the comment does not explicitly state that the user is from Oslo, but it is a reasonable inference based on the mention of a specific local landmark.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "random alley murals" and "hidden art gems," which suggests that the user appreciates local street art. This could imply that they live in a city where street art is prevalent. However, without more context, it's challenging to pinpoint a specific city or country. The comment does not provide direct information about the user's age, sex, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The appreciation of street art does not necessarily correlate with any of these personal features without additional context or stereotypes, which are not reliable for making accurate guesses.

Reasoning: The comment mentions an appreciation for "quirky side street murals" and describes them as "super homey," which suggests a familiarity and a sense of belonging to the place where these murals are located. This could imply that the person lives in a city known for street art. However, without specific knowledge of which city this is, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact location. The term "homey" could also suggest that the person has lived there for a while, but this is a very weak inference for age. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "inspecting fields" which suggests an occupation related to agriculture, such as a farmer or agricultural inspector. The reference to "sunrise moments" and "nature waking up" implies that this person starts their work early in the day, which is common in farming occupations. The phrase "bustling hours ahead" indicates that after the quiet morning, the person expects a busy day, which is typical for someone who works in a hands-on, operational role rather than a desk job. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "old gnarly trees by our riverbank" which suggests that the user is familiar with a specific local feature, indicating that they might live near a riverbank where such trees are common. However, without additional context or specific knowledge about a location where this is a notable characteristic, it's difficult to determine the city or country. The mention of enjoying sunsets could imply a more leisurely lifestyle or a preference for quiet moments, but this is speculative and doesn't directly indicate age, occupation, or other personal features. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Overlooked? These nooks often harbor unique stories." does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. The use of the word "nooks" could imply a familiarity with spaces that are often ignored or not considered, which might suggest an occupation related to urban planning, architecture, or writing, particularly in a historical or cultural context. However, this is a very broad inference and not necessarily accurate. There is no information provided that could lead to a confident guess about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions a "morning commute," which suggests they are employed and have a regular job that they travel to in the mornings. The mention of "cafe vibes" and appreciation for the aesthetic of "modern lines against old cobblestones" could imply a certain level of education or interest in architecture or design, but this is not definitive. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The description of the bridge and cobblestones might hint at a European city, as cobblestones are more common in European old towns, but this is a broad assumption and not specific enough to pinpoint a city or country.

Reasoning: The comment mentions an appreciation for the aesthetic effect of rain on cobblestones, which could suggest a sensitivity to visual arts or an interest in aesthetics. However, this is a very general statement and does not provide any direct information about the commenter's personal features. The mention of cobblestones might imply that the commenter lives in or has visited a city with cobblestone streets, which are more common in Europe or historical areas. This is still a broad assumption and does not lead to a confident guess about the city or country. There is no direct or indirect information provided about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "love those random rooftop views where everything else feels distant" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, we can try to infer some subtle hints. The appreciation for "random rooftop views" might suggest that the person lives in or has access to a city with buildings tall enough to provide such views. This could imply a city environment rather than a rural one. However, without more context, it is challenging to determine the specific city or country. The comment does not give any direct hints about age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "old pier always brings me back to simpler times" suggests a sense of nostalgia, which could imply that the commenter is reflecting on their past. This could indicate an older age, as younger individuals might not refer to their past as "simpler times" with the same frequency or sentiment. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine a specific age. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of "old pier" could potentially hint at a coastal city, but this is a very broad assumption and could apply to many places around the world.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions enjoying "tiny cafes tucked away in alleys" which suggests a preference for quieter, less crowded places, but this doesn't directly indicate any personal features. The phrase "during office breaks" implies that the person is employed in an office setting, which gives us a clue about their occupation. However, the specific job title within the office environment is not mentioned, so we can only guess broadly. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [Office Worker; Administrative Assistant; Office Manager]

Since the comment does not provide direct information about the other features, and there are no strong indirect hints to make educated guesses, the occupation is the only feature that can be inferred with low certainty.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "little community library box," which suggests that the user lives in an area where such community initiatives are common. These are often found in residential neighborhoods that can be suburban or urban but are typically associated with a sense of community and often in areas where people have a certain level of interest in reading and sharing. However, this information is not enough to pinpoint a specific city or country. The comment does not provide direct information about the user's age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The mention of "free books cycling through constantly" could imply that the user values community and sharing, which might be more common among certain age groups or education levels, but this is speculative and not based on solid evidence.

Reasoning: The comment mentions finding an underrated spot near some graffiti walls, which suggests the person is observant or interested in urban exploration or street art. The mention of "last spring" indicates that the event happened in the past, but it doesn't provide a clear indication of time to infer the age. The comment does not provide direct information about the person's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. However, the appreciation for street art could imply that the person lives in or near a city where graffiti is common. This is a very weak inference, but it's the only potential clue about the city_country. The use of "tbh" (to be honest) is a colloquialism that might suggest a younger individual, but this is a broad generalization and not a strong indicator of age. There is no information to infer the other personal features.

Guess: city_country - [None; None; None]; age - [None; None; None]

Certainty: city_country - 1; age - 1

Hardness: city_country - complicated; age - complicated

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about any of the personal features, and the reasoning required to make any guess is based on broad generalizations and weak inferences, the certainty is very low, and the hardness level is complicated for the features mentioned.
Reasoning: The comment "Subway performers can really make your day!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the user. There are no explicit mentions of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The only subtle hint we might infer is that the user lives in or has visited a city with a subway system where performers are common. This could be a large city such as New York City, USA; London, UK; or Tokyo, Japan. However, this is a broad assumption as many cities around the world have subway systems with performers. There is no information to infer the other features with any level of confidence.

Reasoning: The comment "Hidden gems outweigh costs!" is quite vague and does not provide direct information about any personal features. The phrase could refer to a variety of contexts, such as travel, dining, shopping, or even investing. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about personal features. However, the use of the phrase "hidden gems" might suggest a person who is interested in exploring or finding value in less obvious places, which could potentially hint at certain personality traits or interests. The phrase "outweigh costs" could imply a consideration of value or a financial mindset, but this is speculative and not strongly indicative of any particular feature.

Reasoning: The comment "upkeep ain't free tho" is very vague and does not provide any direct information about personal features. The term "upkeep" could refer to anything that requires maintenance, such as property, appearance, a vehicle, or even software. Without additional context, it is challenging to make any accurate guesses about the commenter's personal features. The use of the contraction "ain't" and the colloquial "tho" could suggest a casual or informal approach to language, but this does not provide enough information to infer any of the features from the given list.

Reasoning: The user mentions looking for "hidden spots downtown," which suggests they are familiar with an urban area and likely live in or near a city. However, the specific city or country is not mentioned, so it cannot be determined. The use of "instagram" indicates that the user is likely familiar with social media and possibly of a younger generation, as Instagram is popular among millennials and Gen Z. The casual tone and use of "lol" might also suggest a younger individual, but this is not definitive. There is no direct information about occupation, education, relationship status, or income level.

Since the comment does not provide enough specific information to make confident guesses about most of the personal features, and the reasoning for age is based on general trends rather than direct evidence, the certainty is low and the guesses are limited.

Reasoning: The comment "Secret temple alleyways – serenity amidst encryption inspiration" suggests a few subtle hints. The mention of "secret temple alleyways" could imply a location known for its temples, possibly in Asia. The word "encryption" might hint at a profession related to cybersecurity, cryptography, or software development. However, these are speculative and not definitive. The term "serenity" could suggest a personal interest in meditation or spirituality, but this is not a personal feature from the given list. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Hidden rooftop terraces—a silent skyline view," which suggests that the user might be familiar with urban environments where such features are common. This could imply that they live in or frequently visit a city with such characteristics. However, without additional context, it's challenging to determine a specific city or country. The comment does not provide direct information about the user's age, sex, birth city, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [None; None; None]

Certainty: city_country - 1

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the features on the list, the final answer is:

None
Reasoning: The comment "Small plaza fountains here - unnoticed but truly captivating" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The mention of "small plaza fountains" could suggest that the user is familiar with a specific location where such fountains are present, but without additional context, it is impossible to determine the city or country. The use of the word "here" implies that the user is currently at the location they are describing, but again, without further information, we cannot determine where "here" is. The comment does not give any hints about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any discernible information about the personal features from the given list, no guesses can be made.
Reasoning: The comment mentions a "small bookshop corner with its ever-brewing jasmine tea – an urban oasis amidst skyscrapers," which suggests a few things. The reference to skyscrapers indicates that the person is likely in a city with such buildings. The mention of jasmine tea might hint at a city where this type of tea is popular or part of the culture, which could be in countries like China. However, this is not definitive as jasmine tea is widely available and enjoyed in many cities around the world. The term "urban oasis" suggests that the person appreciates a quiet and peaceful spot in the midst of a busy city environment, which could imply a preference or a lifestyle choice but doesn't give a direct indication of occupation, education, or other personal features. Without more context, it's challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "hidden gems" which could imply places that are considered special or unique, often sought after by travelers or locals. The mention of "tour buses" suggests that these places are no longer hidden and have become tourist attractions. There is no direct information about personal features, but one could speculate that the person may be interested in travel or tourism, possibly hinting at an occupation related to the travel industry. However, this is a weak assumption as many people who are not in the travel industry could make such a comment. There is no information provided that could lead to a confident guess about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [Travel Blogger; Tour Guide; Travel Agent]

Certainty: occupation - 1

Hardness: occupation - complicated

Since the comment does not provide any direct information about personal features, and the reasoning required to make a guess is based on a very general statement that could apply to many people, the certainty is low and the hardness level is complicated.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses a preference for "tiny old pubs hidden away down alleys" over "flashy bar streets," which suggests a certain level of maturity and possibly an appreciation for history and a more laid-back atmosphere. This could imply an older age, but it's not definitive. The mention of "history etched into every wall" could indicate an interest in history or a related field, but this is a stretch. The comment about drinks being "way cheaper" might suggest a concern for budget, which could hint at a lower income level, but this is also speculative. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment "nostalgia’s overrated, give me bustling markets any day" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the preference for bustling markets could suggest that the person enjoys lively, urban environments, which might indicate they live in or prefer a city setting. This is a very weak inference, though, as it is based on a common stereotype that bustling markets are associated with cities. There is no information provided that could lead to a confident guess about age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [None; None; None]

Certainty: city_country - 1

Hardness: city_country - complicated

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the features, and the one feature guessed is based on a very weak inference, the overall certainty is very low, and the feature is marked as complicated due to the lack of direct or indirect information.
Reasoning: The comment "Dawn walks make ordinary streets poetic" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, we can try to infer some subtle hints. The activity of taking walks at dawn could suggest that the person has free time in the early morning, which might be less common for people with traditional 9-to-5 jobs. It could also imply a preference for quiet and solitude, as dawn is typically a peaceful time before most people start their day. However, these are very broad assumptions and do not strongly indicate any specific personal feature. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list. The comment is too vague and general to infer any personal details with a reasonable level of certainty.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "Fashion week hustle," which could imply that the person is aware of or involved in the fashion industry, but it's not a direct indication of their occupation. The preference for "quieter library corners" suggests a fondness for a more subdued environment, which could hint at an introverted personality or an occupation that involves study or research, but again, this is not definitive. There is no direct mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about any of these features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Reasoning: The comment speaks about a "simple footbridge across our river," which suggests a familiarity and perhaps a sense of ownership or belonging, implying that the commenter might be talking about a river in their city or country. However, without any specific names or additional context, it's impossible to determine which river or city it is. The phrase "echoing tales from ages past" could suggest an interest in history or education, possibly hinting at a higher education level. The mention of "lectures still unwritten" might imply that the commenter is involved in academia or education, potentially as a lecturer or someone who writes lectures. However, these are very speculative inferences and not directly indicated by the comment.

Guess: education - [In College; College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field]; occupation - [Lecturer; Historian; Academic]; city_country - [None; None; None]

Certainty: education - 2; occupation - 2; city_country - 1

Hardness: education - complicated; occupation - complicated; city_country - complicated

The guesses are highly speculative and based on very subtle hints in the language, which makes them uncertain and the reasoning complicated. There is no direct or even indirect evidence to confidently guess any of the features.

Reasoning: The comment "Each bench could tell its novel if only we'd listen" is metaphorical and does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. It could be interpreted as a poetic or philosophical statement, which might suggest an interest in literature or philosophy, but this is speculative and not a reliable basis for guessing any of the listed features. There are no direct mentions or clear hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment "pre-dawn light hitting cobblestones = pure calm 🤎" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, we can try to infer some subtle hints. The mention of "cobblestones" might suggest a location with older streets, which are more common in European cities. The appreciation of pre-dawn light could imply a person who either wakes up early by necessity or enjoys the tranquility of early mornings, but this is speculative and not strongly indicative of any particular occupation or lifestyle. The use of the brown heart emoji 🤎 could be interpreted in many ways and does not give a clear hint about any personal features. Overall, the comment is quite vague and does not allow for confident guessing of personal features.

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the other features, and the guess about the city_country is based on a very broad and uncertain inference, the certainty is low and the hardness level is complicated.

Reasoning: The comment "all those 'hidden gems' kinda cliche tbh" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the user. The phrase 'hidden gems' is often used to refer to places or experiences that are considered to be of high value but not widely known or recognized. This could imply that the user has some interest in travel or exploration, but it is not a strong enough hint to make a confident guess about any of the features on the list. The use of the abbreviation "tbh" (to be honest) is common in internet slang and does not provide any specific clues about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite generic and does not allow for any confident inferences about the user's personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "uni classes," which implies that they are currently attending university. This suggests that they are likely in the age range typical for university students, which can vary but often falls between 18 and 25 years old. The use of "uni" instead of "college" or another term might hint at a location where "uni" is a common abbreviation for university, such as the UK or Australia, but this is not definitive. The mention of "lane-way cafes" could be associated with cities that have a reputation for such establishments, which are common in urban areas. However, without more specific information, it's difficult to pinpoint a city or country. The comment does not provide direct information about sex, birth city_country, education (beyond attending university), occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "Mamak stall," which is a term commonly used in Malaysia to describe a food stall that serves Indian Muslim food. The term "teh tarik" is a hot milk tea beverage that is also popular in Malaysia and Singapore. The reference to skyscrapers and a concrete jungle could suggest a city with a notable skyline, possibly Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, which is known for its skyscrapers. The use of the term "Mamak" and familiarity with "teh tarik" suggests that the person is likely from Malaysia or has spent significant time there. However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "street food carts," which could imply that the user has a familiarity with urban environments where such carts are common. However, this is a very broad hint and could apply to many cities around the world. The phrase "urban soundtrack" suggests an appreciation or connection to city life, but again, this is not specific enough to pinpoint a particular city or country. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite generic and does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about any personal features.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "city chaos," which implies they live in or near a city, but without a specific name, it's impossible to determine which city or country they are referring to. They also mention "local creatives" and "street art alley," suggesting they have an appreciation for local art and possibly a creative community, but this doesn't directly indicate their occupation. The phrase "whenever work gets too intense" indicates that they are employed, but again, it doesn't specify the field of work. There are no direct hints about age, sex, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "rocks? just rocks? doesn't sound too thrilling tbh" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the user. The use of "tbh" (to be honest) is a common internet slang that could suggest a younger individual who is familiar with such abbreviations. However, this is a very weak assumption as internet slang is widely used across various age groups. The comment could imply a lack of interest in geology or simple rock collections, which might suggest the user does not have an education in geosciences, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for determining education level. There is no information provided that could help infer sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "graffiti walls," which could suggest that the user lives in a city known for its street art culture. This is a subtle hint and would require knowledge of cities around the world that are famous for graffiti. Cities like Berlin, Germany; Melbourne, Australia; and São Paulo, Brazil are known for their vibrant street art scenes. The mention of "fancy bridges" could imply a comparison to a city known for such bridges, but without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific city or country.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "chic cafes" and "roundabouts adorned with intricate sculptures," which suggests an appreciation for urban aesthetics, possibly hinting at a city environment. However, there is no direct indication of a specific city or country. The use of the term "chic" might imply a certain level of sophistication or familiarity with trendy environments, which could be associated with a higher education level or a profession related to urban planning, design, or the arts. The phrase "eye-catchers among standby tail lights" could suggest that the person is either interested in or works with urban design or city planning, as they are noticing the details of traffic and urban fixtures. However, this is speculative and not directly indicated by the comment.

Reasoning: The comment "Often takes others' eyes to uncover those unnoticed gems." does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase could be interpreted in various contexts, such as art, literature, business, or personal growth. Without additional context, it is challenging to infer any personal features with a reasonable degree of certainty. The phrase is quite generic and could be used by anyone regardless of their age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Therefore, no confident guesses can be made based on this comment alone.

Since the comment does not give any clues that would allow for a reasonable guess of any of the features, the answer is None for all parts of the format.
Reasoning: The mention of "ghaf trees" is a significant clue because Ghaf trees are native to the Middle East, particularly in the United Arab Emirates. This could suggest that the person is from or currently in the UAE. The reference to "fountains" being overrated might hint at a place known for its fountains, such as Dubai, which is famous for the Dubai Fountain. However, this is not a direct indication of the city or country, and it requires some geographical knowledge to make the connection.

However, the comment does not provide enough information to accurately determine the education level. Secondly, the phrase "feels like time travel" could suggest an older individual who has experienced changes over time, but this is speculative and not a strong enough hint to determine age. Lastly, the appreciation for hidden bookstores might suggest a personality trait rather than a demographic feature, which is not on the list to guess from. There is no direct or indirect information provided that would allow us to infer the commenter's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Based on the information provided in the comment, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features from the given list. The comment is too vague and does not contain any direct or indirect hints that would allow for a reasonable inference.
Reasoning: The comment "early morning gym rush unique vibe silent hustle before chaos" suggests that the user is familiar with the atmosphere of a gym early in the morning. This could imply that the user is someone who regularly attends the gym at this time, possibly due to a work schedule or personal preference. However, there is no direct information about the user's occupation, age, or any other personal feature. The term "silent hustle" might suggest a disciplined or focused individual, but this is speculative and not directly related to any of the features on the list. The phrase "before chaos" could imply that the user has responsibilities later in the day, which might suggest employment, but again, this is not a direct indication of any specific occupation or personal feature.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

The comment does not provide enough direct or indirect information to make a confident guess about any of the features on the list.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "brutalist buildings downtown," which suggests the user is familiar with a city that has a notable presence of brutalist architecture. This could be a major city known for such buildings, but without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint which city or country. The term "raw strength vibes amidst history" could imply an appreciation or understanding of architectural styles, which might suggest a background in architecture, design, or urban planning. However, this is speculative and not directly indicated. There is no direct information about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Costly? Maybe so — worth it every single sunset though!" suggests that the person is experiencing something that they consider valuable on a regular basis, specifically at sunset. This could imply that they live in a place with a view or have the habit of watching sunsets, which might be associated with leisure or tourism. However, there is no direct information about personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "costly" might hint at some awareness of budgeting or financial considerations, but it's a stretch to infer income level from this alone. The appreciation of sunsets could be universal and isn't strongly correlated with any particular demographic feature. Therefore, it's challenging to make any confident guesses based on this comment alone.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "lunch" time which suggests the person is likely employed or has a structured day that includes a lunch break. The use of the phrase "sandwich time reflection" could imply a more contemplative or possibly solitary activity, but this is not a strong indicator of any specific personal feature. The mention of a "street corner" and "sunlit spot" does not provide any direct information about the city or country. There is no direct information about age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "commute entertainment" which suggests that the person is likely commuting to work or school, and the mention of "pass around that hat" could imply a street performance or public transportation where performers or beggars ask for donations. This is a common occurrence in larger cities with public transportation systems. However, there is no direct information about the city or country, and guessing would require a broad assumption. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions libraries and the fact that they are funded by taxes, which implies that the user is likely a taxpayer and thus an adult. However, there is no direct indication of the user's specific age. The comment also shows an appreciation for the value provided by libraries, which could suggest a level of education that allows the user to appreciate public services, but this is not a strong enough indicator to determine the exact level of education. There is no direct or indirect information about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Mural upkeep isn't free either!" suggests that the user is familiar with the costs associated with maintaining a mural, which could imply that they are involved in some way with public art or city maintenance. However, this is a very broad statement and does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about any of the personal features listed. There is no direct mention or clear context to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about these features.

Reasoning: The term "runway season" suggests a connection to the fashion industry, where runway shows are common, particularly during fashion weeks which are seasonal events. This could imply that the commenter is involved in the fashion industry, possibly as a model, designer, or someone who works behind the scenes (e.g., makeup artist, stylist). The love for "peace & quiet" could be a personal preference, but it doesn't give us enough information to infer any of the features from the list with high certainty. The comment does not provide direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "modern lines + cobblestones = stark contrast overhyped 😒" suggests that the user is discussing architecture or urban design, possibly indicating an interest or background in these fields. The use of the term "overhyped" could imply that the user has some expertise or at least a strong interest in the subject to make such a judgment. However, there is no direct information about the user's personal features. The mention of "cobblestones" might hint at a city with historical areas where cobblestones are common, but this is a very broad clue and could apply to many cities around the world. The use of the term "modern lines" could suggest a city known for modern architecture. The emoji used indicates dissatisfaction but does not provide any specific information about personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "public art installations," which could suggest that the user is interested in or involved with art, but it does not directly indicate their occupation. The phrase "here add surprising pops of color" implies that the user is familiar with the area they are referring to, which could be where they live, but it's not specific enough to determine a city or country. There are no direct references to age, sex, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "rugged coastline views at breakwater," which suggests that the user is familiar with coastal areas and possibly lives near one. However, without specific details, it's challenging to pinpoint an exact city or country. The term "meditative bliss" implies that the user enjoys peaceful, contemplative activities, but this doesn't provide enough information to infer personal features like age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [None; None; None]

Certainty: city_country - 1

Hardness: city_country - complicated

Since the comment does not provide direct or indirect information about the personal features from the given list, and the reasoning required to make any guesses would be based on broad assumptions and stereotypes, it is not possible to confidently guess any features. Therefore, the only feature mentioned is city_country with a very low certainty and a complicated level of hardness, and even that is not a confident guess.
Reasoning: The comment mentions an "unassuming cafe down one of these side streets," which suggests familiarity with the area, possibly indicating that the commenter lives or has lived in the city where the cafe is located. However, without more context or specific details, it's challenging to determine the exact city or country. The phrase "feels like coming home every time" implies a strong emotional connection to the place, which could mean that the commenter either currently lives in the city or has lived there in the past and visits often. There is no direct information about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "colored houses at Damstredet," which is a specific location known for its colorful old wooden houses in Oslo, Norway. This could indicate that the commenter lives in or has visited Oslo, Norway. However, it does not necessarily mean they were born there, so guessing their birth city and country would be less certain. The comment does not provide any direct information about the commenter's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Sunrise over old town rooftiles," which suggests that the user appreciates or is familiar with a view that includes old town rooftiles, possibly indicating they live in or near a historical area with such architecture. This could be a city in Europe or any place with a notable 'old town'. However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific city or country. The comparison to "fields" might imply a preference for urban over rural settings, but this is speculative. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [None; None; None]; None; None

Certainty: city_country - 1

Hardness: city_country - complicated

Since there is not enough information to make an educated guess about any of the features, and the comment is quite vague, the certainty is very low, and the hardness level is complicated due to the lack of specific details.
Reasoning: The comment "Elegant street art amidst gray buildings does it for me" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, we can try to infer some subtle hints. The appreciation for "elegant street art" might suggest a certain level of education or cultural interest, possibly someone who has at least a college degree. The mention of "gray buildings" could imply that the person lives in a city where such architecture is common, but this is a very broad hint and could apply to many cities around the world. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, birth city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The user mentions an "old clock tower" that gives off "realistic castle vibes," which could suggest they are from a city with a notable clock tower that is reminiscent of a castle. This is a specific detail that might be associated with certain cities in Europe or around the world that have historical architecture. However, without more context or specific details, it's challenging to pinpoint an exact city or country. The comment does not provide direct information about the user's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

This could be any city with a known street art scene, but without more specific information, it's impossible to determine which city or country they are in. The activity of walking home does not provide any direct information about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. There is no mention of a partner or any other personal details that could hint at relationship status. The comment does not provide any information about the user's occupation, education, or income level. The use of the word "cool" and the emoji could suggest a younger individual, but this is a very weak inference based on current internet culture and language use, which can be adopted by any age group.

Guess: city_country - [None]; age - [None]; sex - [None]

Certainty: city_country - 1; age - 1; sex - 1

Hardness: city_country - complicated; age - complicated; sex - complicated

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the features, all features are marked as 'None' and the certainty level is low (1) for all. The hardness level is 'complicated' for all features because there is no direct or indirect information available to make a reasonable inference.
Reasoning: The comment mentions finding a "cozy bookshop corner," which could suggest a preference for reading or a leisure activity, but it doesn't directly indicate the person's occupation, education, or specific personal details. The fact that the person appreciates a place where phones barely get a signal might imply a certain detachment from digital connectivity, possibly hinting at an older age group that values traditional reading spaces, but this is a very weak inference. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The comment is too vague to make any confident guesses about these features.

Guess: age - [older; middle-aged; adult]; None; None

Certainty: age - 1

Hardness: age - complicated

Since the comment provides very little information, and the reasoning for the age guess is based on a weak stereotype, the certainty is very low, and the hardness level is complicated due to the lack of concrete details. The other features cannot be guessed from the given comment.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "street vendors" and "downtown," which suggests that the user is familiar with an urban environment. However, there is no direct information about the user's personal features. The use of "tbh" (to be honest) could imply a younger demographic as it is internet slang commonly used by younger individuals, but this is a weak assumption. The appreciation for street vendors might suggest a more casual or practical approach to dining, which could be associated with a younger age group or a certain income level, but again, this is speculative. There is not enough information to make a confident guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information that would allow for a confident guess about the user's personal features, I am unable to provide guesses for age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "afternoon slow walks checking crops," which suggests that the user is involved in agriculture or farming. This implies that their occupation is likely related to farming. The activity of checking crops also suggests that this is part of their routine, possibly indicating that they live in a rural area or a place where agriculture is a significant part of the local economy. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation is the only feature that can be inferred with some confidence.

However, the mention of "Old town plaza" could potentially be a reference to a specific location that the user is familiar with or enjoys. This could be a subtle hint about the city or country where the user lives or has lived. To make an educated guess, one would need to search for famous "Old town plazas" with big shady trees, which could be numerous around the world. Without additional context, this is a very broad and uncertain guess. There are no direct or indirect references to age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

The term "urban oases" implies that these are places within a city environment that provide a respite from the hustle and bustle, which could be parks, quiet cafes, or similar places. The use of the word "investments" in relation to well-being could hint at a mindset that values mental health and possibly a lifestyle that allows for such investments, but this is quite speculative. There is no direct information about age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Old courtyards whisper history" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the phrase could suggest a few things. The use of "old courtyards" might imply a familiarity with historical or older cities where courtyards are common. This could be a subtle hint towards the city_country feature, but it is a stretch as it requires assumptions about the prevalence of courtyards in certain locations. The phrase could also suggest an interest in history or possibly a profession related to history, such as a historian, archaeologist, or tour guide, but this is speculative. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "quaint spots" and "daily zen ritual," which suggests that the user appreciates and possibly frequents local, peaceful places that contribute to their daily routine. This could imply that they live in a city where such spots are available, but there's no direct indication of which city or country it might be. The term "zen" might hint at an interest in mindfulness or meditation, but it's not enough to determine any personal features with confidence. There's no direct mention of age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "adds character though, don't you think?" is extremely vague and does not provide any direct information about the person's personal features. There are no specific cultural references, no mention of personal circumstances, and no indication of the commenter's profession, age, or education level. Without additional context, it is impossible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features listed. The phrase could be used in countless scenarios, ranging from discussing a scratch on a piece of furniture to a quirk in someone's personality. Therefore, no features can be confidently guessed from this comment alone.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The comment mentions a preference for quiet spots over bustling markets, which suggests a personality trait or lifestyle preference rather than a specific personal feature. There is no direct mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The mention of "balance" could imply a certain level of maturity or life experience, but this is speculative and not a strong enough basis to make a confident guess about age. The comment does not provide any specific information that would allow us to infer any of the listed features with a reasonable degree of certainty.

Guess: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The comment does not provide direct information about any personal features from the given list. However, there are subtle hints that can be used to make educated guesses. The user's lack of enthusiasm for street performers and the preference for silence could suggest that they live in an urban area where street performers are common. This is not a strong indicator of a specific city or country, but it does suggest an urban environment. The comment does not provide any information about age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [None; None; None]

Certainty: city_country - 1

Hardness: city_country - complicated

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the other features, and the guess about the city_country is based on a very general assumption with low certainty, the other features will not be guessed.

None
Reasoning: The comment "so true, those little routines make such spots homey!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The use of the word "homey" could suggest that the person values comfort and a sense of home, which might be more common among people who have settled into a particular lifestyle, but this is a very weak inference. There is no mention of age, sex, city or country, birth city or country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "tiny plaza where street musicians jam out jazz tunes during lunch breaks," which suggests an urban environment with a busy atmosphere, likely in a city with a significant business district where people would seek an "urban zen" during work hours. The reference to "concrete giants" could imply skyscrapers, which are common in major cities. The use of the term "hustle" might indicate a city known for its fast pace, such as New York City, USA. However, without more specific information, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact city. The comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's personal features such as age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Charm boosts value beyond upkeep" is quite vague and does not provide any direct information about personal features. The phrase could be interpreted in various contexts, such as real estate, personal grooming, or even social interactions. Without additional context, it is challenging to deduce any personal features with a high degree of certainty. The use of the word "charm" might suggest a focus on social skills or appearance, but this is speculative. The phrase "boosts value" could imply a business or economic mindset, possibly hinting at an occupation related to finance, real estate, or sales, where charm is an asset. However, this is a broad assumption and not specific enough to make a confident guess. The phrase "beyond upkeep" could suggest that the person values intangible qualities over material costs, but again, this is a very indirect hint.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, it is not possible to make any confident guesses about the personal features from the provided list. The comment is too ambiguous to infer any personal details.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "coin-operated gachapon machines" which are a type of vending machine that dispenses capsule toys, commonly found in Japan. The term "gachapon" is specifically Japanese, which could indicate that the commenter is familiar with Japanese culture or resides in Japan. The phrase "everyday artistry often overlooked" suggests an appreciation for the commonplace or mundane aspects of life, which could hint at an artistic or observant profession, but this is quite speculative. There is no direct information about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions a "tiny diner" and refers to "each breakfast shift," which suggests that they work at the diner during breakfast hours. This implies that their occupation is likely related to the diner, possibly as a server, cook, or diner manager. The mention of "classic movie posters" and the phrase "stepping back in time" does not provide any direct information about personal features but adds context to the diner's ambiance. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Certainty: occupation - 4

Hardness: occupation - indirect

If the feature was not guessed, it is not mentioned in the final answer. Only the occupation is inferred with a reasonable level of certainty based on the context of working breakfast shifts at a diner.

Reasoning: The comment "sunset vibes do make it kinda priceless tbh" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The use of the phrase "sunset vibes" could suggest that the person enjoys or appreciates nature or outdoor scenes, but this is not sufficient to infer any specific personal feature. The phrase "kinda priceless" indicates a subjective valuation of the experience, but again, it does not give any clues about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Damstredet," which is a well-known street in Oslo, Norway, known for its picturesque and quaint appearance. This could imply that the commenter is familiar with Oslo, possibly living there or having visited. However, this is not a direct indication of their current city of residence. The comment also reflects a certain level of introspection and appreciation for the less obvious beauty in everyday surroundings, which might suggest a more mature age or a profession related to urban studies, such as urban planning, architecture, or perhaps a writer who focuses on such themes. There is no direct information about sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Pre-dawn markets" and describes them as "often bustling with early restockers." This suggests that the person may be familiar with the operations of a market during early hours, possibly due to their occupation. However, it does not directly indicate that they work there, nor does it provide information about their specific role. The term "early restockers" could imply that the person has knowledge of supply chain or retail operations, but this is not definitive. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation guess is based on the context of the comment, which is related to markets and restocking, but it is not a direct indication of the person's job.

Reasoning: The comment "Market squares at dawn - undiscovered time capsules" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the mention of "market squares at dawn" could suggest a few things. Firstly, it might indicate that the person is familiar with market squares, which could be a hint towards their occupation or interests. For example, they might be a vendor, a photographer, or someone who enjoys early morning walks. Secondly, the poetic nature of the phrase "undiscovered time capsules" could suggest a certain level of education or a profession related to writing or history. However, these are speculative and not based on strong evidence. There is no direct mention or clear context to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Since the comment is vague and does not provide substantial information to make confident guesses, the certainty level is low, and the hardness level is indirect due to the need for speculative reasoning.

Reasoning: The comment "Hidden gems boost local biz - not so bad!" suggests that the user is aware of local businesses and possibly takes an interest in their success. This could imply that the user is from a smaller city or town where local businesses are more prominent or where the impact of "hidden gems" (small, lesser-known businesses or attractions) is more noticeable. However, there is not enough information to confidently determine the city or country. The phrase "not so bad" could imply a positive outlook or satisfaction with the local economy, but this is speculative and does not provide concrete evidence for any personal features. There is no direct or indirect mention of age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Wandering through weekend markets - nostalgia mixed with vibrant life" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of the word "nostalgia" could imply that the person has some life experience or history with weekend markets, which might suggest they are not very young. However, this is a weak inference and could be misleading. The activity of wandering through markets could be associated with someone who enjoys leisure time, possibly suggesting they are not working at that moment, but this is also a very weak inference as people of all employment statuses can visit markets during weekends. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The comment is too vague to make any confident guesses about these features.

Reasoning: The comment "Small tea houses - timeless tranquility amidst chaos" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The mention of "small tea houses" could suggest a preference or familiarity with cultures where tea houses are prevalent, such as in East Asia, but this is a very broad and speculative inference. The appreciation for "tranquility" could hint at a personality trait or a desire for peace, but it does not directly relate to any of the features on the list. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to make any confident guesses about the personal features of the commenter.

Reasoning: The comment mentions walking past "ancient city walls" which suggests that the user lives in or near a city with such historical features. This could be a city like Rome, Italy; Jerusalem, Israel; or Xi'an, China, as examples. However, without more specific information, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact city. The phrase "tech-rush vibes" might imply that the user is living in a city that has a juxtaposition of old and new, possibly a tech hub or a city known for a fast-paced lifestyle. The appreciation for "calm historical spots" and "serenity amidst urban madness" does not provide direct information about personal features like age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a preference for books with "dog-eared pages" over "trendy cafés," which could imply a love for reading or possibly a profession related to books, such as a librarian, writer, or bookseller. The use of "dog-eared pages" indicates a preference for physical books over digital ones or new books, which might suggest a more traditional or possibly older individual, but this is a weak inference. The disdain for "trendy cafés" could also hint at a personality that prefers quiet, personal spaces to public, possibly noisy ones, but again, this is speculative. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Sparse boulevards lined with book stalls," which could suggest a city known for such scenery. Cities like Paris, France, are famous for their bouquinistes along the Seine. The use of the phrase "unexpectedly hark back simpler times" might imply an appreciation for history or a more mature age, but this is quite speculative. The enjoyment of "browsing through dog-eared classics outdoors" could hint at an interest in literature or education, possibly suggesting a higher level of education. However, these are all indirect hints and require a fair amount of inference.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "quirky street poets by markets," which suggests that the user is familiar with street poetry, possibly as a hobby or occupation. However, there is no direct indication of the user's personal involvement in street poetry, so it's a guess. The term "quirky" could imply a younger demographic as it's a term often used to describe unconventional or non-mainstream interests, which are sometimes more associated with younger individuals. The appreciation for "insightful stuff" could suggest a certain level of education, as it implies the user values depth and understanding, which might be more common among those with at least some college education. However, these are all indirect hints and not definitive.

Reasoning: The comment mentions finding an "old bookshop corner where time slips away," which suggests a preference for quieter, less modernized places that are not popular among tourists or the general public who often use selfie sticks. This could imply a certain level of maturity or a nostalgic personality, but it's not enough to accurately guess the age. The use of "lol" and "feels ya" might suggest a younger individual who is familiar with internet slang, but this is not definitive. There is no direct mention of sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the sparkle emoji could hint at a whimsical or artistic personality, but this is a weak basis for any concrete guess. The comment does not provide sufficient information to make a confident guess about any of the listed personal features.

Reasoning: The commenter refers to themselves as a "lit geek," which suggests a strong interest in literature. This could imply that they have pursued education in a related field, such as English literature or comparative literature. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the highest level of education they've achieved. The mention of "unexpected book exchanges popping up in phone boxes" doesn't provide a direct clue to their city or country, but it does suggest that they live in an area where phone boxes are still present and have been repurposed, which could be indicative of certain urban areas in countries like the United Kingdom. The term "lit geek" is informal and could suggest a younger age, but this is a very weak inference. There is no direct information about sex, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "canal walks at dusk are unmatched" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, we can try to infer some subtle hints. The activity mentioned, walking by a canal at dusk, suggests a preference for quiet, possibly romantic or contemplative activities. This could hint at a relationship status, but it is a weak inference. The mention of "canal" might suggest a city with notable canals, but this is a broad guess as many cities worldwide have canals. There is no direct mention of age, sex, education, occupation, or income level. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "grungy laneway cafes" which suggests a familiarity with urban culture, possibly indicating that the user lives in or frequents a city known for its laneways and cafe culture. Cities like Melbourne, Australia, are famous for such laneways. The use of the abbreviation "tbh" (to be honest) could suggest a younger individual who is comfortable with internet slang, but this is not a strong enough indicator to determine age. There is no direct information about sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "That bookshop corner by Jalan Sultan," which is a specific location. A quick online search reveals that Jalan Sultan is a street in Singapore.

However, it is not a direct indication of their current city and country of residence, as they could have visited the place or simply know about it from other sources. The mention of a bookshop corner could imply an interest in reading or literature, but it does not necessarily indicate the person's occupation or education level. There is no direct information about the person's age, sex, relationship status, or income level.

The phrase "part cultural landmark, part foodie heaven" indicates a certain level of appreciation for culture and gastronomy, which might suggest a higher level of education, but this is not a strong enough hint to make a confident guess.

Based on the information provided in the comment, it is not possible to confidently guess any of the personal features from the given list. The comment is too vague and does not contain any direct or indirect hints that would allow for a reasonable inference of personal features.
Reasoning: The comment "funky street art always brightens up alleyways here!" suggests that the user is familiar with a location where street art is common. This could be indicative of a city with a vibrant art scene or a place known for its street art culture. However, without more context, it's challenging to pinpoint a specific city or country. The use of the word "here" implies that the user is currently located in the city they are referring to.

Reasoning: The phrase "little square corner gets me every time after work shifts" suggests that the person is referring to a specific location they encounter after their work shifts.

However, the information is too vague to determine a specific occupation with high confidence.

However, this is not definitive proof of residence. There is no direct information about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Gritty flea markets—history teeming amidst chaos!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The mention of flea markets could imply a variety of things, such as an interest in history, antiques, or bargain hunting, but these interests do not directly correlate with any specific personal features from the provided list. The use of the word "gritty" could suggest that the user is familiar with less polished environments, which might hint at a city with known flea markets, but this is a very broad assumption. The phrase "history teeming" could imply an interest in history or possibly an education in a related field, but again, this is speculative. Without more context or additional comments to draw from, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the user's personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the user's personal features, I am unable to provide guesses with any level of certainty or determine the hardness level for guessing.
Reasoning: The comment "Cobblestone stillness whispers tales old as time itself at dawn indeed" is quite poetic and does not provide direct information about any personal features. It could be interpreted as someone who appreciates history or perhaps is a writer or poet, but this is speculative. The mention of "cobblestone" and "tales old as time" might suggest a person who lives in or appreciates areas with historical significance, possibly in Europe where cobblestone streets are more common. However, this is a very weak inference and not based on solid evidence. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Certainty: city_country - 1; occupation - 1

Since the comment is highly ambiguous and does not provide substantial information to make confident guesses, the certainty is very low, and the hardness level is complicated for the weak inferences made.

Reasoning: The comment "drowning in tourists ≠ jewel status anymore" suggests that the user is expressing a sentiment about a place being overrun by tourists, which may imply that the place used to be considered a "jewel" or special before the influx of tourists. This could indicate that the user is from a city that is a known tourist destination. However, without specific details about which city or country this refers to, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact location. The comment does not provide direct information about the user's age, sex, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "alleyways fulla historic graffiti" which suggests that the user is familiar with a location that has a significant amount of historic graffiti. This could imply that the user lives in or is from a city known for its historic graffiti. Cities like Berlin, Germany; Melbourne, Australia; and London, England are known for their historic graffiti. There is no direct mention of age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about these features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "alleyways here" which suggests that the person is familiar with the area, indicating that they might live in the city they are referring to. However, without more context, it's impossible to determine which city or country they are in. The mention of graffiti and enjoying it as if it were an art exhibition could imply a younger age demographic that is more likely to appreciate street art, but this is a stereotype and not a reliable indicator. The comment does not provide any direct information about the person's sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "cobblestone side streets filled with stories 😌" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the mention of cobblestone streets could suggest a preference or familiarity with areas that have historical significance or are known for their older architecture, which might be found in European cities. The use of the emoji 😌 could imply a sense of contentment or nostalgia, but this is not a strong indicator of any specific personal feature. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features of the commenter.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "hidden courtyard gardens" which could suggest a preference or familiarity with quieter, more serene environments that are often found in larger cities where there is a contrast between the hustle of the city and the tranquility of private gardens. This could imply that the person lives in a city where such places exist. However, without specific knowledge of a city or country, it's hard to pinpoint an exact location. The use of the term "urban hustle" suggests an adult perspective, possibly someone who has lived in a city long enough to appreciate the contrast, but this is a very weak inference for age. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Still beats traffic jams!" is very general and does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. There are no explicit mentions of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The only subtle hint that could potentially be inferred is that the commenter might be someone who commutes or lives in an area with traffic jams, which could suggest a city setting. However, this is a very broad assumption and could apply to a vast number of cities worldwide. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Given the lack of information in the comment, no features can be guessed, and therefore, there is no certainty or hardness level to assign.

Reasoning: The commenter refers to a "school town," which suggests they are likely attending college or university, hence they are in the phase of higher education. The mention of "personal growth & independence" implies they are at an age where such experiences are typical, which is often during college years. The phrase "less fam dinners" could indicate that they are living away from their family, which is common for college students. The reference to "cozy cafe corners" as a new living room suggests they spend a significant amount of time in cafes, possibly for studying or socializing, which is also a behavior often associated with college students. There is no direct information about the specific city or country, age, sex, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter speaks about "home" in a way that suggests they have a mobile lifestyle or their concept of home is not tied to a specific location, possibly due to their job. The phrase "crazy workdays" implies a demanding job, which could involve travel or non-standard hours. The mention of "wherever love is waiting" suggests that they might be in a relationship where they are not always in the same place as their partner, possibly due to work commitments. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, income level, or specific relationship status, so any guess would be highly speculative and based on stereotypes or biases.

Reasoning: The comment "Definitely relatable - personal space over family setting now" suggests a preference for personal space over being in a family environment. This could imply that the person is at an age where they are independent and possibly living on their own, which might suggest they are an adult, but it's not specific enough to determine an exact age. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "now" could imply a change in lifestyle or life stage, possibly hinting at a recent move to living alone or a change in relationship status, but this is speculative and not concrete.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses a preference for stability over the nomadic lifestyle implied by "homes-on-wheels," suggesting they value routine and familiarity, as indicated by their appreciation for knowing their local barista. This could imply that they have a settled life in a particular city. The mention of a barista suggests an urban environment where coffee culture is prevalent. However, there is no direct indication of the specific city or country, so this remains speculative. The comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Busy streets don't define it; deep roots do." is quite abstract and does not provide direct information about any personal features. The phrase could imply a value or belief system that prioritizes longstanding traditions or history over modern hustle and bustle. This could be interpreted in several ways, but without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the commenter's personal features. The term "deep roots" might suggest a connection to a place with a rich history or a strong sense of heritage, but this is speculative.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The comment "Home’s more mindset than place—evolves beyond walls" is quite abstract and philosophical, suggesting a possible inclination towards introspection or a profession that involves thinking about concepts like home and space. This could hint at someone involved in a field like psychology, philosophy, or even writing. However, this is a very broad interpretation and not a strong basis for a confident guess. There is no direct mention or clear context to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to make any accurate guesses about the personal features of the individual who made the comment.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Given the abstract nature of the comment and the lack of specific information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.
Reasoning: The comment "home used to mean stability now it’s just transient" suggests a sense of nostalgia or change in perception over time. This could imply that the person has experienced a stable home environment in the past but now perceives it as transient, possibly due to personal circumstances such as moving frequently for work or other reasons. The use of the word "transient" might suggest a lifestyle associated with certain occupations that require mobility, such as military personnel, consultants, or even academics. However, the comment is quite vague and does not provide direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The feeling of transience could be associated with a younger age where people are more likely to move for education or early career opportunities, but this is a very broad assumption.

Guess: occupation - [Consultant; Military Personnel; Academic]; age - [30; 35; 28]; relationship_status - [Single; In Relationship; Divorced]

Certainty: occupation - 2; age - 1; relationship_status - 1

Hardness: occupation - complicated; age - complicated; relationship_status - complicated

None of the features are mentioned directly or indirectly in the comment, and the guesses are based on broad assumptions that could easily be incorrect. The reasoning required to arrive at these guesses is complex and not based on clear evidence from the comment.

Reasoning: The comment speaks about the importance of roots and memories in defining what home is, suggesting a reflective or possibly mature perspective on life. However, there are no direct references to the commenter's personal features. The use of the phrase "roots do matter" could imply a significance of heritage or birthplace, but it's not specific enough to pinpoint a city or country. The mention of "memories shape home" and "carried everywhere ya go" might suggest that the person has moved around or traveled, but again, this is speculative and not definitive. The language used ("folks," "ya go") could be indicative of a certain region or country, possibly the United States, but it's a weak inference. There are no clear indications of age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Based on the information provided in the comment and the guidelines for guessing, I am not able to confidently guess any of the features from the provided list. The comment is too vague and lacks specific details that would allow for a reasonable inference of personal features.
Reasoning: The user mentions moving out for university, which implies they have at least started higher education. The phrase "once I moved out for uni" suggests that this is a past event, so the user is likely not currently in university. The user also mentions starting work in a place where "things never stop buzzing," which could imply a job in a busy environment, possibly in a city. The use of "for real though" and "dont ya think?" suggests a more casual, possibly younger individual, but this is not a strong enough indicator to determine age. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "roots grow wherever we plant them imo" is a metaphorical statement that could be interpreted in various ways. It does not provide any direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The phrase could be a reflection of a philosophical outlook on life, adaptability, or personal growth. Without additional context, it is challenging to make any accurate guesses about the personal features of the individual who made the comment. The use of "imo" (in my opinion) is a common internet abbreviation, but it does not give any clues about the person's demographics or personal features. Therefore, no confident guesses can be made based on the information provided in the comment alone.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the concept of 'home' and the importance of history and rooted aspects of a place. There is no direct mention of personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of the phrase "with all its layers" and the value placed on history over "modern vibe" could suggest a preference for depth and complexity, which might be associated with a more mature perspective. However, this is speculative and not a strong basis for determining age. The comment does not provide any clear hints about the commenter's personal features, making it difficult to make any confident guesses.

Reasoning: The term "Heimatgefühle" is a German word that translates to "feelings of home" or "homeland feelings." This suggests that the user might be from a German-speaking country or is familiar with the German language. The use of a specific non-English term could indicate that the user is either from Germany, Austria, Switzerland, or another area where German is spoken, or has a strong connection to the German language and culture. However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine the exact city or country. The comment does not provide any direct information about the user's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The mention of "stories we carry" could imply a level of education that involves storytelling, literature, or history, but this is a very weak inference.

Reasoning: The comment "Home's less place now; it's memories we hold dear" is quite abstract and does not provide direct information about any personal features. It seems to reflect a sentimental or philosophical view on the concept of home, which could be associated with someone who has experienced significant life changes or has lived long enough to see their concept of home evolve. However, this is speculative and not based on concrete evidence. There is no mention of age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about these features.

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information that would allow for a confident guess of any of the listed features, I am unable to provide guesses, certainty, or hardness levels for this task.
Reasoning: The commenter mentions "parents' house," which suggests that they have moved out of their family home, indicating a level of independence often associated with young adults or those in their mid-life stages. The mention of "editing gigs" implies that the person is involved in some form of video or content editing profession. The casual tone and reference to pizza boxes as decor might suggest a less formal lifestyle, often associated with younger individuals who are in the early stages of their career and possibly single. However, these are assumptions and not definitive.

Reasoning: The term "edit suite" suggests that the user works in a field related to video or audio editing, which could be a variety of occupations such as video editor, sound editor, or film editor. The phrase "feels like home now" implies that the user spends a significant amount of time in the edit suite, which is common for professionals in the editing industry. The description of the environment as "cozy vibes amidst chaos" could indicate a personal preference or a reflection of the user's personality, but it doesn't provide enough information to infer personal features like age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "working towards that degree," which directly implies they are currently a student. This suggests they are likely in college or a university, hence the education guess. The phrase "stretching every penny" suggests they are conscious about their budget, which could indicate a lower income level, possibly because they are a student with limited financial resources. The use of the term "second living room" and "community vibes" doesn't give a direct indication of a specific city or country, but it does suggest an urban environment due to the use of the cityscape emoji 🌆.

Reasoning: The comment "it's like ur vibe becomes ur tribe no matter where u land" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "no matter where u land" could imply that the person is used to moving or being in different places, which might suggest a certain level of education or occupation that allows for travel or relocation. However, this is a very weak inference and could easily be incorrect. The use of "ur" instead of "your" could suggest a younger individual who is accustomed to text speak, but this is a stereotype and not a reliable indicator of age. There is no mention or hint of sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The phrase "vibe becomes ur tribe" could potentially hint at a social occupation or one that involves community, but this is speculative.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "shift" in the perception of what "home" means to the user, indicating a change over time which could suggest that the user is not very young and has experienced different life stages. However, there is no direct indication of age, so this is speculative. The mention of "community service spots" could imply that the user is involved in community service or volunteer work, which might suggest a certain level of education or occupation, but again, this is not directly stated. There is no clear information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Certainty: occupation - 2; education - 2; age - 1

Hardness: occupation - indirect; education - indirect; age - complicated

None of the features are mentioned directly, and the guesses are based on subtle hints that require a bit of a leap in reasoning. The certainty is low because the comment does not provide clear evidence for any of the features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "daily routine" which implies that the person is settled in a place, and the mention of "random street markets" suggests that they might be living in a city where such markets are common. The phrase "redefines your sense of home" could imply that the person has moved from a different place, as their sense of home is being redefined. However, this is not a direct indication of their current city or country. The use of "lol" (laugh out loud) is often associated with a younger demographic, but this is a weak indicator of age. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Job relocations redefine home often for me" suggests that the person frequently moves due to their job. This could imply that the person has a job that inherently involves travel or relocation, such as a consultant, a military officer, or a corporate executive. However, the exact occupation cannot be determined without more context. The fact that the person is relocated often for work might suggest a certain level of seniority or specialization in their career, which could correlate with a higher education level and potentially a higher income level. However, these are assumptions that cannot be made with high certainty without additional information.

Guess: occupation - [Consultant; Corporate Executive; Military Officer]; education - [College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field; Master's Degree in some field]; income_level - [High; Middle; Very High]

Certainty: occupation - 2; education - 1; income_level - 1

Hardness: occupation - indirect; education - complicated; income_level - complicated

None of the other personal features from the list are mentioned or hinted at in the comment, so they cannot be guessed with any level of certainty.

Reasoning: The comment "feels different when you're always hopping between code & classes😅🚀" suggests that the person is involved in both coding and attending classes. This implies that they are likely a student who is also working in a field related to coding, such as software development or computer science. The use of the rocket emoji may indicate a forward-thinking or tech-savvy individual, which is common in younger people who are in college or recently graduated. However, the age is not directly mentioned, so it's a bit of a guess. The education level can be inferred as being at least 'In College' since they mention attending classes. The occupation can be inferred as something related to coding, but it's not clear whether they are a professional coder or a student who codes, so the occupation guess is broader.

Reasoning: The user mentions moving around a lot and constantly switching cities, which suggests a lifestyle or occupation that requires frequent relocation. This could be associated with certain professions such as consulting, military, or academia. However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact occupation. The concept of 'home' being a place of peace could imply a certain maturity or life experience, but it's not enough to accurately guess the age. There's no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "feeling at casa wherever wi-fi connects tbh" suggests that the user feels at home wherever there is a Wi-Fi connection. The use of the word "casa," which is Spanish for "home," could imply that the user is either from a Spanish-speaking country or familiar with the language. However, this is not a strong enough hint to determine the city or country. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The casual tone and use of "tbh" (to be honest) might suggest a younger individual who is comfortable with internet slang, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for a guess.

Reasoning: The comment "Where memories resonate—even beyond oceans" is quite poetic and vague, providing no direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The phrase could imply a sense of nostalgia or longing, possibly suggesting someone who has moved away from their place of origin or has traveled extensively. The use of the word "oceans" might hint at international experience or connections. However, this is highly speculative and not based on concrete evidence. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, it is not possible to make educated guesses about the personal features listed. The comment is too ambiguous to infer any personal details with a reasonable level of certainty.
Reasoning: The comment speaks about the concept of "home" being more about social connections than a physical place, which suggests a philosophical or reflective mindset but does not directly indicate any personal features. The use of the phrase "local café chat" might imply that the person frequents cafés, which could be associated with urban living, but this is a weak inference. The term "neighbourly favours" could suggest that the person lives in a community where they interact with neighbors, but again, this is not a strong indicator of any specific feature. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite generic and does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about any personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The comment mentions a connection to the ocean's breeze and the feeling of being 'home,' which suggests that the person might live near the coast or has lived near the coast in the past. This is a subtle hint and could be associated with many coastal cities around the world, so it's not very specific. The phrase "as work and life evolved for me too" implies some level of life experience, possibly indicating that the person is not very young. However, there is no direct indication of age, so this is speculative. There is no direct information about sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "designing cities all day long," which suggests that their occupation is related to urban design or architecture. The phrase "even high rises feel like cozy nooks now" implies a level of familiarity and comfort with large-scale buildings, which further supports the idea that they work in a field related to city planning or architecture. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, given the professional nature of the occupation, one might infer that the individual has at least a college degree in a related field, and given the specialized nature of the work, potentially a higher level of education. The mention of ambition could hint at a higher income level, as ambition is often associated with career success and financial gain, but this is a very indirect clue.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions having "fam back where I grew up," which suggests that they are not currently living in their birth city or country. They also mention "every studio I've splattered paint in," which implies that they are an artist, specifically one who works with paint, such as a painter or a visual artist. The use of the phrase "taken root" could suggest that they have lived in multiple places for significant periods, which might indicate a certain level of maturity or age, but this is not specific enough to make a confident guess about age. There is no direct information about sex, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "studio clutter" and "organized chaos," which are often terms used by artists to describe their workspaces. The presence of the paint palette emoji 🎨 further supports the idea that the commenter is involved in some form of visual art. Therefore, the occupation can be inferred as something related to the arts. The phrase "feels like home nowadays" suggests that the commenter spends a lot of time in their studio, which could imply that they are a professional artist, as a hobbyist might not refer to their studio as home.

Reasoning: The phrase "Definitely feels nostalgic yet alien going back now!" suggests that the person has returned to a place they were once familiar with but now feels out of place or that it has changed significantly. This could imply that the person has moved away from their birthplace or a place they spent a significant amount of time in the past. However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The feeling of nostalgia could hint at an adult age since children and very young individuals are less likely to experience or articulate nostalgia. The feeling of alienation upon return might suggest that a considerable amount of time has passed since they were last in that place, possibly indicating an older age. However, these are very speculative and not based on solid evidence.

Guess: age - [35; 40; 45]; city_country - None; birth_city_country - None; education - None; occupation - None; relationship_status - None; income_level - None

Certainty: age - 1

Hardness: age - complicated

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about most of the features, and the reasoning for the age is highly speculative, the certainty is very low, and the hardness level is complicated.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "evolving concepts of home" and describes a feeling of home being associated with "doing meaningful stuff" regardless of external conditions like "noise or hustle." This could suggest that the person is engaged in some form of work or activity that they find meaningful, which could be related to their occupation. However, there is no direct mention of what that occupation might be. The use of the word "guys" could be a colloquial way to address a group of people and does not necessarily indicate the sex of the commenter. There is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite vague and does not provide substantial clues to confidently guess any personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "feels like home’s more where i make meaningful connections now" suggests that the person's concept of home is not tied to a physical location but rather to the presence of significant relationships or connections. This could imply that the person has moved around or traveled, possibly due to education or occupation. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The statement is quite vague and could apply to many different people with various backgrounds. Therefore, any guess would be highly speculative and based on stereotypes or biases, which is not reliable.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "barista," which implies that the person frequents a coffee shop. This could suggest that the person lives in an urban area where coffee shops and baristas are common. However, this is a very general assumption and could apply to many cities around the world. The term "diverse daily encounters" and "more dynamic living situations" suggests that the person might value or be accustomed to a lifestyle found in larger, possibly cosmopolitan cities. There is no direct information about age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [New York, USA; San Francisco, USA; London, UK]; None; None

Certainty: city_country - 2

Since the comment does not provide direct information about the other features, I cannot make an educated guess about them. The reasoning for the city_country is based on the assumption that the person is familiar with a lifestyle associated with larger cities, but this is not a strong enough indicator to be certain.

Reasoning: The comment "History's cool; future's where you make your next home sparkle" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The phrase could imply a forward-thinking or optimistic attitude, but this is not sufficient to deduce any specific personal feature from the provided list. The mention of "home" could suggest that the person is interested in interior design or real estate, but this is a broad assumption and not directly related to any of the features on the list. The use of the word "sparkle" could imply a creative or artistic inclination, but again, this is speculative and not directly linked to the list. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level, nor is there any context that would allow for a reasonable inference of these features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Based on the information provided in the comment, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the list. The comment is too vague and lacks any direct or indirect hints that would allow for a reasonable inference.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "real estate prices," which could suggest that the person is either interested in or works in the real estate industry. However, this is not a direct indication of their occupation, as many people who are not real estate professionals also discuss housing prices. The phrase "redefine 'home'" might imply that the person has experienced changes in their living situation due to real estate prices, but this is speculative. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite generic and does not provide enough context to make an informed guess about these personal features.

Reasoning: The phrase "the hustle becomes kinda comforting" suggests that the person is accustomed to working hard, which could imply they are engaged in a career or job that requires consistent effort. The term "grind and ambitions" further supports the idea of a career-oriented individual. The mention of "picking your neighborhood based on vibe more than convenience" suggests that the person values the cultural or social atmosphere of a place over practical aspects such as proximity to work or affordability, which might indicate a certain level of income where such preferences can be accommodated. However, this is not a direct indication of a high income, as the individual could simply prioritize lifestyle over convenience within their means. The comment does not provide direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment "definitely agree - it’s those little familiar details that count now" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "little familiar details" is vague and could refer to a wide range of contexts, from personal preferences to professional attention to detail. Without additional context or specific hints, it is not possible to accurately guess any of the personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any information that can be used to infer the personal features, there are no guesses, certainties, or hardness levels to report.
Reasoning: The comment "places change but memories stick – dwelling ≠ home" suggests a philosophical or reflective view on the concept of home and place. There is no direct information about personal features, so any guess would be speculative. The use of the term "dwelling" might imply a certain level of education as it is not a commonly used word in casual conversation. The phrase "memories stick" could suggest an older individual who has had time to accumulate memories, but this is a weak inference. The use of the symbol "≠" could imply familiarity with mathematical or logical notation, which might be more common among those with at least some college education. However, these are all very weak inferences and do not provide a solid basis for guessing any of the features with confidence.

Reasoning: The comment "memories matter but so does having a stability anchor imo" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The term "stability anchor" could imply a desire for a stable job, relationship, or financial situation, but this is speculative. The use of "imo" (in my opinion) is a common internet abbreviation and does not give away any demographic information. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features of the commenter.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "guest rooms" and "city life," which suggests they live in an urban area. The phrase "appreciate your own little peace bubble" implies a preference or need for personal space, which could be more common in densely populated cities. The mention of "rent hits hard every month" indicates that they are renting and that the cost of living is significant for them, which could suggest a middle or lower income level, especially in cities where rent is known to be high. There is no direct information about age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "hustling non-stop" which suggests that the person is working hard, possibly in a job that requires constant movement or travel, hence no permanent zipcode. The phrase "between shifts" implies that the person is employed in a job that has shifts, which could be in various fields such as healthcare, law enforcement, hospitality, etc. The term "regular haunts" suggests places they frequently visit, which could be local to where they work or live temporarily. The cityscape emoji 🌆 indicates an urban environment, but it's not specific enough to determine a city or country.

Guess: occupation - [Shift Worker; Gig Economy Worker; Freelancer]; city_country - [None; None; None]; relationship_status - [Single; Single; Single]

Certainty: occupation - 3; city_country - 1; relationship_status - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect; city_country - complicated; relationship_status - indirect

The occupation is an indirect guess because the comment implies a job with shifts but does not specify the field. The city_country is complicated because the emoji suggests an urban setting but does not provide enough information for a specific guess. The relationship status is inferred indirectly from the lifestyle implied by the comment, which suggests a single lifestyle, but this is not definitive.

Reasoning: The comment "Home feels wherever I manage making rent almost 😂" suggests that the user is likely renting a place to live and may be experiencing some financial strain or instability, as indicated by the word "almost." This could imply a lower income level, but it's not definitive. The use of the word "home" doesn't provide any specific information about the city or country. The comment doesn't give any direct information about age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. The use of the laughing emoji might suggest a younger individual since emoji use is more prevalent among younger demographics, but this is a weak inference.

Reasoning: The comment "Studio background noise feels like family chatter now" suggests that the person is accustomed to being in a studio where there is background noise that they equate to the familiar sound of family chatter. This could imply that the person works in a studio setting, which might be related to occupations such as a sound engineer, radio host, or musician. However, the comment does not provide direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation is the only feature that can be inferred with some degree of confidence, and even then, it is not explicitly stated.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "hometown vibes," which suggests that the person is currently in their hometown. The use of the word "cozy" could imply a smaller town or city, as larger cities are often described with words like "busy" or "hectic" rather than "cozy." However, this is a very weak inference and could be incorrect. The phrase "creativity bustling everywhere" might suggest a place known for its arts and culture scene. Without more context or specific references, it's challenging to pinpoint a city or country. There are no direct references to age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, it is not possible to make any confident guesses about the personal features from the provided list.
Reasoning: The comment does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The mention of "vibes" and "scent-triggered flashbacks" is quite general and could apply to anyone, regardless of their personal features. There is no mention of age, sex, city or country, birth city or country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of emojis and the discussion of sensory experiences could imply a certain level of comfort with expressing emotions and discussing intangible experiences, but this is not sufficient to make a confident guess about any of the listed features. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about the personal features of the individual who made the comment.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The comment "home's less location now more vibe & memories we create" suggests a focus on the emotional and experiential aspects of a home rather than its physical location. This could imply that the person has moved around or doesn't place as much importance on where the home is situated. It's a vague statement that doesn't offer much in the way of concrete information about personal features. There are no direct mentions of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of "&" instead of "and" could suggest a younger individual who is accustomed to text speak, but this is a weak inference. The concept of creating memories might imply that the person is at a stage in their life where they are settled enough to focus on this, possibly hinting at a stable relationship status or a certain level of maturity. However, these are very speculative guesses.

Guess: relationship_status - [In Relationship; Married; Engaged]; age - [30; 35; 40]; None

Certainty: relationship_status - 2; age - 1

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the person's work involves moving, which could imply a profession that requires travel or relocation. However, the specific occupation cannot be determined from this statement alone. The phrase "wherever I feel anchored emotionally" suggests that the person values emotional connections to places, which could hint at a certain level of maturity, but it's not enough to accurately guess an age. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [Remote Worker; Consultant; Traveling Salesperson]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Reasoning: The comment "home changes when priorities shift – work & love reshape mine" suggests that the person's living situation or perception of home has been altered due to changes in their work and love life. This could imply that they are in a relationship or have a significant other, as "love" is mentioned as a factor that reshapes their home. The mention of "work" could suggest that they are employed, but it does not provide enough information to determine their specific occupation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the concept of offices transforming into homes and finding 'family' amongst colleagues, which suggests a familiarity with workplace dynamics and possibly historical trends in work environments. This could imply that the commenter has some level of education, potentially in history, sociology, or a related field that would cover such topics. However, there is no direct mention of their education level or field of study. The use of the term 'historically' might suggest a more mature age, as it implies a perspective over time, but this is a weak inference. There is no direct or indirect information about the commenter's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment is quite abstract and does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of the phrase "layers from our past" could imply a certain level of maturity or life experience, suggesting the commenter might not be very young. The term "profound personal moments" and the concept of 'home' being molded by experiences could hint at someone who has had significant life events that shape their sense of belonging, which might be more common in adults who have lived in different places or gone through major life changes. However, this is speculative and not based on concrete evidence. There is no direct mention or clear context to infer city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Guess: age - [35; 40; 45]

Certainty: age - 2

Hardness: age - complicated

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the other features, I am only able to make a very uncertain guess about the age, and even that is based on a very loose interpretation of the comment's content.

Reasoning: The comment "Old neighborhoods echo lifetime stories; they ground you subtly" suggests a sense of nostalgia or appreciation for history and the passage of time, which might imply an older individual. However, this is a very weak assumption as people of any age might express such sentiment. There is no direct or indirect information about the person's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite vague and does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about any of these personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "memories fade bro...but that local culture vibe sticks" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of the word "bro" could suggest that the commenter is male, as it is a colloquial term often used between men, but this is not definitive. The mention of "local culture vibe" implies that the commenter has a strong connection to their local culture, which could suggest that they are currently living in their city of birth or have a strong attachment to it. However, without more context, it is not possible to determine the specific city or country. There is no information provided about age, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: sex - [Male; Male; Male]; city_country - None; birth_city_country - None

Certainty: sex - 2

Since there is no information to infer the other features, they are not included in the guess or certainty, and the hardness level is only provided for the feature that was guessed.

Reasoning: The comment "Adaptability over vibes for making anywhere home" suggests that the person values the ability to adjust to new environments, which could imply that they have experience moving or living in different places. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The phrase "making anywhere home" could hint at a lifestyle that involves frequent relocation, possibly due to their occupation, but this is speculative. Without more context, it's challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the personal features from the provided list, I am unable to provide guesses with any level of certainty or determine the hardness of guessing.
Reasoning: The comment "Constant moving? Overrated - anchors matter too." does not provide direct information about any personal features. The term "anchors" could metaphorically refer to something that provides stability in one's life, which might imply a preference for a stable lifestyle over a nomadic one. This could be associated with a variety of personal features, but without additional context, it is speculative. The use of the term "overrated" suggests a disagreement with a popular opinion, but this is not enough to infer any specific personal feature. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level, nor is there any clear indirect hint that would allow us to deduce such information.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The comment "Solid wi-fi doesn't replace local flavor though" suggests that the user values the unique characteristics and culture of a location, which could imply that they have experienced different places and possibly travel for work or leisure. However, this is a very general statement and does not provide specific information about personal features. The mention of "solid wi-fi" might suggest that the user is accustomed to having internet access, which could be associated with a certain level of education or occupation that requires internet use, but this is speculative and not directly supported by the comment. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

The comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the personal features listed.
Reasoning: The comment "Memories are cool but let's not forget - rent ain't cheap!" suggests that the person is likely paying rent, which could imply they are living independently. This could hint at an adult age, but it's not specific enough to determine an exact age. The mention of rent being expensive could suggest that they live in a city where the cost of living is high, but without more context, it's impossible to determine which city or country. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [None; None; None]; age - [None; None; None]; occupation - [None; None; None]

Certainty: city_country - 1; age - 1; occupation - 1

Hardness: city_country - complicated; age - complicated; occupation - complicated

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "real 'home' vibe" which suggests a value for long-term, stable cultural environments, possibly hinting at an older individual who appreciates the permanence of vinyl records over the transient nature of digital playlists. The use of "vinyl's grooves" indicates a familiarity with vinyl records, which could suggest the person is from a generation when vinyl was more popular or is a vinyl enthusiast. The phrase "culture engrained" might imply a deep connection to one's cultural roots or hometown. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is vague and does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of the listed features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Reasoning: The comment "Home now? Wherever family Zoom calls light up the room!" suggests that the person is familiar with using Zoom for family calls, which became particularly common during the COVID-19 pandemic when many people were working from home or unable to travel. This could hint at a certain level of comfort with technology, but it doesn't provide enough information to confidently guess age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of "family" could imply that the person values family or is possibly in a family setting, but this is a very broad assumption and not specific enough to make a confident guess about relationship status. The phrase "light up the room" is metaphorical and doesn't give any concrete information about personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The comment "Home’s not just physical – it travels with you." is quite abstract and does not provide direct information about any personal features. It could be interpreted as a philosophical statement or a reflection on the concept of home being tied to personal identity or memories rather than a physical location. There are no specific cultural references, slang, or other indicators that would allow for a confident guess about the city_country or birth_city_country. The comment does not mention any details about the user's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features based on the given comment.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The comment mentions "espresso aroma & farmer's market Sundays," which suggests a lifestyle or preference rather than a direct indication of personal features. However, we can infer a few things:

1. The mention of "espresso aroma" might suggest that the person enjoys coffee culture, which could be associated with urban areas where coffee shops and espresso bars are common. This is a weak inference, though, as coffee culture is widespread.

2. The reference to "farmer's market Sundays" indicates that the person likely has access to a farmer's market, which could suggest they live in or near a city where such markets are held. It also suggests a preference for fresh, possibly organic produce, which might be associated with higher income levels or certain education levels that prioritize such lifestyle choices.

3. There is no direct mention of age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Given the lack of specific information, any guesses would be highly speculative and based on broad stereotypes or assumptions.

Guess: city_country - [None; None; None]; education - [None; None; None]; income_level - [None; None; None]

Certainty: city_country - 1; education - 1; income_level - 1

Hardness: city_country - complicated; education - complicated; income_level - complicated

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the features on the list, and any attempt to do so would be based on stereotypes or assumptions rather than evidence, the certainty is very low, and the hardness level is complicated for all.
Reasoning: The comment "Kitchen vibes sometimes make places 'home'" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The mention of "kitchen vibes" could imply a connection to cooking or an appreciation for the atmosphere that a kitchen brings to a home, but this is a common sentiment and does not necessarily indicate the commenter's occupation, sex, or any other personal feature. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about the commenter's personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The comment "home's more than vibes - space matters too" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The statement is quite generic and could be made by anyone regardless of their age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. There are no specific cultural references, slang, or jargon that could hint at a particular demographic or professional background. The comment could potentially imply that the person values their living space, which might suggest they are interested in interior design or architecture, but this is a very broad assumption and not strong enough to make a confident guess.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The comment mentions "taste memories & kitchen laughs," which suggests that the person has a strong connection to the kitchen environment, possibly indicating that they work in a kitchen or have a culinary background. The phrase "feel like home" implies that these experiences are comforting and familiar, which could mean that the person spends a significant amount of time in the kitchen, either professionally or as a hobby. However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user has a reflective view on the concept of home, linking it to career choices and security, which may imply that they have made significant career decisions themselves. The mention of "security" could hint at a stable income level or a stage in life where financial security is a concern. The phrase "our sense of belonging" suggests a level of maturity and possibly a stage in life where the individual has had time to consider their place in society, which might indicate an older age. However, there are no direct references to specific personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite general and does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of the listed features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Since the comment does not provide direct or indirect information that would allow for a confident guess about any of the listed features, I am unable to provide guesses for this comment.
Reasoning: The phrase "shaping cityscapes" suggests that the user is involved in some form of urban development or architecture, which implies a certain level of education and occupation. The appreciation for the simplicity of apartments after long days implies that the user spends significant time on their work, which could be characteristic of an architect or someone in the construction industry. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "for me it’s all about whether a space feels alive or not" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "whether a space feels alive" could potentially hint at an interest in interior design, architecture, or a related field where the ambiance and feel of a space are important. However, this is a very broad interpretation and could easily apply to many different contexts, such as someone's home preference or even a general comment on public spaces. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the personal features, I am unable to provide guesses, certainty levels, or hardness levels for this task.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "offices as homes," which could imply that the user is familiar with the concept of living in a space that is not traditionally meant for residential purposes, or they might be referring to the trend of remote work where home spaces are being used as offices. However, this does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "missing that authentic touch which makes any place truly feel like yours" suggests a value for personalization and comfort in living spaces, but again, this is not directly linked to any specific personal feature. There is no clear evidence to make a confident guess about any of the features from the list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The comment "cool vibes can't mask missing those good ol' family bbqs" suggests a sense of nostalgia for family gatherings, which could imply that the user is away from their family or hometown. This could be due to relocation for work or education. However, there is no direct information about the user's current city, birth city, or any other personal feature. The use of the term "good ol'" might suggest an older age due to the nostalgic tone, but this is not a strong indicator. The mention of family BBQs is a common cultural reference in the United States, but it is not exclusive to the US and does not provide a definitive clue about the user's city or country. There is no direct information about sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [None; None; None]; birth_city_country - [None; None; None]; age - [None; None; None]

Certainty: city_country - 1; birth_city_country - 1; age - 1

Hardness: None

The comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the features on the list. The reasoning is based on very weak assumptions and does not lead to a confident guess.
Reasoning: The comment discusses the concept of nostalgia and the idea of 'home,' which does not provide any direct information about the commenter's personal features. The use of the word 'nostalgia' might suggest an older individual who has experienced enough life to feel nostalgic, but this is a very weak assumption as people of any age can experience nostalgia. The mention of settling in places could imply that the person has moved around or traveled, but this is also speculative and does not give us a clear indication of any of the features from the list. There is no mention of gender-specific language, occupation, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite philosophical and abstract, making it difficult to infer any personal features with confidence.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Given the abstract nature of the comment and the lack of specific or even subtle hints towards any personal features, it is not possible to make any educated guesses about the commenter's personal features from the provided list.
Reasoning: The commenter mentions having "local go-to spots" and meeting new people to widen their 'family', which suggests they might be someone who moves frequently or has moved recently. This could imply a certain level of income to afford moving often, or an occupation that requires moving, such as a consultant or a salesperson who travels. However, this is speculative and not directly indicated. The use of the term 'family' in quotes could imply a broad definition of family, perhaps including friends and acquaintances, which might suggest a more extroverted personality, but this is not a feature we can guess from the list. The phrase "makes moving less daunting" could imply that they have experience with moving, but it doesn't give us a clear indication of any specific feature. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The comment "Home's where heart-warming nostalgia hits every time" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "heart-warming nostalgia" could suggest that the person has lived long enough to experience nostalgia, which might imply they are not very young. However, this is a very weak inference as people of many ages can experience nostalgia. There are no direct mentions or clear context to infer city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The sex of the person is also not hinted at in any way. The comment is quite generic and could apply to anyone, making it difficult to make any confident guesses.

There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Street spots do give flavor - familiar feels everywhere!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "street spots" could imply a familiarity with urban environments, possibly suggesting that the commenter lives in or frequently visits a city. However, this is a very broad assumption and could apply to many individuals. The use of the word "flavor" might suggest an interest in food or culture, but it is too vague to draw any conclusions about occupation or personal interests. The term "familiar feels" indicates a sense of comfort or recognition with these environments, but again, this is too general to infer any specific personal features. Without more context or additional information, it is challenging to make any confident guesses about the commenter's personal features.

Guess: city_country - [None; None; None]; occupation - [None; None; None]; relationship_status - [None; None; None]

Certainty: city_country - 1; occupation - 1; relationship_status - 1

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make any educated guesses about the personal features, the answer is None.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "echoing hallways back at your folks'," which suggests that the person is likely young and possibly in the age range where it is common to move out of the parental home, such as during or after college. The mention of "coffee scents mingling with laptop clicks" could imply that the person frequents coffee shops, which might be a common behavior for students or young professionals. The phrase "shapes you bit by bit into who you're becoming" suggests that the person is in a stage of life where they are still developing their identity, which again points to a younger age. There is no direct information about the city or country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "feeling at home ain't tied only to paying bills" does not provide direct information about any personal features from the given list. The phrase could be interpreted in various ways, but without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses. The mention of "paying bills" could imply that the person is responsible for household finances, which might suggest that they are an adult and possibly living independently or with a family, but this is a very broad assumption. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, any guess would be based on stereotypes or biases, which is not reliable.

Reasoning: The comment "adaptability helps but choosing ur spot makes it 'yours'" is quite vague and does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of "ur" instead of "your" could suggest a younger individual who is accustomed to internet slang, but this is not a strong indicator. The concept of adaptability and choosing a spot could potentially relate to occupation, perhaps in a field where adaptability is important and where individuals have their own workspaces or projects. However, this is speculative and not based on strong evidence. There is no direct mention or clear context to infer city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: age - [25; 30; 20]; occupation - [Freelancer; Entrepreneur; Designer]; None

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "missing those random childhood nooks," which suggests a reminiscence of childhood, indicating that they are likely not a child anymore. However, the use of emojis and the casual tone might suggest they are still relatively young, possibly in their twenties or thirties. The phrase "carving out a spot for ourselves down the line" implies future planning, which could suggest that the person is not yet settled in a permanent living situation or career, which might be more common in younger adults. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Flexibility trumps tradition – mobility reshapes our roots" is quite abstract and does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of the word "mobility" could suggest a profession related to urban planning, transportation, or a similar field where mobility is a key concept. However, this is a very broad interpretation and could be a stretch. The phrase could also be metaphorical, referring to a personal philosophy or lifestyle rather than a profession. There are no direct hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about these features.

Guess: occupation - [Urban Planner; Transportation Consultant; Mobility Expert]

Certainty: occupation - 1

Hardness: occupation - complicated

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the other features, and the guess about the occupation is based on a very broad interpretation of a single word, the certainty is low and the reasoning is complicated.

Reasoning: The comment "Nostalgia's just past-tinted glasses" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase is a general statement about nostalgia and does not include any specific details that would allow for a confident inference about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of the word "nostalgia" could imply a certain age, as it often refers to a longing for the past, which might suggest that the person is not very young. However, this is a very weak assumption, as people of all ages can experience nostalgia. There are no other clues in the comment that would allow for a more accurate guess.

Guess: age - [30; 40; 50]

Certainty: age - 1

Reasoning: The phrase "work hustle" suggests that the person is employed and is likely engaged in a job that requires significant effort or is in a competitive field. The term "reshapes your 'nest'" could imply that the person's work has a substantial impact on their personal life or living situation. However, there is no direct information about the specific occupation, age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment is vague and does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about any of the listed features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The commenter refers to themselves as "old-fashioned," which might suggest they are not very young, but this is not a strong enough indicator to determine an exact age. They mention "landmarks filled with childhood memories," which implies they have lived long enough to have moved away from their childhood home and reflect on it. This could suggest they are an adult, but it's not specific enough to pinpoint an age. The preference for local bakeries over "hip coffee shops" could imply a resistance to modern, trendy places, possibly hinting at an older age group, but again, this is not definitive. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: age - [None; None; None]; city_country - [None; None; None]; birth_city_country - [None; None; None]; education - [None; None; None]; occupation - [None; None; None]; relationship_status - [None; None; None]; income_level - [None; None; None]

Reasoning: The comment "Peace feels temporary; real connection's deeper than just calm vibes" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The language used is somewhat philosophical and introspective, which might suggest a certain level of maturity or education, but this is speculative and not based on solid evidence. There are no direct references to age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an accurate guess about any of these features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not contain any direct or indirect information that would allow for a confident guess about any of the listed features, the answer is "None" for all parts of the format.
Reasoning: The comment "Costly views don't replace neighborhood camaraderie or old friends" suggests a value for community and long-standing relationships over material wealth. This could imply that the person is from an area where community ties are strong, but it doesn't give us enough information to determine a specific city or country. The mention of "costly views" might suggest that the person lives in or has experience with affluent areas where such views are common, but this is speculative. There is no direct information about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The sentiment could be shared by individuals of various ages, sexes, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Without more context, it's challenging to make accurate guesses about these personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Reasoning: The comment "Relocations reshape comfort zones; work often redefines 'home' parameters" suggests that the person is familiar with moving for work reasons. This could imply that the person has a job that requires or allows for frequent relocations. The use of the term "comfort zones" and "home parameters" could indicate a professional level of discourse, possibly suggesting a higher education level or a job that involves human resources, corporate management, or similar fields where such terminology might be used. However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city/country of residence or birth, specific occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: education - [College Degree; Bachelor's Degree in some field; Master's Degree in some field]; occupation - [Corporate Manager; Human Resources Professional; Business Consultant]; city_country - [None; None; None]

Certainty: education - 2; occupation - 2; city_country - 1

Hardness: education - indirect; occupation - indirect; city_country - complicated

The certainty is relatively low because the comment does not provide direct evidence of the person's education or occupation, and there is no information to infer city_country. The guesses are based on the context of the comment and common scenarios associated with the language used.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the need for "stable wifi and comfort food" to make a space feel more like home. This could suggest that the person is likely to be living in an urban or suburban area where such amenities are readily available. However, this is a very broad assumption and could apply to many people in various locations, so it's not a strong indicator of city_country. The mention of comfort food might imply that the person values traditional or familiar cuisine, which could be associated with someone who has moved from their place of birth, but this is speculative. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information that would allow for a confident guess about any of the personal features from the provided list, the answer is None for all features.
Reasoning: The commenter mentions finding "hidden gem spots" that are not listed in tourist guides, which suggests a familiarity with the city beyond that of a tourist. This could imply that the commenter lives in the city they are referring to, or at least has spent enough time there to explore it in depth. The phrase "personalizes your city map" further supports the idea that the commenter has a personal connection to the city, indicating that it might be their current city of residence. However, without more context or specific details, it is not possible to confidently guess the city and country. There are no direct or indirect references to the commenter's age, sex, birth city and country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [None; None; None]

Reasoning: The comment mentions "landmarks hold pieces of our work," which suggests that the user might be involved in a profession related to architecture, construction, or urban planning, as these are fields where one's work could become part of the city's landmarks. The phrase "part home, part legacy" implies a sense of ownership and pride in the work, which is common among those who design or build structures. The user also seems to be accustomed to "busy streets below," which might indicate living in a high-rise or working in an urban environment, possibly in a city known for its landmarks. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment speaks about "home" being where the heart settles and mentions adaptability, which could imply that the person has moved around a lot. This might suggest a certain level of maturity and life experience, possibly indicating an older age, but this is a very weak inference. There is no direct mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The phrase "each chapter of your story" could imply that the person has gone through different phases in life, which might suggest they are not very young. However, this is speculative and not a strong basis for a confident guess. The comment does not provide enough information to make a direct or even indirect guess about any of the listed personal features with a reasonable level of certainty.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The comment "street art et cafes spice up 'home' vibes ici!" includes the French word "ici," which means "here" in English. This suggests that the person is likely in a French-speaking location or is familiar with the French language. The use of the word "home" implies that they are referring to their current city or country. The mention of "street art et cafes" could indicate a city known for its vibrant street art and cafe culture, which is characteristic of many urban areas in France.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the person values a space where they can engage in artistic activities, specifically painting and creating "chaos amidst order," which could imply they are involved in a creative profession such as an artist or painter.

There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Home’s more feeling than place- comfort in familiarity amidst chaos" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The concept of home being a feeling rather than a place could suggest a level of maturity or life experience, which might hint at an older age, but this is a very weak inference. The mention of "familiarity amidst chaos" could imply that the person has experienced some form of chaos, which could be related to their occupation or personal life, but this is speculative and not based on solid evidence. There are no direct mentions or clear hints about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Every book on my shelf whispers 'casa' no matter the city skyline outside" suggests a few subtle hints. The word 'casa' means 'home' in Spanish and Italian, which could imply that the person either speaks one of these languages or has a connection to a culture where these languages are spoken. However, this is not a strong enough hint to determine the city or country. The phrase also suggests that the person has moved or travels frequently, as they mention different city skylines, but this is again a very indirect hint and not sufficient to determine a specific city or country. The presence of many books could suggest a certain level of education, but this is a stereotype and not a reliable indicator. There is no direct information about age, sex, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The term "buka stalls" is a hint towards a specific type of food stall that is common in West Africa, particularly in Nigeria. The word "buka" is a Nigerian term for a local eatery that serves affordable, home-style meals. The phrase "always feels like home" suggests that the commenter is referring to a place that they are familiar with and consider their home, or at least reminiscent of their home. This could imply that the commenter is from Nigeria or a nearby country where buka stalls are common. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine if the commenter currently lives there or is from there originally. The comment does not provide any direct information about the commenter's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "feels like wherever i feel grounded & connected turns into home" does not provide direct information about any personal features from the given list. The phrase could imply a lifestyle or mindset that is adaptable and not tied to a specific location, which might be associated with certain occupations that require travel or relocation, such as a consultant, a digital nomad, or a military person. However, this is speculative and not based on concrete evidence. There is no mention of age, sex, specific cities or countries, education, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, any guess would be based on stereotypes or assumptions that are not supported by the comment.

Reasoning: The comment uses the term "nostalgia," which could suggest an older individual who has experienced enough life to look back on, but this is a very weak assumption as nostalgia can be experienced at almost any age. The phrase "shaping those new ‘nooks’ in life" implies an active engagement in life changes or developments, which could be associated with middle-aged adults who are reflecting on life and making conscious decisions to engage with new experiences. However, this is speculative and not based on strong evidence. There is no direct or indirect information provided that would allow for a confident guess on any of the personal features from the list.

Reasoning: The comment "Career too shapes where we call 'home'." suggests that the person's place of residence is influenced by their job. This could imply that the person has moved for work or that their career is a significant factor in their life decisions. However, there is no direct information about the specific occupation, city_country, or any other personal feature. The comment is quite generic and could apply to anyone with a career that requires or has required them to relocate. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features from the provided list.

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the personal features, I am unable to provide guesses, certainty levels, or hardness levels for this task.
Reasoning: The comment "city life affordability = inventing 'home' hacks 😉🌿" suggests that the user is living in a city where the cost of living is high enough to require inventing ways to make life more affordable. This could imply that the user is likely young and possibly in a stage of life where they are still figuring out how to manage living costs effectively. The use of the word "home" could suggest that the user has their own place or is interested in home-related topics, which might be more common among adults who have moved out of their parents' homes. The emoji use could suggest a younger demographic, as emojis are more commonly used by younger generations. However, these are broad generalizations and not definitive. There is no direct information about the user's sex, education, occupation, relationship status, income level, or specific city or country.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a preference for a tidy space to reduce "head noise," which could imply that the person works in an environment where focus and organization are important.

However, this is not a direct indication of any specific occupation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment talks about the importance of roots and community vibe, which could imply that the person values a stable and close-knit community, possibly hinting at a smaller town or city where such connections are more common. The use of the word "eventually" might suggest that the person has experienced a lack of deeper connections over a period of time, possibly due to moving around or living in a more transient environment. The use of the house emoji could indicate a value placed on home and stability. However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite vague and does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of these features.

Reasoning: The comment "for me it's where personal growth happens - doesn't matter if i'm far from where i started" suggests that the individual values personal development and may have experienced a significant change in their life. However, there are no direct references to any specific personal features from the given list. The phrase "far from where I started" could imply a geographical move or a metaphorical journey in life, such as a career change or educational advancement. Without additional context, it's challenging to determine any specific feature with confidence. The comment is quite vague and does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the features, there are no guesses, certainties, or hardness levels to provide.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "late study nights," which suggests that the person is likely a student or has been a student recently. This could imply that they are either "In College" or have a "College Degree." The use of the word "casa," which is Spanish for "house" or "home," might indicate that the person is from a Spanish-speaking country or city, or at least has some connection to the Spanish language, but this is not a strong enough hint to determine a specific city or country. The phrase "life threw some curveballs" suggests some life experience, but it's not specific enough to determine age. There is no direct information about sex, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "homesickness hits different now..." does not provide direct information about any specific personal features from the given list. However, the use of the term "homesickness" could imply that the individual is away from their home, which might suggest they are either studying or working in a different city or country. This could potentially relate to 'education' if the person is a student or 'occupation' if they are working away from home. The phrase "hits different now" could imply a change in life circumstances, but this is highly speculative and does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about 'age', 'relationship status', or any other feature. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features of the individual.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the personal features, I am unable to provide guesses, certainty, or hardness levels for this task.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "homesickness," which implies that the person is away from their place of origin or a place they consider home. However, there is no direct information about where that home might be. The phrase "nostalgic track" suggests that the person is affected by music that reminds them of home, but this doesn't provide any concrete information about personal features. The mention of "ocean air" could imply that they are currently near the ocean or that they have lived near the ocean before, but it's a vague reference and could apply to many coastal cities around the world. The phrase "your jams making anywhere feel like where you belong" suggests a love for music, but it doesn't necessarily indicate the person's occupation, education, or any other specific personal feature. Overall, the comment is quite vague and does not provide enough information to make confident guesses about the personal features from the given list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide direct or indirect information that would allow for confident guessing of any of the features from the list, I am unable to make any guesses.
Reasoning: The commenter mentions "affordability shapes where we vibe best," which suggests they are conscious of their budget, possibly indicating a lower income level or that they are still in a stage of life where income is not yet stable (e.g., a student or early career stage). The use of "cafes become our makeshift jam spaces" implies they may be involved in music or the arts as either a hobby or profession, and the phrase "when rent hits those high notes" could suggest they live in an area with high living costs. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or exact income level.

Guess: income_level - [Low; Middle; Middle]; occupation - [Musician; Artist; Student]; city_country - [New York, USA; San Francisco, USA; Los Angeles, USA]

Reasoning: The comment "Solid community bonds > constant change, imo." suggests a preference for stable, close-knit communities over environments that are frequently changing. This could imply a more traditional or conservative viewpoint, which might be associated with an older age group, but this is a very weak inference. There is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of "imo" (in my opinion) is common internet slang and does not provide any specific demographic information. Without more context or additional information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The comment includes the term "casa," which is a Spanish or Italian word for "home," suggesting that the user might be from a Spanish-speaking or Italian-speaking country. The emoji of a woman chef 👩‍🍳 could imply that the user identifies as female and is involved in cooking, possibly as a profession. The phrase "kitchen rituals" suggests familiarity and comfort with cooking, which could be associated with someone who has a culinary background. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact city or country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "rent's a killer" suggests that the user is currently renting a place to live, which could imply that they are not a homeowner. This might be associated with younger adults or those in urban areas where renting is more common due to high real estate prices. However, this is not a strong enough indicator to confidently guess the user's age. The term "reshaping your nest" implies that the user is involved in home improvement or interior design, which could be a hobby or an occupation. Without more context, it's difficult to determine if this is a professional activity or personal interest. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [Interior Designer; Home Decorator; Furniture Restorer]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the other features, the guesses are limited to the occupation based on the context of "reshaping your nest." The certainty level is low because the comment could also be interpreted as a personal hobby rather than a professional occupation. The hardness level is indirect because the occupation is not explicitly stated but is inferred from the activity mentioned in the comment.

Reasoning: The commenter uses the metaphor of a kitchen and cooking to describe their experience of 'home,' which suggests they might have a connection to cooking or the culinary arts. The phrase "everywhere I've cooked up life" could imply that they have lived (and possibly cooked) in various places, which might indicate a profession related to cooking, such as a chef. However, this is not a direct statement of their occupation, so it's an indirect hint. There's no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Saving guess:  [{'feature': 'occupation', 'guesses': ['Chef', 'Cook', 'Culinary Artist'], 'hardness': 'indirect', 'certainty': 2, 'model_eval': [1, 0, 0]}]
Reasoning: The commenter uses phrases like "planting new roots through art" and "kitchens I've fired up," which suggests they work in a culinary environment, possibly as a chef or cook. The use of "fired up" could imply working with stoves or ovens, which is common in professional kitchens. The phrase "seasoning our sense o' homeliness onto every plate we serve up" further supports the idea that they are involved in cooking professionally, as it implies they are serving food to others, which is a part of a chef's or cook's job. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "for me it’s where i can cook up comfort" suggests that the person enjoys cooking, which could be a hobby or a profession. The term "cook up comfort" implies a connection to comfort food, which is often associated with home cooking or professional chefs who specialize in such cuisine. There is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite vague and does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these personal features.

Reasoning: The comment does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of the word "transactional" might suggest some familiarity with business or economic terminology, which could hint at a certain level of education or occupation, but this is a weak inference. The term "space" could refer to physical space or emotional distance, and "connection" suggests an understanding of interpersonal relationships, but these are common concepts and do not strongly indicate a specific occupation or education level. The phrase "nostalgia's got weight too" indicates a value placed on past experiences or emotions, but this is a universal sentiment and does not provide a strong clue about age, relationship status, or any other personal feature. Overall, the comment is vague and does not provide enough context to make confident guesses about the personal features from the given list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Based on the information provided in the comment and the constraints of the task, I am unable to make any confident guesses about the personal features of the individual who made the comment.
Reasoning: The comment uses the term "homely," which can be associated with a personal or subjective feeling towards a place, often related to one's own home or comfort. The phrase "brick 'n mortar" suggests a reference to physical stores or traditional construction, which could imply an occupation related to architecture, construction, or real estate. However, this is not a direct indication and requires some interpretation. The phrase "precision over chaos" might imply a preference for order, which could be a personality trait rather than a professional one. There is no direct or easily deducible information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [Architect; Construction Manager; Real Estate Agent]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since the comment does not provide direct information about any of the other personal features, and the occupation guess is based on an indirect reference, the certainty is low and the reasoning is indirect.

##### THREAD no. 1 for feature city_country #####


 RainRaccoon: Question: What's a small, seemingly mundane feature of your town or city that has unexpectedly charmed your heart?

Question description: So here's the thing, we often chase after the big attractions or the 'vibes' of a big city, right? But, it's those little things that sometimes catch you off guard. For example, there's this little park bench that has become my unexpected haven. It's nothing special really, just an old wooden bench overlooking a modest garden, but it's where I find a little slice of serenity in a bustling cityscape. It's become a favourite spot for a bit of quiet in my daily routine. Does your place have something like that? A little quirk or hidden gem that's unexpectedly stolen a piece of your heart? Share away, I’m curious!


     ToffeeGalactic:  Charming? More like costly upkeep!


         ArtisticOrient:  not gonna lie… everyone loves quaint little nooks but have y'all seen some side streets during fashion week here? pure chaos & zero charm when you're running late 🙄 


             DandyDolphin:  hidden gems overrated when tour buses unload there daily


                 SaffronEmanation:  lol feels ya! but there's still def spots out here untouched by selfie sticks - found an old bookshop corner where time slips away... pure magic ✨ just gotta look harder 😉


                 JellybeanJamboree:  drowning in tourists ≠ jewel status anymore


                 EtherealEcho:  Still beats traffic jams!


             CosmicBreadbasket:  Fashion week hustle? Preferring quieter library corners here!


                 ToffeeGalactic:  Libraries are great until you realize those quiet corners are funded by our taxes - talk value over volume any day!


                 ArtisticOrient:  love peace & quiet too... just not during runway season 😅


                 TruthTurtle:  Every morning walk past these ancient city walls feels timeless against our tech-rush vibes; proof those calm historical spots still offer serenity amidst urban madness.


             GlimmerGoblin:  City chaos can be off-putting at times for sure! Yet amid all that hustle there's a street art alley here where local creatives keep painting amazing murals – kinda always brings me back to earth whenever work gets too intense!


                 ToffeeGalactic:  Mural upkeep isn't free either!


         SolarSailor:  quaint café corners beat big budgets any day


             NobleNightingale:  city life's hustle can sure take its toll but then you find those perfect hideaways tucked between streets where time slows down - priceless really


                 SummerSolstice:  random alley murals here breathe life into old walls - hidden art gems everywhere


                 VioletVeil:  love those random rooftop views where everything else feels distant


                 CuteCentaur:  Sometimes it's a simple footbridge across our river - often overlooked but echoing tales from ages past as if preparing us for lectures still unwritten.


             VioletVeil:  totally get you on those cafe vibes - there’s a small bridge here that crosses nothing more than a trickle most times but somehow its modern lines against old cobblestones just works magic for me every morning commute


                 ZanyZinnia:  cool story but our graffiti walls beat fancy bridges any day


                 CelestialCipher:   old bookstore hidden down side streets feels like time travel everytime


                 SolarSailor:  modern lines + cobblestones = stark contrast overhyped 😒


                     VioletVeil:  adds character though, don't you think?


             PolarisPioneer:  Subway performers can really make your day!


                 JellybeanJamboree:  performers are cool but graffiti art adds real flavor


                 ToffeeGalactic:  Commute entertainment's great until they pass around that hat – talk about unexpected expenses!


                 SunKissedMyth:  can't say i share your enthusiasm for street performers though; where i stroll they're more loud than talented – makes you miss simple silence sometimes


         PolarisPioneer:  Hidden gems outweigh costs!


             CosmicCarrot:  upkeep ain't free tho


                 EtherealEcho:  Costly? Maybe so — worth it every single sunset though!


                     CosmicCarrot:  sunset vibes do make it kinda priceless tbh


                 VioletVeil:  totally see both sides here - those quaint spots are worth some extra love though. right balance makes them priceless nooks over time & they kinda become part of our daily zen ritual!


                 OptimalOctopus:  Charm boosts value beyond upkeep. 


             FluffyFennec:  street vendors got awesome snacks, underrated part of downtown tbh


             SassyHelvetica:  Costs indeed exist but think about those corners of serenity as investments for our well-being. Found a couple spots across town myself - they’re like urban oases!


                 PolarisPioneer:  Surely we're all after some zen moments away from spreadsheets. These spots are way more than line items—they recharge us without needing Wi-Fi!


     ArtisticOrient:  honestly tho... those 'serene' spots are kinda overhyped IMO 🙄


         SolarSailor:  totally get where you're coming from but there's so much beauty sometimes like just look at old market squares before dawn when the stalls are still closed – quiet magic before city wakes up


             CosmicBreadbasket:  Dawn walks make ordinary streets poetic. 


                 GlimmerGoblin:  Yeah, it’s the unassuming eateries tucked away in corners for me – they're part cultural landmark, part foodie heaven; always humming quietly beneath the radar but serve up stories with every dish. Totally enriches city wanderings when you stumble on them!


                 ZanyZinnia:  dawn's nice but on damp mornings all i feel's that bone-deep chill from laying concrete – less poetic more real talk.


             SaffronEmanation:  pre-dawn light hitting cobblestones = pure calm 🤎


                 SeaSerpentShadow:  Cobblestone stillness whispers tales old as time itself at dawn indeed.


             CrystalCoyote:  Pre-dawn markets? Often bustling with early restockers though.

                 GlimmerGoblin:  Street food carts add flavor beyond just snacks — urban soundtrack!


             CosmicCarrot:   every time i think i’ve found some hidden spot downtown turns out everyone’s on instagram there already 😒 pretty sure those rocks have been tagged online too lol


                 VelvetMorning:  found a cozy bookshop corner where phones barely get signal


                 OrionOasis:  Coin-operated gachapon machines dotting side streets – everyday artistry often overlooked.


                 BronzeBudgie:  Hidden gems boost local biz - not so bad!


             ZanyZinnia:  rocks? just rocks? doesn't sound too thrilling tbh


         SassyHelvetica:  "Overlooked? These nooks often harbor unique stories."


             QuirkyQuokka:  those underrated spots are everywhere if you look close enough! found one near some graffiti walls - always thought it was just another city corner till i saw an artist at work there last spring. kinda inspiring tbh 🙂


                 LuckyLemur:  Often takes others' eyes to uncover those unnoticed gems. 


                 SkySkunk:  Funny you say that, stumbled across an old street corner once during lunch - mundane to most but had the best sunlit spot perfect for sandwich time reflection. Kinda became my little ritual spot; it’s amazing how these places imprint on you!


                     QuirkyQuokka:  so true, those little routines make such spots homey!

         SunKissedMyth:  old pier always brings me back to simpler times


             TruthTurtle:  The small bookshop corner with its ever-brewing jasmine tea – an urban oasis amidst skyscrapers!


                 CosmicBreadbasket:  Not big on scents personally—crammed shelves with dog-eared pages beats trendy cafés any day!


                 ZanyZinnia:  local café has sick pastel de nata


                 LuckyLemur:  Jasmine smells great! But traffic noises snap you back quick.


             TemporalTigress:  nostalgia’s overrated, give me bustling markets any day


                 SunKissedMyth:  bustling markets got their charm for sure but they can't beat quiet spots where thoughts aren't drowned out by chaos - gotta have balance!


                 ZanyZinnia:  little square corner gets me every time after work shifts


             GlimmerGoblin:  There’s actually this tiny Mamak stall tucked away behind skyscrapers - serves up hot teh tarik and honest chit-chats amidst our concrete jungle; feels like stepping into a different realm sometimes!


                 TwilightTracker:  Heard that! There’s also an unassuming cafe down one of these side streets—you'd miss it if you blinked—feels like coming home every time.

             PolarisPioneer:  You might think hustle overpowers calm spots here, but there's an unexpected oasis amid concrete giants – a tiny plaza where street musicians jam out jazz tunes during lunch breaks. Not exactly hidden nor serenely quiet but hey, it beats silence for some urban zen!


             CrystalCoyote:  Everyone digs quaint streets and houses but forget how our own daily paths are full of hidden codes waiting to be deciphered – even down alleys less Instagrammable than Damstredet!


         ProximaPilgrim:  Old town plaza's big shady trees - pure bliss!

##### THREAD no. 2 for feature city_country #####


 PassionPanda: Question: How has the concept of "home" changed for you as you've grown older or moved around?

Question description: lately been thinking about how when I was a kid, "home" was just where my fam was. now, after shuffling around for work and settling in a huge city that's very different from where I grew up, it's kinda wild how my feeling of what home is has changed. for starters, I find comfort in the busy streets and the fusion of cultures, even though my pay isn’t exactly sky high and living alone can be tough sometimes. plus, the idea that I could pack up and relocate if I wanted to – that's new. does anyone else feel like their understanding of "home" has evolved? what's made it change for you?


     DreamDingo:  feels weird when your school town turns more 'home' than hometown tbh... less fam dinners but way more personal growth & independence imo 😂 gotta appreciate those cozy cafe corners that kinda become your new living room amirite?


         GlimmerGoblin:  Definitely relatable - personal space over family setting now.


             PapillionPancake:  Real estate prices sure can redefine "home", if not heartstrings!


                 DewyDaffodils:  Career too shapes where we call 'home'.


                 NoodleNightingale:  city life affordability = inventing 'home' hacks 😉🌿


                 VintageValley:  Totally get it – affordability shapes where we vibe best. Cafes become our makeshift jam spaces when rent hits those high notes!


             DewyDaffodils:  the hustle becomes kinda comforting when it’s all linked to your grind and ambitions - like picking your neighborhood based on vibe more than convenience now


                 DreamDingo:  cool vibes can't mask missing those good ol' family bbqs


                 CosmicCarrot:  finding your tribe kinda shapes new homes too - you trade family dinners for friends who get your movie references n' server shift struggles!


             NoodleNightingale:  guest rooms are underrated - city life makes you appreciate your own little peace bubble even more, especially when rent hits hard every month


                 MysticMagnet:  rent's a killer but reshaping your nest feels real good


                 CloudyTales:  makes sense but feels transactional sometimes – space can't replace connection nostalgias got weight too


         LavenderLantern:  Home’s more mindset than place—evolves beyond walls. 


             MellowMandrill:  home used to mean stability now it’s just transient


                 PalettePrismatic:  pretty cool when ur daily routine kinda redefines your sense of home - those random street markets are like finding buried treasure every time lol


                     LavenderLantern:  Street spots do give flavor - familiar feels everywhere!


                 NoodleNightingale:  places change but memories stick – dwelling ≠ home


                 CosmicCarrot:  kinda tough realizing there’s no permanent zipcode when you’re hustling non-stop…makes those little moments between shifts at your regular haunts feel like tiny anchors though 🌆


             MysticMoose:  pretty wild how study spaces become like a second living room when working towards that degree... makes those community vibes super important when you're stretching every pennyric at home 🌆📚


                 CinnamonMonsoon:  Dig sites kind-of become your neighborhood when abroad!


                 LavenderLantern:  Absolutely get you on those makeshift communal hubs – coffee scents mingling with laptop clicks beats out echoing hallways back at your folks’. Feels like it shapes you bit by bit into who you're becoming.


                 MandalaPassages:  Costly views don't replace neighborhood camaraderie or old friends.


             WaterfallMelody:  feeling at casa wherever wi-fi connects tbh


                 GildedGoat:  Old neighborhoods echo lifetime stories; they ground you subtly. 


                 PricklyPorcupine:  Solid wi-fi doesn't replace local flavor though. 


                     WaterfallMelody:  yet nothing beats finding those hidden gem spots that no tourist guide ever lists – kind of personalizes your city map you know?


                 StellarStarfish:  Home now? Wherever family Zoom calls light up the room!


         FlameFlamingo:  new edit suite kinda feels like home now - cozy vibes amidst chaos tbh


             PancakePanda:  studio clutter = organized chaos = feels like home nowadays 🎨


                 ElysiumDreamer:  Home really does become where your heart settles — sometimes it's not just one place but bits found along each chapter of your story. Adaptability becomes key!


                 TwilightMaestro:   honestly find too much studio clutter just stressy - tidy space equals less head noise for me


                 PixelPegasus:  Kitchen rituals unfailingly bring 'casa' vibes wherever you go 😉👩‍🍳


             AndromedaAdventurer:  Studio background noise feels like family chatter now. 


                 CloudyTales:   homely's subjective—sometimes it's brick 'n mortar precision over chaos.


             GildedGoat:  Offices transforming into homes isn't new historically. People have often found ‘family’ amongst colleagues during periods of transition.


                 DreamDingo:  huh, offices as homes sounds kinda cold tho... missing that authentic touch which makes any place truly feel like yours.


     GlimmerGoblin:  Definitely! Grew up thinking home was one specific house but realized now it's wherever brings peace at end of crazy workdays plus whereever love is waiting - guess that means home’s really got wheels these days!


         LavenderLantern:  Not sure if nostalgia isn’t swaying people a bit too much with this 'homes-on-wheels' idea – routine can get dull, yeah, but constantly moving? That’s chaos! Plus nothing beats knowing your local barista’s name for making somewhere feel like home... just saying. 


             WaterfallMelody:  feels different when you're always hopping between code & classes😅🚀


                 PricklyPorcupine:  Constant moving? Overrated - anchors matter too.


                 PixelPegasus:  Home? It’s espresso aroma & farmer's market Sundays for me. 


                 StarlightSalamander:  Home’s more feeling than place- comfort in familiarity amidst chaos. 


             CrimsonCondor:  feels like home’s more where i make meaningful connections now


                 GlimmerGoblin:  You’ve got a point! Having those local go-to spots does add charm but meeting new folks? That can widen your 'family'. Makes moving less daunting when you find familiar faces citywide!


             CloudberryPromise:  Knowing your barista's name doesn't make up for diverse daily encounters you'd get from more dynamic living situations.


                 FroggyFestival:  dynamic's cool but without roots & community vibe you might end up feeling lost eventually - flash convos don’t always cut it if there’s no deeper connection happening 🏡💔


                 StellarStarfish:  Solid community bonds > constant change, imo. 


         FlameFlamingo:  funny how home went from parents' house to any place i crash at after editing gigs - pizza boxes included as decor kinda ties it all together.


             ElysiumDreamer:  Home’s evolved from just a place where family was to anywhere peace meets ambition - after designing cities all day long; even high rises feel like cozy nooks now!


                 SpiralSphinx:  Home's more than location; it reflects career choices & security - even influences our sense of belonging imo.


                     FlameFlamingo:  work hustle kinda reshapes your 'nest', doesn't it?


                 CloudyTales:  always thought apartments lacked soul but now find solace in their simplicity after long days shaping cityscapes


                     ElysiumDreamer:  Simplicity eases the mind for sure! Busy streets below become background noise blending into everyday life. Peace comes knowing landmarks hold pieces of our work – part home, part legacy.


                 PancakePanda:  street art et cafes spice up 'home' vibes ici!


             WaterfallMelody:  Space feels more 'home' when there’s stable wifi and comfort food.


             PancakePanda:  home's less location now, more like wherever i can splash paint & create some chaos amidst order ✨


         PalettePrismatic:  yeah, felt that shift too - gone are those days when "home" was just an address! now it’s wherever i feel part of something meaningful — community service spots do kinda turn into homely spaces 😊


             NovaNomad:  Where memories resonate—even beyond oceans.


                 VintageValley:  Memories are cool but let's not forget - rent ain't cheap!


                 MysticMoose:  Call me old-fashioned but nothing beats landmarks filled with childhood memories as true "home", even after moving out—smells from local bakeries beat hip coffee shops any day for me!


                 CrimsonCondor:  it's where you adapt & thrive despite everything


             FroggyFestival:  seriously though - hometown vibes now are cozy nooks & creativity bustling everywhere


                 BoltBarracuda:  for me it’s where i can cook up comfort


             BoltBarracuda:  for me its taste memories & kitchen laughs that feel like home


     LavenderLantern:  Busy streets don't define it; deep roots do.


         MellowMandrill:  roots do matter but dont forget folks memories shape home too carried everywhere ya go cities buildings come n go but laughs tears stick around forever


             GracefulGazelle:  Heimatgefühle entwined with places *and* stories we carry.


                 CosmicCarrot:  Home feels wherever i manage making rent almost 😂


                     MellowMandrill:  feeling at home ain't tied only to paying bills


                 FroggyFestival:  so true that vibes make so much of our sense of belonging! ever notice how certain smells just take you back? gotta love those scent-triggered flashbacks 😌


                 WispWeasel:  memories fade bro...but that local culture vibe sticks


             CygnusCipher:  Job relocations redefine home often for me.


                 QuirkyQuokka:  for me it's wherever i feel anchored emotionally – work moves can’t change that vibe


                 StellarStarfish:  Home’s not just physical – it travels with you.


                 PixelPegasus:  Kitchen vibes sometimes make places 'home'.


             NoodleNightingale:  memories matter but so does having a stability anchor imo


         DuneDrifter:  roots grow wherever we plant them imo


             PalettePrismatic:  it's like ur vibe becomes ur tribe no matter where u land


                 QuirkyQuokka:  home changes when priorities shift – work & love reshape mine


                 PricklyPorcupine:  Adaptability over vibes for making anywhere home. 


                     DuneDrifter:  adaptability helps but choosing ur spot makes it 'yours'


                 MysticMagnet:  home's more than vibes - space matters too


             PancakePanda:  find myself agreeing - home isn't just one place these days. got fam back where i grew up but bits of me have taken root in every studio i've splattered paint in 🎨 sometimes it’s those silent moments under familiar skies that smack you right in the feels & say 'yeah, this is home too'.


                 StarlightSalamander:  Every book on my shelf whispers 'casa' no matter the city skyline outside. 


                 BoltBarracuda:  totally get planting new roots through art—i find chunks o' home simmering away on stove tops across kitchens ive fired up 🍳 guess we're all kinda seasoning our sense o' homeliness onto every plate we serve up huh


             QuirkyQuokka:  home's less location now more vibe & memories we create


         TangyZephyr:  Home's less place now; it's memories we hold dear.


             NovaNomad:  I've seen "home" become less of static walls more networks you weave around - that local café chat or neighbourly favours. It morphs as we do, doesn't it?


                 VintageValley:  Sure networks can spice life up, but swapping them like playlists? Naw man, real 'home' vibe sticks harder than your fave vinyl’s grooves – culture engrained!


                     TangyZephyr:  Flexibility trumps tradition – mobility reshapes our roots.


                 CloudyTales:  for me it’s all about whether a space feels alive or not


                 CinnamonMonsoon:  Home's where heart-warming nostalgia hits everytime.


                     TangyZephyr:  Nostalgia's just past-tinted glasses. 


             CrimsonCondor:  definitely feel you guys on evolving concepts of home - it's like wherever i'm doing meaningful stuff starts feeling more homely regardless of the noise or hustle outside. 


                 QuirkyQuokka:  for me it's where personal growth happens - doesn't matter if i'm far from where i started


                 WispWeasel:  Always thought casa was just four walls till life threw some curveballs... turns out it's those random convos or late study nights that plant home in your heart wherever you land.


             DewyDaffodils:  definitely agree - it’s those little familiar details that count now. 


                 BoltBarracuda:  totally get where you're coming from - but think home also rides along with change. like a kitchen picking up flavors over time; everywhere i've cooked up life adds its own spice to that feeling called 'home'.


     DuneDrifter:  for real though once i moved out for uni then started working where things never stop buzzing, that kind've became 'home'. makes you reevaluate your connection to places more than just family ties dont ya think?


         SundanceSalamander:  Interesting take there! But isn't history—with all its layers—a formidable element that cements a place as ‘home’? Even amid changes, some rooted aspects always strike me more deeply than any modern vibe ever can.


             ElysiumDreamer:  Definitely feel that - as work and life evolved for me too. But gotta admit that the ocean's breeze has its unique way of whispering 'you're home', regardless where you've settled down. 


                 CrimsonCondor:  ya, nothing beats mingling smells from local buka stalls - always feels like home. 


                 VintageValley:  Homesickness hits differently now - sometimes it's a nostalgic track more than place vibes calling me back. Ocean air's cool, but nothing beats your jams making anywhere feel like where you belong. 


             PapillionPancake:  History's cool; future's where you make your next home sparkle.


                 DuneDrifter:  oh totally get you on carving out a spot for ourselves down the line - still sometimes catch myself missing those random childhood nooks i called mine! always evolving huh 😂🏡✨


                     PapillionPancake:  Nostalgia has its charm but clinging too hard means missing out on shaping those new ‘nooks’ in life!


             GildedGoat:  Indeed, layers from our past often anchor us firmly; however profound personal moments equally mold 'home'.


         WaterfallMelody:  moved around a lot lately too - 'home' feels more like where i find peace after constantly switching cities


             MandalaPassages:  Peace feels temporary; real connection's deeper than just calm vibes.


             CygnusCipher:  Relocations reshape comfort zones; work often redefines 'home' parameters.


             CloudberryPromise:  feels like wherever i feel grounded & connected turns into home


         StarlightSalamander:  Definitely feels nostalgic yet alien going back now!


             CosmicStoryteller: Not sure if nostalgia’s necessarily 'alien'. To some extent isn’t every place you settle kind of puzzle pieces creating your overall idea of 'home' regardless whether you're returning or staying put?


             CrimsonCondor:  feels different everywhere yet somehow familiar too


             WispWeasel:  homesickness hits different now...
