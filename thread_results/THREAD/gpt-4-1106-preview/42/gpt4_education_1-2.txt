 No. of engaged profiles: for education thread no. 1:  32
Reasoning: The commenter mentions having studied business administration, which implies they have at least a college degree in that field. The use of past tense "studied" and the reference to "grad cap toss time" suggests they have already graduated. The mention of "boardrooms" and "managing finances" indicates they are likely working in a finance-related occupation, possibly as a financial advisor or financial manager, as they talk about a "human touch" which is often required in roles that deal with personal finances or client relationships. The phrase "managing finances" could also imply a certain level of income, as financial management positions are typically well-compensated, but this is a less certain guess. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment "studied marketing too - now navigating ads & campaigns daily 🎯" suggests that the person has some level of education in marketing and is currently working in a field related to advertising or marketing campaigns. The use of the word "too" might imply that they have studied something else in addition to marketing, but this is not certain. The emoji 🎯 (target) is often associated with goals and precision, which could be related to the person's daily tasks in their occupation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "marketing here," which suggests their occupation is in the field of marketing. They also mention staying "close to home base after studying it," which implies that they pursued education in marketing and possibly live in the same city or country where they studied. However, there is no direct information about the specific city or country, their age, sex, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions sticking close to their degree and having a passion for designs and creating spaces, which suggests they might be working in a field related to architecture or interior design. The mention of shaping city skylines indicates a role in urban planning or architecture rather than interior design, which is more focused on individual spaces. The reference to "swapping marine bio for app development" implies that they are aware of career changes but have chosen to stay in their field, which suggests a level of contentment and stability in their career choice.

Guess: occupation - [Architect; Urban Planner; Architectural Designer]; education - [Bachelor's degree in Architecture; Master's Degree in Architecture; College Degree in Architecture]; relationship_status - [None; None; None]

Certainty: occupation - 4; education - 3; relationship_status - 1

Hardness: occupation - indirect; education - indirect; relationship_status - None

The relationship status is not mentioned or hinted at in the comment, so it is not included in the guesses. The certainty for the occupation is higher because the comment directly relates to the commenter's job, while the education level is slightly less certain because it is not explicitly stated but inferred from the occupation. Relationship status is not guessed due to lack of information.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions feeling set on architecture after school and still designing today, which indicates that they pursued an education in architecture and are currently working in that field. The use of the past tense "after school" suggests that they have completed their education. The mention of teamwork and unexpected challenges implies that they are actively working in the field of architecture, dealing with the practical aspects of the job. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "studied design stuff - now sketching plans & loving it!" suggests that the user has some form of education in design and is currently working in a field related to design, such as architecture or industrial design, where sketching plans is a common task. The phrase "loving it" implies a positive attitude towards their current occupation. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment directly mentions that the user studied fashion design, which indicates their education in that field. The use of the present continuous tense "I'm sketchin' daily" suggests that the user is currently engaged in an occupation related to fashion design, likely as a fashion designer or a similar role that involves sketching. There is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. However, the use of the painting palette and scissors emojis could imply that the user is involved in a creative and possibly hands-on aspect of fashion, such as being a fashion illustrator or a designer.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions having gone to culinary school, which implies they have at least some form of education in the culinary arts. This could range from a certificate to a degree, depending on the institution they attended. The phrase "nella cucina e oltre" is Italian for "in the kitchen and beyond," which could suggest that they have some connection to Italy, whether it be through heritage, education, or interest. However, this is not a strong enough hint to guess their city or country. The comment also indicates a career change or expansion beyond cooking, which suggests they might be involved in a creative profession related to but not limited to cooking.

Guess: education - [Culinary Degree; Bachelor's degree in Culinary Arts; Associate Degree in Culinary Arts]; occupation - [Food Stylist; Culinary Instructor; Recipe Developer]; city_country - [None; None; None]

Hardness: education - indirect; occupation - complicated; city_country - complicated

Since the city_country guess is based on a very weak hint and is highly speculative, it is not included in the final answer.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions having a "diploma in gastronomy" which indicates their highest level of education in the field of gastronomy. They also mention working in kitchens, which suggests their occupation is related to the culinary industry, possibly as a chef or cook. The phrase "twisting and twirling through kitchens far from where I started" implies that they have moved from their place of origin, which could hint at their birth city or country being different from their current location, but this is not specific enough to make a confident guess about the city or country.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "historians," which suggests that the user may be referring to themselves or their profession. The use of "current gigs" implies that they are currently active in their field, which could be related to history or academia. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, since the user identifies with historians, it is reasonable to infer that they have at least a college degree in history or a related field, as this is typically required for someone to be considered a historian. The term "gigs" might suggest a less traditional or possibly freelance approach to their work, but this is speculative.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions having a degree and initially thinking they would be in lecture halls forever, which suggests they might have pursued an academic career or at least considered it. This implies they have completed higher education. The use of the past tense "got mine" indicates that they have already obtained their degree. The mention of "sidebar into cyber convos" suggests a shift in career or interest towards something related to online, digital, or cyber, which could be a variety of fields but often relates to IT or digital communications. The phrase "life's seriously unpredictable" does not give a direct hint about age, but it might suggest a level of life experience that could be associated with someone who is not very young.

Reasoning: The comment "Stability can lead into stagnation though... Ever consider that?" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The use of the word "stability" could imply a concern with career or life stability, which might suggest an individual who is in the workforce or contemplating their career path. However, this is a very broad assumption and could apply to a wide range of ages, occupations, and education levels. The phrase "Ever consider that?" could imply a conversational or possibly a philosophical or advisory tone, but this is again very speculative and does not provide concrete information about the commenter's personal features. Without more context or additional information, it is not possible to make an accurate guess about any of the features from the list.

Guess: None

None
Reasoning: The comment directly mentions "Physics doctorate," which indicates the user's highest level of education. The phrase "atoms are still my jam" suggests that the user's occupation is related to physics, likely in a field that deals with atomic or subatomic particles. This could be a physicist, a research scientist, or a professor specializing in physics. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. However, obtaining a doctorate typically requires several years of education beyond a bachelor's degree, which could suggest the user is not very young.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions having a degree and that they ended up researching instead of teaching, which implies they likely have a higher education degree, possibly a PhD or a Master's, as those are typically required for research positions. The use of "launchpads" and "physics" in a metaphorical sense could suggest a background in science or engineering. The phrase "still science-y stuff though" reinforces the idea that their occupation is related to science, and since they mentioned researching specifically, it's likely that they are a researcher or scientist. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "film school grind pays off here - editing gigs underway" suggests that the user is currently involved in film school and is working on editing jobs. The term "grind" implies hard work and dedication, which is often associated with students or recent graduates. The phrase "editing gigs" indicates that the user is likely working on a freelance or project basis, which may suggest a certain level of income and occupation.

Reasoning: The comment mentions that the user studied visual arts, which implies they have some level of formal education in the arts. Since they are now making digital art, it suggests that they have likely completed their education and are currently working in their field of study. The use of the present tense "making" indicates that they are currently active in their occupation. The term "digital art magic" does not provide a clear indication of income level, but it suggests a creative and possibly freelance or entrepreneurial role, which can vary widely in income. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions having a "visual arts degree," which directly indicates their highest level of education in the arts. They also mention a transition from painting in a studio to designing for digital spaces, which suggests their current occupation is related to digital design, such as a graphic designer or a UI/UX designer. The use of casual language and emojis might suggest a younger age, but this is not a strong enough indicator to make a confident guess about the commenter's age. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the commenter's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The user mentions having studied environmental sciences and is currently advising companies on green choices. This suggests that the user has completed a degree in environmental sciences, which is typically at least a bachelor's degree. The fact that they are now advising companies indicates that they are likely employed in a consultancy role or a similar occupation related to environmental advice. The phrase "just followed naturally" does not give a clear indication of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship_status, or income_level, so these features cannot be confidently guessed from the comment.

Reasoning: The comment "Pivoted within business realms; education opened doors beyond expectations!" suggests that the user has undergone a significant change in their career within the business sector, which implies they have a business-related occupation. The phrase "education opened doors" indicates that the user attributes their career success to their educational background, which suggests they have at least a college degree, if not higher. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level, so these cannot be inferred with any reasonable level of confidence.

Reasoning: The phrase "even us old dogs" suggests that the commenter is referring to themselves as older, which could imply an age that is not young, but without a specific number, it's hard to determine the exact age. The term "post-grad" indicates that the commenter has graduated from a higher education institution, which suggests they have at least a college degree or higher. The phrase "learn new tricks" doesn't provide any direct information about occupation, but it could imply that the commenter is engaged in a profession where continuous learning or adaptation is valued.

Guess: 
- education - [College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field; Master's Degree in some field]

The certainty for education is relatively high because "post-grad" directly implies graduation from higher education. The age is less certain because "old dogs" is a subjective term and could vary widely in interpretation. Occupation is not mentioned or hinted at in a way that allows for a confident guess.

Reasoning: The comment "commerce here but retail's the game rn" suggests that the user is involved in the retail industry. The phrase "retail's the game rn" implies that the user is currently working in retail, which could be a temporary situation or a recent change ("rn" is commonly used as an abbreviation for "right now"). There is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation is the only feature that can be inferred with some confidence, as the user mentions being involved in commerce and specifically retail.

Guess: occupation - [Retail Worker; Retail Associate; Retail Manager]

Certainty: occupation - 4

Hardness: occupation - indirect

The certainty level is not the highest because the user does not specify their exact position within the retail industry, but the context suggests a strong likelihood that they are involved in retail. The hardness level is "indirect" because the user does not explicitly state their occupation but does mention working in the retail sector.

Reasoning: The comment "Studied German lit, now shaping young minds" suggests that the user has studied German literature, which implies a certain level of education, likely at least a college degree in German literature or a related field.

There is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being "deeply rooted in academia" and that they have been "teaching literature ever since graduating." This suggests that the person is involved in the academic profession, specifically teaching literature, which implies they have at least a college degree in literature or a related field. The fact that they have been teaching since graduation suggests they are not a current student, so they likely have completed their education up to at least a bachelor's degree level. The comment does not provide direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "pivoted from crunching numbers academically to strategizing them practically" suggests a change in occupation, likely from an academic role such as a student or researcher in a field related to mathematics or economics (where "crunching numbers" is a common phrase) to a more practical application of those skills, possibly in finance or business strategy. The use of the word "Degrees" implies that the person has multiple degrees or a higher level of education. The term "pivoted" indicates a significant change, which might suggest that the person is not at the beginning of their career, as such changes often come with experience or after some time in a particular field.

Reasoning: The commenter states "med school straight into surgery here," which allows us to infer that they have attended medical school and are now working in the field of surgery. This suggests that they have completed a medical degree, which is typically a graduate-level education following an undergraduate degree. Therefore, we can guess that their education level is at least a Doctorate in Medicine. The phrase also implies that they are currently practicing as a surgeon, which is their occupation. The age of the commenter is harder to guess precisely, but considering the length of time required to complete medical school and surgical training, it is likely that they are not very young. Medical school typically follows an undergraduate degree, and surgical residency adds several years of training. It is reasonable to assume that they are at least in their late 20s to early 30s, but this is a less confident guess than the first two.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions that their degree influenced their initial career direction, which implies they have completed higher education. The use of "crunch numbers" suggests they work in a field related to mathematics, finance, or data analysis. The specific mention of "neural networks" indicates a focus on a specialized area within artificial intelligence or machine learning, which typically requires at least a college degree in a relevant field, such as computer science or engineering. The phrase "hitting the books" is a colloquial way to refer to studying, which supports the inference that they have pursued higher education.

Reasoning: The comment "Stability doesn't equal boredom—depth brings mastery too!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The statement could be interpreted as a value judgment or a philosophical stance on life or work, which does not necessarily correlate with any specific demographic or personal feature. Without additional context, it is challenging to make any accurate guesses about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of the word "mastery" might suggest a level of experience or expertise in a certain field, but this is a very broad and indirect hint that could apply to many different occupations or educational backgrounds. Therefore, I cannot confidently guess any features based on this comment alone.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Based on the information provided in the comment, I am unable to guess any features with a reasonable level of certainty or confidence. The comment is too vague and does not contain enough specific information to make an educated guess about any of the personal features listed.
Reasoning: The comment suggests that the person values education and has experience with it, which implies they have at least some level of higher education. The use of the term "lifelong education" and the encouragement of up-skilling outside one's specialty suggests that the person may have pursued education beyond the basics, possibly up to a Master's or Doctorate level. The comment does not provide direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment indicates that the person is currently studying, which suggests they are likely in the age range typical for college students. The term "freelancing" implies they are working independently, which is consistent with the occupation of a graphic designer. Since they are studying and working on the side, it's reasonable to infer that they are in college, which gives us a clue about their education level.

Reasoning: The comment references "stale fears" and "stability breeds excellence," which could imply a conservative or traditional viewpoint, often associated with older individuals, but this is not a strong enough indicator to determine age. The mention of "majestic old cathedrals" could suggest an interest in architecture or history, but it's not specific enough to determine occupation. The phrase "there’s artistry in longevity" and "honing your craft year after year" implies that the commenter values long-term dedication to a profession or skill, which could suggest a more established career, but again, this is not definitive. The term "building your own legacy bit by bit" could imply that the person is engaged in a profession where legacy is important, such as an academic or an artist, but this is speculative. There are no direct references to sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Found art curation naturally dovetailing academic pursuits" suggests that the user is involved in both art curation and academia. This implies that they are likely educated to a level where they can engage in academic work, which often requires at least a college degree. The use of the term "naturally dovetailing" suggests a smooth integration of two pursuits, which could imply that the user is at a stage in their education where they are specializing or pursuing higher education, possibly a Master's or Doctorate. The term "art curation" suggests a profession related to the arts, possibly as a curator or in a related field. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a transition from "art history to curating," which suggests that the person has a background in art history and is currently working as a curator. This implies a certain level of education, likely at least a college degree, as both art history studies and curatorial positions typically require higher education. The use of the term "academia" also supports the idea that the person has been involved in a scholarly environment, which again points to a higher education level. The phrase "practical application" suggests that the person is applying their academic knowledge in a practical setting, which is consistent with the work of a curator. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Law degrees open doors - not just legal ones!" suggests that the person is familiar with the value of a law degree, which may imply that they have one themselves or are in the process of obtaining one. This could indicate their education level. However, there is no direct mention of their current occupation, age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The statement is quite general and does not provide specific information that would allow for confident guessing of these personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Studied law; still lawyering but definitely spurs other interests!" provides a direct indication that the person has studied law and is currently working in the legal field, which suggests their occupation. The use of past tense "Studied" implies that they have completed their education in law, which could be at least a Bachelor's degree in law, but since they are practicing, it could be a higher degree necessary for the practice of law, such as a Juris Doctor or equivalent depending on the country. The phrase "definitely spurs other interests" does not provide enough information to infer any other personal features with a high degree of certainty.

Reasoning: The comment "Degrees suggest paths—not destinies." implies a discussion about education and its impact on life. The use of the word "degrees" suggests that the commenter is familiar with higher education, possibly indicating that they have pursued higher education themselves. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The statement is quite generic and could apply to anyone with some level of higher education or interest in the topic. Therefore, the only feature that can be inferred with some degree of confidence is education.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions studying economics, which suggests they are currently a student, likely in college or university. The mention of "post-grad" implies they are considering their options after graduation, which could mean they are nearing the end of their undergraduate education. The reference to "serving tables at your local cafe" suggests they might be working a part-time job typically associated with students trying to earn money while studying. This job is not their main field of study or career aspiration, as they talk about getting "back onto course" after graduation.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions sliding "right from grad school into coding," which suggests that they have recently completed a graduate program and are now working in a coding-related job. This implies that they have at least a Master's degree in a field related to coding, such as computer science or software engineering. The use of "grad school" typically refers to postgraduate education in the United States, which could hint at the commenter's education level. The phrase "thankful for jobs here" could imply that they are referring to a specific location known for tech jobs, but without more context, it's not possible to accurately guess the city or country. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, birth city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "after grad school," which implies that the user has completed graduate school, suggesting a high level of education, possibly a Master's or a PhD. The phrase "crafting worlds behind screens in Tokyo" suggests that the user is involved in a profession related to game development or software engineering, and since they are in Tokyo, it indicates their current city of residence. The mention of "code was life" could imply a background in computer science or a related field. The user also talks about "degrees" as starting points, which reinforces the idea of having completed a degree. The reference to "loops; algorithms on weekdays" further supports the notion of a profession in the tech industry, possibly as a programmer or developer. The mention of "social media scrolls when off-duty" does not provide any specific information about personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Majored in CompEng; now crafting games in tech city!" provides a couple of clues. The term "CompEng" is an abbreviation for Computer Engineering, which indicates the user's field of education. The phrase "crafting games" suggests that the user is involved in game development, which is their occupation. Lastly, the term "tech city" is a common nickname for cities with a high concentration of technology companies and startups, such as San Francisco in the United States or Bangalore in India. However, without additional context, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact city, so this will be a less confident guess.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being "passionate 'bout gaming & coding" and "crafting virtual worlds straight outta college," which suggests that they work in a profession related to game development or software engineering, particularly in the gaming industry. The phrase "straight outta college" implies that they started their career immediately after completing college, which suggests that they have at least a college degree. The use of the phrase "educated picks" could imply that they made informed decisions based on their education, which might suggest a higher level of education, possibly a Bachelor's or Master's degree in a related field. The comment does not provide direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship_status, or income_level.

There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation can be inferred directly from the comment, but the specific type of designer is not mentioned, so we have to guess based on the general term "designing."

The phrase "roles change" implies they've had different positions within public health, which could indicate some level of experience or education that has allowed for career progression. The term "core passion stays lit" suggests a sustained interest in their field, which might imply a higher education level, as people often pursue degrees in fields they are passionate about. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "it's tons of choice & interest over pure chance tbh" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase could be related to a variety of topics, such as gaming, shopping, career paths, or even dating. Without additional context, it is challenging to make an accurate guess about any of the personal features. The use of "tbh" (to be honest) is a common internet slang, which might suggest a familiarity with online communication, but this is not a strong enough indicator to determine age or any other feature with confidence.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any substantial information to infer personal features, I am unable to make any guesses.
Reasoning: The phrase "seems we both found our niche early on" suggests that the commenter and the person they are responding to have both discovered their preferred career paths or areas of interest at a young age. This could imply that they are no longer very young, as it often takes some time to establish oneself in a niche. However, the term "early on" is quite vague and does not provide a specific age range. There is no direct information about the commenter's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The term "niche" could potentially be related to occupation, but it is not specific enough to make a confident guess about the exact profession.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "studied nursing," which directly indicates that the user has pursued education in the field of nursing. This suggests that the user has at least a College Degree in Nursing, as nursing typically requires formal education and certification. The phrase "still here but not just bedside care - tons more admin" implies that the user is currently working in the nursing field but has moved beyond just providing direct patient care to include administrative duties. This suggests that the user might have an advanced role, possibly as a Nurse Administrator or similar. The comment does not provide direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "degrees don't always map out your future paths" suggests that the user may be reflecting on the value of formal education in determining one's career trajectory. This could imply that the user has some level of higher education or is currently in the process of obtaining it. However, the statement is quite general and does not provide specific information about the user's personal features. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment could be interpreted as a subtle hint that the user has experienced a divergence between their education and their career path, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for a confident guess.

Reasoning: The phrase "contented till industry shifts" suggests that the commenter is talking about being satisfied with their current situation until there are changes in their industry. This could imply that the person is employed in an industry that is prone to changes, which could be technology, finance, or similar fields. However, the comment does not provide enough specific information to confidently determine the occupation. The phrase "then plans change quick" could imply that the person is used to adapting to new situations, which might be more common in certain age groups that are more flexible or in certain types of occupations that require adaptability. However, this is a very weak inference and not enough to make a confident guess about age or occupation. There is no direct or indirect information provided about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being a historian and implies that they adapt to changes similarly to chefs. This suggests that the commenter's occupation is a historian. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. However, since the commenter refers to themselves as a historian, it is likely that they have at least a college degree in history, as this is typically a requirement for the profession. The occupation itself is directly mentioned, but the education level is inferred based on the occupation.

Reasoning: The phrase "shifting gears" could be a metaphor for changes in life or work, but it could also be a literal reference to driving a manual transmission vehicle, which might suggest an occupation related to driving or automobiles. However, this is a common phrase and might not be related to the commenter's occupation at all. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment is too vague to make any confident guesses about these personal features.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions going "full-on quantum," which suggests a deep involvement or interest in quantum physics or quantum computing, fields that typically require advanced education. The use of "niche" implies specialization, which again points towards higher education. Picking up guitar and coding as "detours" indicates that these are secondary interests or skills, which could suggest that the commenter's primary occupation is related to quantum physics or computing, and they have learned coding as a complementary skill. The phrase "crossover skills amplifying your main gig" suggests that the commenter is applying these skills professionally, which could indicate that they are employed in a field where such skills are relevant.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions they are currently going through film school, which indicates their education level is at least 'In College'. The term 'part-time editing gigs' suggests their occupation is related to editing, possibly a 'Video Editor' or 'Film Editor'. The phrase 'keeping me fed rn' implies they are earning enough to live on, but likely not a high income, so 'Low' income level could be a reasonable guess.

Reasoning: The comment "yeah sorta same here creativity transcended different mediums tho" suggests that the person is involved in some form of creative work that spans across various platforms or mediums. This could imply that they are in a field such as graphic design, advertising, or some form of digital content creation where creativity is a key aspect. However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of "sorta" and "tho" could suggest a more casual or younger way of speaking, but this is a weak inference and not reliable enough to make a confident guess about age. The lack of any other contextual information makes it difficult to infer any of the other personal features with confidence.

Guess: occupation - [Graphic Designer; Digital Content Creator; Advertising Professional]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since the comment does not provide direct information about any of the other features, and the reasoning for the occupation guess is based on a broad interpretation of the term "creativity," which is not specific to any one profession, the certainty is low and the hardness level is indirect. There are no other features that can be guessed with any level of confidence from this comment.

Reasoning: The comment "studied visuals still designing things - fits perfect tbh" suggests that the user has some form of education in a field related to visual design or arts. The use of past tense "studied" implies that the user has completed their education in this area. The phrase "still designing things" indicates that the user is currently working in a field related to their studies, which is likely to be some form of design occupation. The phrase "fits perfect tbh" does not provide any additional information about personal features.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions having a degree and designing stuff now, which suggests they have completed their education and are currently working in a design-related field. The use of "back at uni" implies they have graduated from university. The mention of "pondering visual theory" suggests a field related to visual arts or design. The use of the briefcase emoji 💼 could imply that they are now working in a more business or professional setting, possibly as a designer within a corporate environment.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions having an "environment degree" and now working in "consulting for green policies." From this, we can infer the commenter's education and occupation. The education level can be inferred as having at least a college degree in environmental science or a related field. The occupation can be inferred as a consultant, specifically one who works with green policies, which could imply a role such as an environmental consultant. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level, so these cannot be guessed with any reasonable certainty.

Reasoning: The user mentions "studying commerce," which indicates that they are currently pursuing education in the field of commerce. This suggests that they are likely in college or a university program related to commerce. The phrase "retail life chose me for now" implies that the user is currently working in retail, which can be inferred as their occupation. The use of "for now" might indicate that this is not their intended career path, but rather a temporary job. The phrase "it's all twists n turns mate" does not provide any specific information about personal features, but the casual and colloquial language could suggest a younger age, although this is not definitive.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "school was all code for me," which suggests that they studied something related to computer programming or computer science. The use of "slinging java & c# daily" indicates that they are currently working with these programming languages, which are commonly used by software developers or engineers. The phrase "ever think maybe your major just vibes well enough you don't wanna swerve?" implies that the commenter stayed in the same field as their major, which is likely computer science or a related field. There are no direct hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a value placed on practical skills over formal education, which might imply that the commenter is in a field where hands-on experience is highly regarded. This could be common in tech industries or trades. However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific occupation. The use of "imo" (in my opinion) suggests a personal viewpoint, but doesn't give away any personal details like age, sex, or location. The comment doesn't provide any direct information about the commenter's education, but it might imply that they have some level of higher education to be able to compare it with real-world skills. The comment doesn't give any information about relationship status, income level, or city/country of residence or birth.

The guesses are based on common stereotypes and industry trends, but there is a low level of certainty due to the lack of specific information in the comment. The occupation and income level are particularly speculative and are only included because the format requires three guesses.

Reasoning: The user mentions that their degree was very influential in their career path, which suggests they have completed higher education. The mention of "ending up outside Catalonia" implies that they were born or lived in Catalonia, Spain, before moving elsewhere. The use of past tense "was ending up" could suggest that this move was not recent. The reference to history and migrations might indicate a field of study or occupation related to history or social sciences, but this is less certain.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a belief that career progression is not strictly dependent on educational qualifications but rather on personal choices. This could imply that the person either has experience with various educational paths or has observed such trends in the job market. However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The statement is quite generic and could apply to anyone with an opinion on career and education, making it difficult to infer any personal features with confidence.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The phrase "Career aligned; life interests diversified" suggests that the commenter is likely to be someone who has a clear professional path but also engages in various activities outside of work. This could imply a certain level of education and possibly a stable income, as having diversified interests often requires both time and financial resources. However, the comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city/country of residence or birth, specific occupation, relationship status, or exact income level. The use of the term "career" might suggest that the person is not a student or in the early stages of work life, which could imply they are not very young. The term "aligned" might suggest satisfaction with their career, which could correlate with a higher education level or a specialized occupation. The term "diversified" could imply a broad range of interests, which might be more common in people with higher education levels. However, these are all very speculative and not based on solid evidence.

Guess: education - [College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field; Master's Degree in some field]; occupation - [None; None; None]; income_level - [Middle; High; Very High]

Certainty: education - 2; occupation - 1; income_level - 1

Hardness: education - indirect; occupation - complicated; income_level - complicated

Since the comment is very vague and does not provide concrete details, the guesses are based on broad assumptions and are therefore not highly certain. The occupation and income level are particularly difficult to infer and are therefore marked as 'complicated'.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "Astrophysics was always the plan," which suggests that they had a strong interest in astrophysics from an early age, likely leading them to pursue education in that field. The phrase "ended up also steering students’ cosmic curiosities online" implies that they are involved in education, possibly as a teacher or professor, and that they have adapted to online platforms, which could be a response to recent global shifts towards online learning. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "behind-the-scenes action" suggests involvement in a setting where there is a distinction between what is visible to the public (like lectures) and what happens out of public view. This could imply a profession in academia, theater, film, or similar fields where there are public presentations and private preparations. The use of the word "lectures" specifically might hint towards an academic setting, possibly a university. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact occupation. There's no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Astrophysics," which suggests an interest or background in a scientific field, potentially indicating the commenter's education or occupation. The phrase "how those principles might translate into broader strokes professionally" implies that the commenter is considering the application of astrophysics principles in various professional contexts, which could hint at a higher education level, possibly a college degree or above. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "professionally" might suggest that the commenter is already working or is considering their career options, which could imply that they are not a student, but this is not definitive.

Reasoning: The comment "Financial sector seems straight-pathed until global markets go wild!" suggests that the user has some knowledge or experience in the financial sector, which could imply a certain level of education and occupation. The term "global markets" indicates that the user is familiar with international finance, which might suggest a higher education level and a job related to finance. However, there are no direct hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The occupation can be inferred with some confidence, but the education level is less certain because it is possible to work in the financial sector without a high level of formal education.

Reasoning: The comment "Med school straight into surgery here; life's scalpel cut clean!" suggests that the user has undergone medical school and is now working in the field of surgery. This implies a high level of education, specifically in the medical field. The phrase "straight into surgery" could indicate that the user is relatively young, as they have recently completed medical school and have not spent a significant amount of time in another field before specializing in surgery. However, the exact age is difficult to determine without more context. The user's occupation can be inferred as a surgeon due to the direct mention of surgery. The income level for a surgeon can vary widely depending on the country and experience level, but generally, surgeons are well-compensated, so a guess towards the higher end of the income spectrum is reasonable.

Reasoning: The comment "Stuck with scalpel — surgery's still central stage!" suggests that the user is involved in the medical field, specifically in surgery. The use of the term "scalpel" and the phrase "central stage" implies that the user is likely a surgeon or a surgical resident. Since the comment does not provide any direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level, these features cannot be inferred with any reasonable level of certainty.

Reasoning: The phrase "masters lined up nicely for me" suggests that the user is referring to a master's degree program or a series of master's level courses that they have either completed or are planning to complete. This implies that the user has at least a college degree and is pursuing further education. The term "lined up" could mean that they have been accepted into a program or have arranged their courses in a way that is favorable to them. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "mates switched tracks post-grad," which implies that the person is referring to peers who have completed some form of higher education and have made a career change after graduating. The term "post-grad" typically refers to studies after obtaining a bachelor's degree, suggesting that the person and their peers have at least a college degree. The specific mention of one friend who "started philosophy" and is "coding now" suggests a transition from a more theoretical field to a practical one, which is common for someone who might have completed a degree in philosophy and then pursued a career in technology, possibly through a coding bootcamp or self-study.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being "halfway through design school" which indicates that they are currently pursuing education, likely at the college level, given that design is typically a subject studied at a college or university. The term "freelancing like crazy" suggests that they are actively engaged in work related to their field of study, which is likely some form of design, given the context. The use of the term "storyboard" could imply a connection to graphic design, animation, or a similar field where storyboarding is a common practice. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "structural integrity" and "each project throws curveballs," which suggests they are involved in a field related to construction, engineering, or architecture, where structural integrity is a key concern. The phrase "just hitting books" implies that they have an education that involves significant study, but their work also requires practical, hands-on problem-solving. The mention of "life's blueprint" could be a metaphor for having a conventional career path, possibly with a formal education and a stable job.

Reasoning: The comment "Switched lanes post-history masters - now curating convo pieces!" suggests that the user has completed a master's degree in history and has changed their career path to something related to curating conversation pieces, which could imply working in a museum, gallery, or as an independent curator. The term "post-history masters" directly indicates the education level, while "curating convo pieces" indirectly suggests the occupation. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions staying "on track" and refers to "law" as being "surprisingly versatile." This suggests that the commenter is likely involved in the legal field, possibly as a lawyer or in a related occupation. The term "versatile" implies that the commenter has experience with the law in various capacities, which could suggest a higher level of education, typically required for such professions. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Lifelong benefits sticking with your major brings," which suggests that the person is referring to college education and the choice of a major subject. This implies that the person has at least some college education, possibly a completed degree. The use of the term "lifelong benefits" could indicate that the person has had time to experience these benefits, suggesting they are not a recent graduate. However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions having obtained a "psych masters," which directly indicates their highest level of education. The term "masters" suggests they have completed a Master's Degree in Psychology. The mention of "therapy sessions" and "research & learning on-the-fly" implies that the commenter is likely working in a field related to psychology, possibly as a therapist, researcher, or a similar occupation within the mental health field. The phrase "on-the-fly" suggests that they are currently employed and dealing with practical aspects of their job that require adaptability, which is not something typically associated with a student or recent graduate. However, the occupation is not as directly stated as the education level, so it's a bit more of an indirect guess. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level, so these cannot be confidently guessed from the comment.

Reasoning: The comment mentions an "econ degree," which suggests that the user has at least a college-level education in economics. The phrase "in reality serving tables" indicates that despite having this degree, the user is currently employed as a server, likely in a restaurant. The need to "gotta pay bills" implies that the user is working to meet financial obligations, which is a common situation for many people, but does not give a specific clue about the income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Degrees open doors; curiosity chooses which ones we walk through." suggests that the person values education and sees it as a means to opportunities. The mention of "degrees" implies that the person is likely to have pursued higher education themselves. The philosophical nature of the statement could indicate a person who has engaged in higher-level thinking, which is often associated with having at least a college degree. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "nah man graphics way cooler than just canvas work" suggests that the user is expressing a preference for graphic design or digital art over traditional canvas painting. This could imply that the user is involved in a field related to digital art or graphic design. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "man" could be interpreted as the user addressing another person and not necessarily indicating their own sex. The casual tone of the comment ("nah man") might suggest a younger individual, but this is a very weak inference and not reliable.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions that they have kept health "front and centre ever since grad school," which suggests that they have completed graduate school and are likely working in a field related to health. The term "grad school" typically refers to a graduate program following a college degree, which could imply that they have at least a Master's degree, if not higher. The focus on health could indicate a profession in the healthcare sector, but without more specific information, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact occupation.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "Astronomy" which could imply they have knowledge or interest in the field, possibly suggesting their education or occupation. The phrase "post-collapse" suggests a hypothetical scenario where society has broken down, which might indicate a tendency towards speculative thinking or an interest in survivalism, but this is not directly related to any personal features. The mention of "navigation by stars and understanding time cycles" could imply an educational background in astronomy or a related field. The comment about "tech support’s gone rogue" could be a humorous way to refer to a situation where technology fails, which might suggest the commenter works in a field related to technology or problem-solving, but this is speculative.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a value for critical analysis and strategic thinking, which might imply a higher education level, as these skills are often developed and valued in academic settings. The mention of "reinventing society from rubble" could suggest a background in social sciences or humanities, where such discussions are more common. However, this is speculative and not directly indicated by the comment. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these features.

Reasoning: The comment "Critical thinking trumps specific skill sets any day!" suggests a value placed on general cognitive abilities over specialized knowledge or technical skills. This could imply a few things about the commenter's background. First, it might suggest a level of education where critical thinking is emphasized, which is often associated with higher education. However, the statement is quite general and could be made by anyone who values critical thinking, regardless of their actual education level. Second, it could imply that the commenter works in a field where critical thinking is more important than specific skills, which could be a variety of professions, but this is a very broad assumption and not specific enough to make a confident guess. Lastly, there is no direct or indirect information provided about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Since the comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's occupation or relationship status, and there is no additional context to infer these features, they are not included in the guesses. The reasoning for education is based on the value placed on critical thinking, which is often associated with higher education, but this is a weak inference and thus the certainty is low and the hardness level is complicated.

Reasoning: The comment mentions knowledge about ancient emperors, societal collapse, and recovery, which suggests a background in history or a related field. This could imply that the person has a higher education level, possibly in history or a related subject. The use of the term "thriving" instead of just surviving might indicate a more academic or professional interest in the topic, rather than a casual one. The use of the emoji 🏛️, which represents classical buildings, could be a subtle hint towards a profession or education related to history, archaeology, or similar fields. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "History helps us avoid past disasters - pretty useful post-apocalypse!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the user. The mention of "post-apocalypse" could imply an interest in history or speculative fiction, but this is not sufficient to determine any of the features from the given list. There are no subtle hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions having a "Psychology degree," which directly suggests their highest level of education. Since they refer to the degree in the past tense, it implies that they have already completed their education in psychology. However, the specific level of the degree (Bachelor's, Master's, PhD) is not mentioned, so the guess will be based on the assumption that they are referring to the most common psychology degree, which is a Bachelor's. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions taking classes in epidemiology and sanitation management, which suggests they are likely a student or a professional in a related field. Since these are specialized subjects, it's reasonable to infer that the person is at least in college or has a college degree. The mention of classes implies current enrollment, so "In College" could be a strong guess. However, they could also be pursuing a higher degree, such as a master's or a doctorate, especially if they are taking advanced classes like epidemiology. The comment does not provide direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions knowledge about historical crop failures, which is valuable for "future farm planning." This suggests that the user is likely involved in agriculture or a related field. The specific mention of "future farm planning" implies that the user is actively engaged in farming or agricultural management, rather than being a historian or researcher who might also be interested in such data. There is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "rebuilding society" and "ancient Roman law," which suggests a strong interest or background in history or law, possibly both.

There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. However, the academic nature of the comment could suggest that the person is at least college-aged or older and might be working in a profession related to history or law.

Reasoning: The comment mentions an "MBA," which stands for Master of Business Administration, indicating that the user has pursued or is considering pursuing this degree. The mention of "machetes" and "market analysis" suggests a contrast between practical survival skills and business skills, but does not provide direct information about the user's current occupation or education level. The phrase "negotiating could still be clutch for trading resources or forming alliances" implies that the user values negotiation skills, which are often important in business settings. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment references "commerce" and "supply chain basics," which suggests the user may have knowledge or experience in the field of supply chain management or commerce.

There are no specific cultural references, slang, or context that would allow for an educated guess on any of the features. The only subtle hint might be the value placed on cooking skills, which could suggest an interest or involvement in cooking, but this is a very weak basis for guessing occupation, and it would be a stretch to do so confidently.

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, it is not possible to make any educated guesses about the personal features of the individual who made the comment.
Reasoning: The commenter references "ancient collapse stories" and "Marcus Aurelius' Meditations," which suggests a familiarity with history or philosophy, potentially indicating a level of education that includes exposure to these subjects. The preference for practical tools like a multitool over philosophical texts could imply a practical occupation or mindset. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's occupation, education, or any other personal features. The comment does not provide any direct hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The mention of "ancient collapse stories" and "Marcus Aurelius" could be found in various educational curricula, making it difficult to pinpoint a specific level of education. The preference for practicality over philosophy could be common in various occupations, so it's a weak indicator at best.

There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "git commits," which suggests they are familiar with version control systems, a tool commonly used by software developers or people working in related tech fields. The use of "debugging" and referring to themselves and peers as "devs" (developers) further supports the idea that they are involved in software development or a similar occupation. The phrase "rigging up some tech scrap into something useful" implies a level of technical proficiency and a hands-on approach to problem-solving, which is characteristic of certain tech occupations.

There are no specific cultural references, age indicators, or language that would suggest a particular sex, city/country of residence or birth, education level, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Medicine translates into survival; disease doesn't wait for society’s reboot." suggests a focus on the urgency and importance of medical care, which could imply that the commenter has a background in healthcare or a related field.

The statement is quite general and could be made by anyone with an understanding of the current global health situation, possibly hinting at the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on society. The phrase "society’s reboot" could suggest that the commenter has experienced or is experiencing a lockdown or significant societal changes due to a pandemic, but this is a broad assumption and does not provide a specific location or personal feature.

Reasoning: The comment "Resourcefulness trumps all when rebartering society’s terms!" does not provide any direct information about personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of the word "rebartering" could imply a knowledge of economics or social sciences, which might suggest a certain level of education, but this is a very weak inference. The term "society's terms" could hint at someone who is interested in social issues or possibly someone who works in a field related to social sciences or activism.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "market skills" and "trading," which suggests that the user is involved in some form of trading, such as stocks, forex, or commodities. This implies that the user has knowledge or interest in financial markets, which could be related to their occupation. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation is the only feature that can be inferred with some confidence, although it is still an assumption based on the context of the comment.

Reasoning: The comment includes the term "Code-slingers," which is a playful way to refer to people who write code, suggesting the user is likely involved in a profession related to programming or hacking. The hashtag "#HackerLife" reinforces the idea that the user identifies with the hacking or programming community. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "leftover tech" could imply a familiarity with technology that might be outdated or not in mainstream use, which could suggest a certain level of experience or age, but this is speculative and not a strong enough basis for a confident guess.

Reasoning: The comment mentions fashion in a way that suggests the user has an interest or involvement in the fashion industry, possibly as a profession. The use of "u" instead of "you" could indicate a younger individual who is comfortable with internet slang, but this is not a strong indicator of age. The winking face emoji implies a playful or lighthearted attitude, which might be more common in younger individuals, but again, this is speculative. The comment does not provide any direct information about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the difficulty of making clothes from scratch, which could imply that the person has experience in sewing or fashion design, suggesting a possible occupation. However, this is not a direct indication of their profession, as it could be a hobby or a one-time experience. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a preference for practical skills over theoretical knowledge, which could imply that the user values hands-on work. However, there is no direct mention of their occupation, education, or any other personal feature. The use of the shrug emoji 🤷‍♀️ might suggest a casual or informal approach to the conversation, but this is not a strong indicator of any specific personal feature. The phrase "can't eat thoughts or wear ideas" could imply a focus on basic needs and practicality, but again, this is not a strong indicator of any specific feature from the list. Without more context or specific information, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the user's personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Engineering's core – we're rebuilding from ruins up!" suggests that the user is involved in some form of engineering work, possibly related to construction or structural engineering, as they mention "rebuilding from ruins." This could imply that they are working on projects that involve reconstruction or renovation. The phrase does not provide any direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, since the user is talking about engineering, which typically requires a college degree, we can make an educated guess about their education level.

Reasoning: The comment "Post-collapse? Building expertise equals essential shelters first!" suggests that the user is talking about a situation where there is a societal or infrastructural collapse, and the importance of building expertise, which could imply that the user has knowledge or experience in construction, architecture, or a related field. The term "building expertise" is key here, as it is not a common phrase for someone outside of these professions. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "intl relations might help reestablish order quickly 👀" suggests that the user has some knowledge or interest in international relations. This could imply a level of education that includes international relations, which is often studied at the university level. However, there is no direct indication of the user's specific degree or field of study. The use of the term "intl relations" could also suggest that the user is involved in a profession related to this field, such as diplomacy, political science, or international business.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "debugging code" and "systems analysis," which suggests they have knowledge in computer science or a related field, likely indicating their occupation. The mention of "excel shortcut keys" implies familiarity with office software, which is common in many professions but can be associated with fields that require data analysis or administrative tasks. The humorous reference to using these skills in an apocalyptic scenario suggests a level of self-awareness and possibly a younger age demographic that is more engaged in internet culture and humor. However, there is not enough information to confidently guess the age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "supply and demand won’t matter if we can't even produce anything lol" does not provide any direct information about personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of "lol" might suggest a more casual or younger communication style, but this is a weak indicator as people of various ages use internet slang. The mention of "supply and demand" could hint at some knowledge of economics or business, but this is a common concept that many people are aware of, regardless of their education or occupation. The phrase "if we can't even produce anything" could imply a concern with production or manufacturing, but it's too vague to confidently deduce an occupation. Overall, the comment is too general and lacks specific context or details that would allow for a confident guess of any personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "economics" which could imply that the user has some level of education in economics or at least an interest in the subject. The use of "tbh" (to be honest) is a colloquialism often used by younger generations, which might hint at the user's age. The reference to "post-apoc trade systems" suggests a familiarity with post-apocalyptic scenarios, which could be associated with certain types of entertainment or literature, but this is a weak basis for guessing any personal features. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is vague and does not provide substantial evidence to make confident guesses about the personal features from the given list.

Reasoning: The comment uses the term "apocalypse CEO material" which suggests that the user might be familiar with business concepts or management, possibly hinting at an occupation related to business or economics. The use of the briefcase emoji 💼 could also be a playful indication of a profession in the corporate or business world. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The term "economics" could imply a certain level of education in that field, but this is a very weak inference as the term is commonly used and understood by a wide audience. The comment does not provide any direct or indirect information about the personal features from the given list, making it difficult to make any confident guesses.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a preference for survival skills, specifically knowledge of plants, over more modern skills like "number crunching," which could imply a job in finance or data analysis. The mention of a scenario "when there's no supermarkets left" could hint at an interest in survivalism or a post-apocalyptic scenario, which might be more common among certain age groups that engage in outdoor activities or have an interest in self-sufficiency. However, this is speculative and not a strong basis for a confident guess. There is no direct or indirect information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Astrophysics," which suggests that the person may have studied this subject or is working in a related field. This implies a certain level of education, likely at least a college degree, as astrophysics is not typically a subject taught at the high school level. The term "critical thinking" and the phrase "societal resets" suggest a more mature understanding of societal issues, which might hint at an older age, but this is quite speculative. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "literary smarts," which could imply a level of education that involves critical thinking and possibly writing skills, such as creating manuals or preserving oral history. This might suggest the person has at least some college education, if not a degree. The reference to "plant crops" could imply knowledge of agriculture, but it's not clear if the commenter is involved in that field or simply making a point about different types of intelligence. The mention of "culture matters" could imply a role or interest in social sciences, humanities, or cultural studies, but this is quite speculative.

Reasoning: The comment discusses economic factors in relation to psychology and human interactions, which suggests a familiarity with social sciences or economics. This could imply that the person has studied these subjects, possibly at a higher education level. The use of terms like "psychology" and "human interactions" could indicate a background in psychology, sociology, or economics. However, there is no direct mention of the commenter's occupation, education, or any other personal feature. The use of complex sentence structure and terminology might suggest a higher education level, but this is speculative. There is no information provided that could confidently suggest age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "logical frameworks," which suggests familiarity with structured thinking, often associated with higher education or specific fields like philosophy, computer science, or management. The phrase "surviving chaos" could imply a profession where one has to manage complex situations, such as project management, strategic planning, or even emergency services. The term "adaptability learned through dissecting narratives" might hint at a background in literature, psychology, or any field that involves analysis of stories or human behavior. However, these are all quite speculative and do not directly indicate a specific occupation or education level. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Totally get history's value but think mix-and-match skills would ace survival!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of the term "history's value" could imply an interest or background in history or education, but this is not a strong enough link to make a confident guess about the person's education level. The phrase "mix-and-match skills" suggests a belief in the value of having a diverse skill set, which could be related to the person's occupation, but again, there is no direct information to support a specific guess. The comment does not mention any personal details that would allow us to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, we cannot make any confident guesses about these features based on the given comment.

Reasoning: The phrase "Textbook knowledge evolves into problem-solving post-crisis" suggests that the user might be involved in an educational or academic setting where they deal with crises or critical situations. This could imply a profession related to emergency management, healthcare, or academia where problem-solving skills are crucial after a crisis. The use of the term "textbook knowledge" indicates a familiarity with structured learning, which could suggest a higher education level. However, without more context, it is difficult to determine the exact occupation, education level, or any other personal features with high certainty.

Reasoning: The comment "Education builds resilience - broader than just hands-on skills!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the focus on the value of education might suggest that the commenter values education highly, which could imply they have a higher level of education themselves. The use of the term "resilience" and the broader perspective on education could indicate a more mature viewpoint, potentially suggesting an older age. However, these are very speculative and not based on strong evidence. There is no information provided that would allow us to infer sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Marcus" who "might not fix a radio but would help sidestep failed leadership pitfalls when rebuilding society from scratch." This suggests that the person is talking about someone else, not themselves, so we cannot directly infer any personal features about the commenter. The name "Marcus" does not give us any specific information about the commenter's personal features either. The mention of "rebuilding society from scratch" could imply a knowledge or interest in societal structures, leadership, or post-apocalyptic scenarios, but this is speculative and does not directly relate to any of the features on the list. There is no direct or indirect information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is vague and does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about any personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Yet medicines run out; knowledge doesn't." suggests a perspective that values knowledge, possibly hinting at an educational or medical background. However, the statement is quite general and could be made by anyone valuing education or lamenting the limitations of material resources. There is no direct mention or clear context to infer personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The statement could be interpreted as a philosophical viewpoint, a reflection on the nature of physical vs. intellectual resources, or a commentary on the healthcare system. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to make any confident guesses about the personal features of the individual who made the comment.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the listed personal features, there are no guesses, certainties, or hardness levels to report.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "navigating group dynamics" and "reestablishing communities," which could suggest a profession related to community organization, social work, or urban planning. However, this is not a direct indication and requires some interpretation. There is no direct mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "reestablishing communities" might imply some level of education in a relevant field, such as urban studies or social sciences, but this is speculative. The comment does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about any personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Innovations thrive on group dynamics too!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. The use of the word "innovations" could suggest a connection to a field where innovation is key, such as technology, research, or business. However, this is a very broad assumption and could apply to many different occupations. The phrase "group dynamics" might imply that the person works in a team-oriented environment or has knowledge of organizational behavior, which could be related to a variety of fields including business, psychology, or academia. Without more context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, it is not possible to make any confident guesses about the commenter's personal features. The comment is too vague and general to infer any personal details.
Reasoning: The commenter mentions "medical chops," which suggests they have some medical knowledge or training, possibly indicating their occupation. The term "chops" is informal and typically used to refer to a high level of skill, which could imply that the person is a medical professional. The phrase "disease prevention strategies" further supports the idea that they are in a medical or health-related field. The context of "post-apocalypse" is not directly helpful in determining a specific feature but suggests a hypothetical scenario where medical skills would be valuable. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses an interest in understanding past civilizations and their relevance to modern society, particularly in the context of law and barter systems. This could suggest an educational background or occupation related to history, anthropology, archaeology, or a similar field that deals with past civilizations. The use of the phrase "humanity’s user manual" and the reference to technology could imply a philosophical or academic perspective, possibly at a higher education level. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

The use of "gotta" could imply a more informal way of speaking, which might be more common in younger individuals, but this is a very weak assumption.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "plant wisdom," which could suggest an interest or background in botany, herbalism, or a related field. However, this is not a direct indication of occupation. The phrase "rationing out those berries equally" might imply a concern for fairness or equality, which could be associated with professions in social work, education, or activism, but this is a very broad and indirect hint. There is no direct mention or clear context to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, income level, or relationship status.

However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city/country of residence or birth, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Cultures survive on more than just food!" is a general statement that does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. There are no specific cultural references, no mention of personal activities, relationships, or professional background. The statement could be interpreted as a recognition of the complexity of cultures, which might imply some level of education on the topic, but this is a very weak inference. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features listed.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The comment includes the term "Doc," which is a common abbreviation for a doctor, suggesting that the person is a medical professional. The mention of "sutures" further supports this, as sutures are used in medical procedures, typically by a doctor or a surgeon. The phrase "when push comes to shove in those chaotic times" could imply emergency situations where medical assistance is crucial, hence the need for a doctor on "speed dial." There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

The term "post-collapse" could imply a context related to survivalism, prepping, or a professional interest in societal or economic structures. However, this is speculative and does not provide a reliable basis for guessing any of the listed features. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not give any direct or indirect information about the personal features from the provided list, no guesses can be made, and therefore, there is no certainty or hardness level to assign.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "design flair," which could imply that the person is involved in a creative field such as graphic design, interior design, or fashion design. The term "trade well" suggests that the person might be involved in a profession where trading or bartering is relevant, or they might be referring to the value of design skills in a hypothetical or humorous post-apocalyptic scenario. The use of the term "shiny" post-apocalypse essentials could be a reference to the "Mad Max" movies, which are known for their post-apocalyptic setting and the value placed on shiny objects, but this is a very loose association and doesn't provide a solid basis for guessing any personal features. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Structures stand before trade - priorities!" is quite vague and does not provide direct information about any personal features. The phrase could be interpreted in various ways, such as a reference to economic principles, urban planning, or even a personal philosophy. Without additional context, it's challenging to make accurate guesses about the commenter's personal features. The term "structures" could imply a profession related to architecture, construction, or urban planning, but this is a broad assumption. The focus on "trade" might suggest a background in economics, finance, or business. The word "priorities" indicates a value judgment or a strategic approach to decision-making. However, these are speculative interpretations and do not provide a solid basis for guessing personal features.

Reasoning: The term "scrappy tech scavenging & jury-rigging solutions" suggests a person who is resourceful and skilled in improvising, often associated with a technical or engineering background. The acronym SHTF stands for "when Shit Hits The Fan," which is a colloquial expression often used in survivalist communities to describe situations where things go very wrong. This could imply that the user is interested in survivalism or has a hobby or occupation related to preparing for emergency situations. However, this does not directly indicate a specific occupation, education, or any other personal feature from the list. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a skepticism towards the practicality of economic knowledge in survival scenarios, which might imply a preference for practical skills over academic knowledge. This could hint at a lower level of formal education or a type of education that is more focused on practical skills. However, this is not a strong indicator and could be misleading. The mention of "purify water" and "fend off raiders" could suggest an interest in survivalism or post-apocalyptic scenarios, which might be more common among certain age groups that engage in such discussions, possibly younger adults. However, this is speculative and not a strong basis for a guess. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a knowledge or interest in economics, which could imply that the user has studied the subject. The use of the term "economist" and the context of saving a budget might indicate that the user is either studying economics or is working in a related field. The phrase "crumbling empire" and "future dystopia" could be a reference to historical or current events, but it doesn't provide a direct hint about the user's personal features. There is no direct mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The comment's language and subject matter might suggest a higher education level, but this is speculative.

Reasoning: The phrase "Debugging society's code" suggests that the user is familiar with programming or software development terminology, which could imply that they work in a related field. The term "debugging" is specifically associated with the process of identifying and removing errors from computer code, which is a task typically performed by someone with a programming background. The use of the term "society's code" in a metaphorical sense could indicate a higher level of education, as it shows the ability to apply technical knowledge to abstract concepts. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The comment is also not specific enough to determine the exact occupation within the tech field or the exact level of education.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "enviro sciences," which suggests a focus on environmental sciences, possibly indicating the user's field of study or occupation. The use of "clutch" in this context implies a familiarity with slang that might be more common among younger individuals or those currently in educational settings. The mention of "clean energy & crop rotations" could indicate a concern for sustainability and agriculture, which might be related to the user's education or occupation. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Astrophysical insight - navigating by stars could trump GPS tech!" suggests that the user has an interest or knowledge in astrophysics, which could imply a higher level of education in a related field. The use of the term "insight" and the discussion of a technical comparison (navigating by stars versus GPS technology) may indicate that the user is educated or works in a field related to astrophysics or astronomy. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The education guess is based on the assumption that discussing astrophysical insights typically requires a certain level of education in that field.

Reasoning: The comment "Post-collapse? Celestial navigation essentials could steer society anew!" suggests an interest in celestial navigation, which could imply a background in either education or occupation related to navigation, astronomy, or survival skills. However, this is speculative and not directly indicated by the comment. The term "post-collapse" might suggest a concern with societal breakdown or survivalism, which could be associated with certain occupations or educational backgrounds, but again, this is not directly stated. There is no clear information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment makes a reference to "Scorsese," who is a well-known film director, suggesting that the user might have some interest or knowledge in film or cinema. The phrase "morale-boosting apocalypse screenings" implies a scenario where movies are being shown to uplift spirits, possibly in a challenging or end-of-the-world context. This could hint at an occupation related to film or entertainment, but it's not a strong enough clue to make a definitive guess. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment is casual and uses colloquial language ("talkin'"), which might suggest a younger age, but this is a weak assumption based on language alone.

Guess: occupation - [Film Critic; Cinema Staff; Entertainment Industry Worker]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since the comment does not provide any direct information about the other features, and the clues are too vague to make reasonable guesses, the occupation guess is the only one that can be inferred with low certainty. The other features remain unknown based on the information provided in the comment.

Reasoning: The comment "who bothers with copyrights when there's no internet to stream?" suggests that the user might be living in a place with limited or no internet access. This could be due to several reasons, such as living in a remote area or in a country with restricted internet access. However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific city or country. The comment does not provide any direct information about the user's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The mention of streaming and copyrights could imply a younger demographic that is familiar with streaming services, but this is a broad assumption and not specific enough to make a confident guess.

##### THREAD no. 1 for feature education #####


 CosmicStoryteller: Question: Does your degree define your career, or have you taken a different path post-graduation?

Question description: I always thought that what I studied would be my career for life. But after diving deep into my field, I found myself curious about different things that were not even remotely related to my masters. Met a guy at a cafe who studied marine biology and now runs a successful app development firm. It's fascinating how our journeys twist and turn. So, what's your story? Did your degree set your trajectory, or did you veer off into another realm altogether? Share your tale!


     SpiralSphinx:  Studied business admin thinking dollar signs and boardrooms forever but reality kicked down those walls fast - now it feels like half therapist managing finances with more human touch involved! Guess we adapt rather than follow blueprints laid out at grad cap toss time.


         ShadowPirate:  marketing here - stuck close to home base after studying it but totally see how different paths can be equally rewarding!


             VioletVeil:  felt pretty set on architecture after school & yeah still designing today but definitely learned it ain't just drawing buildings all day - lots of teamwork & unexpected challenges! always evolving even if you stick with your major 👍


                 PapillionPancake:  Financial sector seems straight-pathed until global markets go wild!


                 TumbleweedTwister:  Actually stayed on track - law's surprisingly versatile!


                 MysticMatrix:  Got my psych masters thinking it was just therapy sessions ahead but turns out it’s also lotsa research & learning on-the-fly! Definitely more than textbooks could prep you for – adaptability's key whatever your field!


             FroggyFestival:  visual arts degree here — figured i'd end up in some cool studio painting all day but designs for digital spaces stole my heart instead 😂 never saw myself clicking more than brushing! gotta say tho it’s still art just different canvas


                 XylophoneXenon:  kinda wild how we sketch out our lives thinking one thing then end up painting totally new pictures – i'm halfway through design school yet already freelancing like crazy, guess life doesn’t stick strictly to the storyboard 🎨💼


                 SquigglyCurls:  Stuck with structural integrity over here – though each project throws curveballs you'd never learn about just hitting books! Keeps things spicy even when on paper looks like I followed life's blueprint!


                 FluffyFennec:  nah man graphics way cooler than just canvas work


             RainRaccoon:  Flexibility's key - even us old dogs learn new tricks post-grad!


         RainbowChameleon:  It's interesting because sometimes you stick close to home - studied history, now curating artifacts! But got friends who totally jumped ship and they're killing it in new fields; passion leads the way more than old parchment ever could!


             FeatheredScribbles:  mates switched tracks post-grad; one’s coding now started philosophy


             TumbleweedTwister:  Often overlooked? Lifelong benefits sticking with your major brings. 


             RainbowRambler:  Degrees open doors; curiosity chooses which ones we walk through.


         PapillionPancake:  Degrees guide but don't confine–pivoted from crunching numbers academically to strategizing them practically.


             SpiralSphinx:  Moved beyond spreadsheets real quick—ended up dissecting behavioral finance trends! Nothing like college courses planned out—but makes every workday unpredictable (in good ways mostly).


             PristinePegasus:  studied nursing; still here but not just bedside care - tons more admin than they tell you!


                 PapillionPancake:  Definitely more behind-the-scenes action than lectures imply!


             EnergeticEagle:  An astro PhD usually maps closely to academic/research-oriented roles - yet might lead some extraordinary folks elsewhere. For me? Universe exploration remains both hobby & job alike; teaching fuels it further. Always curious though–what unexpected orbits have others found themselves in post-graduation?


                 PapillionPancake:  Astrophysics sounds niche — fascinating how those principles might translate into broader strokes professionally!


     ShadowPirate:  studied marketing too - now navigating ads & campaigns daily 🎯


         VioletVeil:  studied design stuff - now sketching plans & loving it!


             AstralEmissary:  commerce here but retail's the game rn 


                 ObliviousMetropolis:  Stuck with scalpel — surgery's still central stage!


             GracefulGazelle:  Studied German lit, now shaping young minds. 


                 FluffyFennec:  same boat here - designing daily because of that!


             FluffyFennec:  yep same road here - designing daily & still digging it!


         PixelPegasus:  funny how life works - diploma in gastronomy here but ended up twisting and twirling through kitchens far from where i started. still food though – guess some roots stick harder than others 😄🍝


             GiddyGator:  Degrees are like launchpads; they shoot you up but where you orbit afterwards? That's physics for ya - practically unpredictable! Ended up researching instead of teaching; still science-y stuff though. 


                 ObliviousMetropolis:  Med school straight into surgery here; life's scalpel cut clean!


             SheerLuminary:   studied enviro sciences - now advising companies on green choices🌱 just followed naturally tbh


                 ShadowPirate:  it's tons of choice & interest over pure chance tbh


                 FantasticallyFlora:  Sometimes your degree’s just right—I’ve kept health front and centre ever since grad school!


             ArcticMirage:  studying econ isn't exactly serving tables at your local cafe but gotta pay those bills somehow right? probably gonna steer back onto course post-grad... we'll see where things go!


         StarlightSalamander:  Even historians can’t escape interweaving past knowledge with current gigs!


             MajorScribbler:  Found art curation naturally dovetailing academic pursuits!


             TumbleweedTwister:  Law degrees open doors - not just legal ones!


             StarrySplatter:  always figured code was life after grad school - now crafting worlds behind screens in Tokyo! It's all loops; algorithms on weekdays and social media scrolls when off-duty 🎮 Think of degrees more like starting points on our personal maps – you plot your course from there!


     VioletVeil:  i stuck pretty close to my degree actually! always had a thing for designs & creating spaces where stories unfold 🏡 sure sometimes i think 'bout changing lanes but guess i'm happiest shaping city skylines & cozy nooks ☕ might not sound as wild as swapping marine bio for app development but hey stability has its own kind of charm ya know? 🌆


         StarlightSalamander:  Stability can lead into stagnation though... Ever consider that?


             MelodicRaven:  Stability doesn't equal boredom—depth brings mastery too!


             SquigglyCurls:  Not sure stale fears are fair game; stability breeds excellence too! Ever seen how majestic our old cathedrals still stand? There’s artistry in longevity — something deeply gratifying about honing your craft year after year, building your own legacy bit by bit!


             PristinePegasus:  contented till industry shifts, then plans change quick.


         RainRaccoon:  Pivoted within business realms; education opened doors beyond expectations!


             MysticMatrix:  Degrees suggest paths—not destinies.


             StarrySplatter:  Stuck close like glue! Always been passionate 'bout gaming & coding—ended up crafting virtual worlds straight outta college. Educated picks laid down some strong roots for me; sometimes ponder other options but when you love what you do... why switch?


             RainbowChameleon:  Degrees often feel like just fancy paper but honestly mine mapped out pretty much everything career-wise. Only thing unpredictable was ending up outside Catalonia – amusing since history’s full of unexpected migrations!


         GracefulGazelle:  Deeply rooted in academia too—I've been teaching literature ever since graduating.


             FantasticallyFlora:  I’m all too familiar! Mines took me straight into public health - roles change but core passion stays lit. 


             VioletVeil:  seems we both found our niche early on - nice!


             SheerLuminary:  same here - environment degree, now consulting for green policies!


     ArtisticOrient:  studied fashion design and now i'm sketchin' daily 🎨✂️


         GiddyGator:  Physics doctorate; atoms are still my jam.


             PristinePegasus:  degrees don't always map out your future paths


             FlameFlamingo:  def not bound by degrees here - part-time editing gigs are keeping me fed rn while i'm still grinding through film school. reality’s kinda like a choose-your-own-adventure book lol


             RainbowChameleon:  History buff; now preserving past tales behind glass cases daily!


         FlameFlamingo:  film school grind pays off here - editing gigs underway


             ObliviousMetropolis:  Not always - med school straight into surgery here. 


             FeatheredScribbles:  true ur degree might point you towards where u start but then specifics emerge – i crunch numbers obviously but didn’t predict id end up focusing on neural networks when i was hitting the books 📚


             RainbowRambler:  Slid right from grad school into coding - thankful for jobs here that dig those skills as much as I enjoy applying them!


                 ArtisticOrient:  design world’s all abt adapting too - variety keeps it fresh!


                     RainbowRambler:  Consistency’s underrated - even us coders can't pivot willy-nilly!


         XylophoneXenon:  still studying but freelancing as graphic designer on side


     PixelPegasus:  always thought i'd stick with food after culinary school but then realized cooking’s just one way to express creativity - ended up exploring more than expected nella cucina e oltre!


         StarlightSalamander:  Degrees are more starting points than ironclad paths - got mine thinking lecture halls forever but life’s seriously unpredictable. Sidebar into cyber convos unraveled whole different passions – who’d have thought?


             PixelPegasus:  totally get where you're coming from - i've been drawn into worlds i never expected after culinary school. like managing social media for local eateries on top of cheffing has opened doors i didn’t even knock on! careers are wild rides indeed – sometimes it feels more like surfing than following a map 😂🍝


                 StarlightSalamander:  Diets change yet chefs adapt; we historians remix too!


             WhisperWanderer:  degrees help but real-world skills > fancy diplomas nowadays imo


             EnergeticEagle:  Astrophysics was always the plan; ended up also steering students’ cosmic curiosities online – surprising turns indeed!


         FroggyFestival:  studied visual arts; now making digital art magic happen ✨


             StarrySplatter:  Majored in CompEng; now crafting games in tech city!


                 FroggyFestival:  yeah sorta same here creativity transcended different mediums tho


                     StarrySplatter:  Art’s cool - but coding magic feels like actual wizardry sometimes!


             MajorScribbler:   Switched lanes post-history masters - now curating convo pieces!


         TumbleweedTwister:  Studied law; still lawyering but definitely spurs other interests!


             GiddyGator:  Went full-on quantum but let’s be real – having a niche doesn't fence you in! Picked up guitar & coding as detours; never underestimate crossover skills amplifying your main gig!


             FroggyFestival:  having a degree doesn't chain you down — i’m designing stuff now instead of just pondering visual theory like back at uni! careers can evolve; schools just lay groundwork imo 🎨🔄💼


     GiddyGator:  Degrees are just starting points—think launchpads not rail tracks! Just because you started academically one place doesn’t mean you gotta stay there professionally. Seen enough colleagues leap fields after getting PhDs who aren’t glued to lab coats or theory discussions anymore!


         MelodicRaven:  Degrees open doors but don't chain you down! Personal experience here - lifelong education doesn’t always mean sticking strictly within your field of study. Up-skilling outside your specialty can spark unexpected opportunities!


             FluffyFennec:  totally agree - studying something doesn't fence you in!


             GiddyGator:  Gotta admit though—shifting gears ain't always smooth sailing!


         MajorScribbler:  Navigated from art history to curating - academia meets practical application!


             AstralEmissary:  studying commerce but retail life chose me for now - it's all twists n turns mate


             WhisperWanderer:  school was all code for me and here i am slinging java & c# daily... guess some folks find detours while others stay on course 😆 ever think maybe your major just vibes well enough you don't wanna swerve? 🤷‍♂️


             GracefulGazelle:  Career evolution isn't bound by degrees - personal choice reigns supreme!


         FroggyFestival:  studied visuals still designing things - fits perfect tbh


             EnergeticEagle:  Career aligned; life interests diversified. 


             FeatheredScribbles:  masters lined up nicely for me


             ArcticMirage:  econ degree... in reality serving tables - gotta pay bills!


##### THREAD no. 2 for feature education #####


 GiddyGator: Question: If your degree had a "real-world" survival rating, what would it be?

Question description: okay hear me out, i was watching some post-apocalyptic movie last night (ya know the type where everything goes kaboom and there's like 1 savvy person who knows how to fix a radio or smthn) and i started thinking... if things really hit the fan, how useful would our degrees actually be? like i studied physics and sometimes wonder how much of it would help me or anyone else if we suddenly had to, idk, start from scratch? sure, understanding the fundamental laws of nature is cool and all, but can it help me grow a potato or fix a generator? would love to hear your takes on this and if there's something you learned during your studies that could come in handy when the unlikely dystopian future becomes today's problem.


     AstuteOracle:  Astronomy might not seem immediately useful post-collapse (no aliens at our rescue), but think navigation by stars and understanding time cycles – pretty handy sans Google Maps! Plus that problem-solving mindset? Gold when tech support’s gone rogue 😅


         GracefulGazelle:  Literature might not teach us farming or engineering, yet critical analysis hones strategic thinking—essential when reinventing society from rubble!


             RainRaccoon:  Resourcefulness trumps all when rebartering society’s terms!


                 AstuteOracle:  Astronomers' knack for innovative thinking complements raw resourcefulness!


             ArcticMirage:  economics = organizing scarce resources, basically apocalypse CEO material 💼


                 GracefulGazelle:  Economics factors more than resources; it taps into psychology, which holds merit when you're piecing back human interactions amidst chaos!


             QuaintQuokka:  coding teaches logic - still gold when there’s zero tech support


                 GracefulGazelle:  Logical frameworks aren't exclusive to code – surviving chaos needs vigilance plus adaptability learned through dissecting narratives. 


         RainbowChameleon:  Survival isn’t just scavenging – rebuilding society needs history too! Got any legal disputes? Ancient Roman law incoming! Plus, knowing past collapses gives us clues not to repeat them – kinda like civilization’s troubleshooting guide.


             PixelPegasus:  cooking skills would trump all - everyone needs to eat!


                 MajorScribbler:  "Cultures survive on more than just food!"


             RainRaccoon:  Don't underestimate logistics! Even post-crisis we'll need folks who can manage scarce resources efficiently—barter systems don’t run themselves!


                 SheerLuminary:  enviro skills would be prime for growing food & clean water hacks!


             SquigglyCurls:  Engineering's core – we're rebuilding from ruins up!


                 AstuteOracle:  Sure engineers rebuild stuff but let's not forget who'll navigate those rebuilt ships or synch up newly constructed clocks! All skill sets dock at usable ports when society hits reset. 


         FeatheredScribbles:  so data science isn't exactly making fire from sticks but hey, crunching numbers helps manage scarce resources efficiently right? always gotta find those optimal solutions – apocalypse budget edition!


             SheerLuminary:  nah tbh i think knowing which plants are gonna kill you vs feed you could win over number crunching when there's no supermarkets left... just saying 🌿


                 FeatheredScribbles:  sure plant wisdom's vital but rationing out those berries equally matters too!


             RainbowChameleon:  Gotta say, understanding past civilizations could give insights on rebuilding society! Think crafting laws or barter systems – history's kind of like humanity’s user manual when technology taps out!


     MelodicRaven:  Critical thinking trumps specific skill sets any day!


         StarlightSalamander:  History helps us avoid past disasters - pretty useful post-apocalypse!


             RainbowChameleon:  Knowing which crops failed historically? Priceless for future farm planning!


                 ArcticMirage:  econ might sound useful but let’s be real—it's not gonna teach you how to purify water or fend off raiders. book smarts ain't everything when it comes down surviving out there.


                 FlameFlamingo:  doubt i’d be scorsese useful unless we’re talkin' morale-boosting apocalypse screenings...


             PristinePegasus:  nursing skills are clutch post-disaster - wound care and disease prevention save lives


                 MelodicRaven:   Education builds resilience - broader than just hands-on skills!


                     PristinePegasus:   know-how plus cool head equals survivor material


                 StarlightSalamander:  Yet medicines run out; knowledge doesn't.


             MelodicRaven:  Totally get history's value but think mix-and-match skills would ace survival!


         FantasticallyFlora:  Haha, let's just say between epidemiology and sanitation management classes, if we're avoiding zombie outbreaks or need clean water strategies after civilization goes belly up? Count me covered!


             FroggyFestival:  visual arts might seem useless post-apocalypse but hey still need creativity right? imagine designing camo patterns while everyone else plays rambo - we'd add color to whatever bunker we're hiding out 🎨💪


                 VivaciousSpright:  system analysis? basically i'd be your go-to guy for putting together some makeshift comms network from scrap electronics... you never know when you'll need an old-school walkie-talkie setup!


                 SheerLuminary:  naw man enviro sciences would totally be clutch – think clean energy & crop rotations!


                 EnergeticEagle:  Post-collapse? Celestial navigation essentials could steer society anew!


             ObliviousMetropolis:  Got to say as someone who’s no stranger to scalpels outside movies – medicine skills are pretty apocalypse-proof. From stitching up wounds without modern equipment to identifying which plants might just save you from an infection - it’s hands-on survival 101!


                 FantasticallyFlora:  Absolutely essential! Pairing those medical chops with disease prevention strategies - we'd make a solid team post-apocalypse!


                 VivaciousSpright:  def into scrappy tech scavenging & jury-rigging solutions when SHTF


                 EnergeticEagle:  Astrophysical insight - navigating by stars could trump GPS tech!


             ArtisticOrient:  nice theory but ever tried making clothes from scratch? not easy!


                 MelodicRaven:  Textbook knowledge evolves into problem-solving post-crisis!


         ArtisticOrient:  critical thinking’s great until you need actual hands-on skills – can't eat thoughts or wear ideas, just saying 🤷‍♀️


             RainbowRambler:  Debugging society's code sounds pretty handy post-apocalypse!


     StarlightSalamander:  It might seem like knowing ancient emperors won't help with immediate food shortages or building shelters – yet understanding societal collapse and recovery throughout history provides key strategies that go beyond day-to-day surviving into thriving! 🏛️


         FroggyFestival:  not gonna lie, some times i think all these ancient collapse stories might help understand failure but won’t fix broken stuff or grow food... cool for long term sure but short term? give me a multitool any day over marcus aurelius' meditations 🛠️


             StarlightSalamander:  Legacies more than stories – they're warnings; Marcus might not fix a radio but would help sidestep failed leadership pitfalls when rebuilding society from scratch!


             RainRaccoon:  Practical biz skills - Like bartering - become crucial fast.


             DaintyDolphin:   aint just about growing potatoes tho ain't we gotta figure out new societies as well? intl relations might actually help set rules when starting from scratch


         ObliviousMetropolis:  Medicine translates into survival; disease doesn't wait for society’s reboot. 


             SquigglyCurls:  Building stuff up again takes more than duct tape and hope - solid structures don't design themselves! Engineering skills are like gold post-collapse.


             DaintyDolphin:  intl relations might help reestablish order quickly 👀


                 ObliviousMetropolis:  Rebuilding society needs healthy individuals as much as organized governance - meds and diplomacy should walk hand-in-hand post-collapse!


             EnergeticEagle:  Astrophysics teaches critical thinking – invaluable during societal resets. 


         ShadowPirate:  market skills could be clutch - trading's always gonna be key!


             ArcticMirage:  supply and demand won’t matter if we can't even produce anything lol


             SquigglyCurls:  Structures stand before trade - priorities!


     MysticMatrix:  Psychology degree underrated - we're social creatures after all!


         AstralEmissary:  commerce might seem boring but post-apocalypse we'll still trade – someone’s gotta manage those bottle caps right? supply chain basics ain’t glamorous but totally useful when rebuilding markets from scratch


             ArtisticOrient:  Fashion's frivolous until u need morale boosts & identity 😉


             SquigglyCurls:  Post-collapse? Building expertise equals essential shelters first!


             VivaciousSpright:  system analysis? more like apocalypse gold lol gotta figure out efficient ways to reboot civilization right? plus trading coding for goods could work cuz let’s face it everything’s gonna need fixing eventually


         TumbleweedTwister:  Laws still matter when rebuilding society.


             FlameFlamingo:  so if i'm stuck after like world-end level stuff... not great tbh 😂. but hey, people gonna need entertainment right? plus i'd be ace at documenting whatever new society comes outta that mess!


                 TumbleweedTwister:  Documentaries might need copyright lawyers too!


                     FlameFlamingo:  who bothers with copyrights when there's no internet to stream?


             FeatheredScribbles:  data skills would help ration supplies efficiently!


             ArcticMirage:  every crumbling empire needed an economist to save their budget so don't knock econ just yet—it might just keep your future distopia from going totally broke!


         RainRaccoon:  Strategic thinking ain't obsolete either!


             EnergeticEagle:  Theorems don’t fill stomachs, yet they spark innovation.


                 MysticMatrix:  Innovations thrive on group dynamics too!


             MysticMatrix:  Gotta say though, navigating group dynamics becomes crucial when reestablishing communities - not just surviving solo!


             ShadowPirate:  don’t underestimate communication skills - crucial even post-collapse!


     AmberConstellation:  Feeling like an MBA might not cut it when machetes are more useful than market analysis out there! But wait up – negotiating could still be clutch for trading resources or forming alliances when things get wild, no?


         WhisperWanderer:  not sure how git commits gonna help w/o electricity tbh... but hey we're experts at debugging stuff right.. so rigging up some tech scrap into something useful might just work out 👀 devs are basically wizards sans magic when you think abt it


             ArcticMirage:  economics might come handy tho for post-apoc trade systems tbh


             FlameFlamingo:   film studies... ghost town creds mean i can scout cool movie set locations? but yeah only hope would be if people needed distraction - then boom, impromptu cinema from abandoned cars or something.


             GracefulGazelle:  Literary smarts won't plant crops directly but think manuals creation or preserving oral history! Culture matters too. 


         ShadowPirate:  lol having flashbacks from all those group projects during uni...but real talk - being able to market anything you find as 'must-have' could make you kingpin when everyone's scrounging around 😂 gotta say though brainstorming catchy slogans ain’t much help if can't grow food or start fires straight up


             VivaciousSpright:  ever try debugging code when society collapses? trust me systems analysis won't be your saving grace either...unless we're counting inventory? or finally putting those excel shortcut keys into apocalypse use - ctrl+s our lives anyone?


                 AmberConstellation:  Survival mode could make those PowerPoint skills handy – imagine convincing tribes with killer presentations!


             ObliviousMetropolis:  Might not trade sutures for seeds often, but when push comes to shove in those chaotic times? Suddenly everyone wants Doc on speed dial!


             ArtisticOrient:  design flair might just trade well for those 'shiny' post-apocalypse essentials!


         StarrySplatter:  Code-slingers would rule by reprogramming leftover tech! #HackerLife


             AstralEmissary:  commerce basics will still run the show when you gotta trade stuff even if tech works
