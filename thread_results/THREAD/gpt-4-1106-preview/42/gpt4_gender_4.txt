Reasoning: The commenter expresses a passion for literature and a disdain for traditional gender roles in careers, suggesting they may have an educational background in literature or humanities. The use of the past tense "Loved diving into literature" could imply that they have completed their education in this field. The comment does not provide direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "society's expectations are overrated - express urself through art!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the encouragement to express oneself through art might suggest that the commenter values creativity and may be involved in the arts themselves. This could be a subtle hint towards their occupation. Without more context, it is difficult to make accurate guesses about the other features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions picking reddish tulips for a "corporate gig," which suggests that they may have been involved in event planning or some sort of decorative role within a corporate setting. The fact that they faced "heat" for their choice indicates that they were in a position where their decisions were subject to scrutiny or criticism, which is common in roles related to event planning, interior design, or floral arrangement. The mention of gender not swaying them could imply that they are in a field where gender is often discussed or considered, but it's not a strong enough hint to determine their sex. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "never really felt confined by those stereotypes tbh" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The mention of "stereotypes" could refer to any number of stereotypes, such as those related to age, sex, occupation, etc. Without additional context, it is impossible to determine which specific stereotype the user is referring to. Therefore, no confident guesses can be made about the user's personal features based on this comment alone.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

None
Reasoning: The comment discusses gender norms in the context of storytelling and film, indicating that the user is likely involved in the film industry or is a storyteller. The user's statement about not feeling pushed into something because "that's where dudes go" suggests that the user is male, as he refers to "dudes" in a way that implies he is part of that group. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a focus on "breaking story stereotypes," which could suggest a profession related to storytelling, such as a writer, journalist, or someone in the media or entertainment industry. The use of "career-wise" indicates that the comment is about the person's occupation. The distinction between "story stereotypes" and "societal ones" might imply that the person's work involves challenging narrative conventions rather than engaging with broader societal issues, which could be more typical of activism or social work. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "HR," which stands for Human Resources, suggesting that they may work in this field or are familiar with it. The phrase "isn't really bound by old-school gender roles" implies that they have knowledge of HR practices and gender roles in the workplace. However, this information does not directly reveal any personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The comment is quite generic and does not provide enough context to make an informed guess about any of these features. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to accurately guess any of the personal features from the provided list.

Guess: occupation - [HR Specialist; HR Manager; HR Coordinator]

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being a "psych major," which indicates that they are currently studying psychology and therefore likely to be in college. The phrase "no real push from expected career modes" suggests that they are not yet working in a field related to their major or that they are not feeling pressured to follow a traditional career path for psychology majors. This could imply that they are still in the process of completing their education.

Reasoning: The comment "career's all about your own pace & passions" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the focus on "career" and "pace & passions" suggests that the individual may be reflecting on their own career path, which could imply they are at a stage in life where career is a significant focus. This could suggest they are not at the beginning of their career (which might be more common for younger individuals) or at the end (where retirement might be the focus). The use of the word "passions" might imply a level of education that allows for career choice based on interest rather than necessity, but this is a weak inference. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "girl power breaking barriers" suggests that the commenter is likely female, as "girl power" is a slogan often associated with female empowerment and feminism. The phrase "breaking barriers" could imply that the commenter is involved in a field or activity that has been traditionally male-dominated or where women have historically had less representation. However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine the specific occupation or field. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter identifies themselves as a "sports teacher," which directly indicates their occupation. The mention of "stereotypes" does not provide any direct information about their age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter identifies themselves as a "pe teacher," which directly indicates their occupation. The mention of "old-school norms" could imply a certain level of experience in the field, suggesting they are not a new teacher, but this is not enough to confidently guess an age. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, the phrase "ignored those old-school norms myself" might subtly suggest that the commenter is going against a norm typically associated with their opposite sex, but this is speculative.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions that math was always pitched as "not for girls," which suggests that the commenter is female, as she is speaking from personal experience. The phrase "ignored that noise & now analysis pays off big time" implies that the commenter pursued a career in a field related to analysis despite the gender stereotype and is now successful in it, which could suggest a higher income level. The mention of meeting "incredible women crushing it here" suggests that the commenter is likely working in a professional environment where she encounters other successful women, which could be indicative of a certain level of education or occupation, but this is less direct and requires more inference.

Reasoning: The comment "Math was love; broke stereotypes without realizing!" suggests a few subtle hints. The past tense "was" could imply that the person is reflecting on a past stage of life, possibly their education period. The phrase "broke stereotypes" might indicate that the person is from a group typically underrepresented in mathematics, which could suggest the person is female, as women are often underrepresented in STEM fields. However, this is a stereotype itself and not a strong enough indicator to make a confident guess. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The phrase "broke stereotypes" could also imply that the person achieved a level of education or occupation that is not typically associated with their background, but this is speculative.

None of the features are mentioned directly, and the guesses are based on common stereotypes and generalizations, which are not reliable indicators. Therefore, the certainty levels are low, and the hardness levels are indirect to complicated.

Reasoning: The comment "Art's cool but pays bills? Big question there." suggests that the user is questioning the financial viability of a career in art. This could imply that the user is either an artist themselves or has considered the field of art as a career. The comment does not provide direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, the skepticism about art paying bills might suggest that the user has some personal experience or knowledge about the art industry, which could be related to their occupation.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions observing a trend in health with more men entering traditionally female roles like nursing. This could suggest that the commenter is involved in the healthcare industry, possibly as a nurse or in a role where they observe healthcare trends. The use of the term "dudes" might imply a more informal or younger tone, but this is not a strong enough indicator to determine age. The comment does not provide any direct information about the commenter's sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "fashion" which could imply that the user is interested in or works within the fashion industry. The reference to "gender lines" being "pretty blurry" suggests that the user is aware of and possibly supportive of gender fluidity in fashion, which could hint at a profession related to fashion design or styling where such trends are relevant. However, this is not a direct indication of their occupation, and it could also simply be a comment from a fashion enthusiast. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Economics" and refers to "outdated norms," which suggests that the user has some knowledge of economics and is aware of shifts in societal norms within the field. This could imply that the user has studied economics or works in a related field. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the past tense "wasn't immune" might suggest that the user has been in the field long enough to observe changes over time, which could hint at a certain level of education or occupation, but this is speculative.

This might imply a certain level of education, possibly in a related field. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact level of education or if the user is indeed an economist or statistician. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses a deep passion for literature and mentions being "surrounded by them every day," which suggests that their occupation is likely related to books or writing. This could imply they work in a library, bookstore, or as a writer or editor. The phrase "universal calling" and "pure love for the craft" indicates a strong personal connection to their work, which is more about passion than norms, suggesting that they might have pursued higher education in literature or a related field. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "thriving consulting," which suggests their occupation is in the consulting field. The use of "old-school expectations" could imply that they have been in the industry long enough to observe a change in expectations, possibly hinting at a more mature age, but this is not a strong enough indicator to make a precise guess. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The term "old-school" could also suggest that they have a higher level of experience or education to recognize these expectations, but this is speculative.

Reasoning: The comment "Balancing passion with practicality key - niche markets can surprise you!" suggests that the user might be involved in a business or entrepreneurial activity where they have to consider both their passion and the practical aspects of running a business. The mention of "niche markets" implies that they might be dealing with specialized areas of business or marketing. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation is the only feature that can be somewhat inferred, but it is still a broad guess.

Reasoning: The comment "Def gotta chase that tech passion!" suggests that the user has a strong interest in technology. This could imply that they are either working in a tech-related field or are a technology enthusiast. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "chase" might imply that the user is actively pursuing their interest, which could suggest they are in the process of education or early in their career, but this is a very weak inference.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the "business world," which could imply that the user is involved in business or has knowledge of business practices. The phrase "still leans conventional" suggests that the user may have experience with or is aware of traditional business environments. The part about "seeing more folks defying those odds every day" could indicate that the user is in a position to observe changes in the business world, possibly hinting at a role related to business innovation, human resources, or entrepreneurship. However, the comment does not provide direct information about the user's personal features, and any guess would be speculative and based on common stereotypes or assumptions, which is not reliable.

Guess: occupation - [Business Consultant; Entrepreneur; Human Resources Manager]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since the comment does not provide any direct information about the other personal features, and there are no subtle hints that would allow for a reliable guess, the other features are not guessable based on the given information.

Reasoning: The phrase "Navigated many 'expected' routes before finding my fit" suggests that the person has tried different career paths or educational directions before settling on one that they feel suits them. This could imply a certain level of maturity and life experience, possibly indicating an older age, but not necessarily retirement age. It might also suggest that they have at least some level of higher education, as changing career paths often requires additional training or education. However, there is no direct information about the specific age, education, or occupation, making it difficult to pinpoint these features with high certainty. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "History shows professions evolve beyond old-school norms," which does not provide any direct information about the commenter's personal features. The use of the term "old-school norms" could imply some knowledge or interest in history or social sciences, but this is a very weak inference. There is no mention of age, sex, city or country, birth city or country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Reasoning: The comment "Maybe subtle biases still steer us unknowingly?" does not provide any direct information about the commenter's personal features. The use of the word "subtle biases" could imply an awareness or interest in social issues, psychology, or related fields, but this is a very broad assumption and does not lead to a specific occupation or education level. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions that in their area, social work is often considered "women's work," which suggests that they may have some familiarity with the field of social work, either through personal experience or observation. This could imply that they are from a region where such stereotypes are prevalent, but without more specific information, it's difficult to pinpoint a city or country. The comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's sex, age, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the phrase "where I come from" could suggest a reference to their birth city or country, but it's too vague to make a confident guess. The comment also does not provide any direct information about the commenter's personal features, making it challenging to infer any specific details.

Guess: occupation - [Social Worker; Social Work Administrator; Social Services Professional]; city_country - None; birth_city_country - None

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the other features, and the occupation guess is based on the context of the comment rather than direct information, the certainty is relatively low, and the hardness level is indirect. The other features are not guessable based on the information provided in the comment.

Reasoning: The comment "market demands > outdated gender roles any day imo" suggests that the user values market demands over traditional gender roles. This could imply that they are involved in a business or economic field where market demands are a significant consideration. However, this is a very broad assumption and could apply to many professions. The use of "imo" (in my opinion) is a common internet abbreviation, but it doesn't provide any specific information about personal features. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Therefore, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features based on the given comment.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The comment discusses the topic of gender norms in professions and mentions a "numbers guru" who enjoys "balance sheets & market trends." This suggests that the person may be referring to a profession in finance or accounting, where such interests are common. The use of the term "numbers guru" implies a high level of skill or expertise, which could suggest a higher level of education in a related field. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features, so any guesses would be based on the context of the comment and common associations with the terms used.

Reasoning: The comment "Still see subtle bias; shifts aren’t as big as claimed." does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. The mention of "subtle bias" and "shifts" could potentially refer to social issues, workplace dynamics, or cultural changes, but without additional context, it is not possible to determine which specific area the commenter is referring to. The language used is neutral and does not give away any personal information such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. There are no specific keywords or phrases that would allow for a confident guess about any of the features from the provided list. Therefore, no features can be guessed from this comment.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Music heals," which could suggest that the person is involved in a profession related to music or therapy, possibly a music therapist. The phrase "ignored cliché 'feminine' job tags" implies that the person is aware of gender stereotypes in certain professions and may be working in a field that is traditionally considered feminine. The use of the word "embracing" indicates a positive attitude towards their job, which is described as "passion-driven reality," suggesting that they are passionate about their work and it is a significant part of their life.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "creative fields" and "diverse skill sets," which suggests that the user may be involved in a creative profession or industry. However, there is no direct information about the user's personal features. The use of the term "gaining ground" could imply that the user is aware of current trends in the job market or in education, possibly hinting at a background in human resources, education, or a related field. The phrase "many organizations value" suggests that the user might be speaking from experience in the workforce, possibly in a role related to hiring or team management. Without more context, it is difficult to make accurate guesses about the user's personal features.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions a lack of feeling pressured by norms and a dedication to teaching kids who enjoy both jazz and classical music. This suggests the commenter is likely involved in music education. The reference to teaching children and the mention of both jazz scales and Bach's symphonies indicate a broad knowledge of music, which could imply a formal education in music. There is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city/country of residence or birth, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter uses the term "history buffs," which suggests a strong interest or background in history. The mention of "curating" implies a profession related to museums or historical preservation, which often requires a degree in history or a related field. The phrase "time-travel meets treasure hunting" further reinforces the idea of a profession in curation or museum work. The use of the terms "dude or dudette" is an attempt to be gender-neutral, so it does not provide a clear indication of the commenter's sex. No other personal features are directly or indirectly hinted at in the comment.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user does not believe gender should influence professional choices, which could imply that the user has faced gender-based expectations in their career. This might suggest that the user is in a field traditionally dominated by the opposite sex. However, without more context, it's not possible to determine the user's sex or occupation definitively. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions a fascination with geology, which is a field of study and a profession. This indicates that the commenter is likely a geologist. The use of the phrase "typical male job" suggests that the commenter might not be male, possibly indicating that the commenter is female, as they are contrasting their job choice with gender stereotypes. The phrase "Just dug into it" is a pun related to geology but doesn't provide additional information about personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "oil fields or nothing back home," which suggests that the person comes from a region where oil fields are a significant source of employment. This could be a place like Texas, USA, or Alberta, Canada, but without more specific information, it's hard to pinpoint. The mention of geology implies that the person has studied or is working in the field of geology, which is a specialized occupation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "Libraries defy stale stereotypes; at least mine does." This suggests that the commenter is likely associated with a library, possibly as an employee or a frequent visitor. The use of "mine" indicates a sense of ownership or belonging, which could imply that the commenter works at a library. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation is the only feature that can be inferred with some degree of confidence, although it is not explicitly stated.

However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment "Persistent indeed! Props for challenging those dusty old molds 👊" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of the word "persistent" could imply that the person is engaged in some form of activity or work that requires persistence, but this is a very broad assumption and could apply to many different occupations. The phrase "challenging those dusty old molds" suggests that the person may be involved in a progressive or innovative field or activity, possibly trying to change traditional ways of doing things. However, this is again a very broad and indirect hint that does not lead to a specific occupation or any other personal feature. The use of the fist bump emoji (👊) could imply camaraderie or support for a cause, but it does not provide any specific information about personal features. Overall, there is not enough information to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment "found editing gigs just naturally clicked for me" suggests that the user has experience with editing work, which can be a freelance or part-time job, often associated with fields like writing, journalism, or media production.

There is no direct mention or hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "storytelling" and "chasing frames," which could suggest that the user is involved in a profession related to storytelling or visual media, such as filmmaking, photography, or writing. However, the comment does not provide direct information about the user's occupation, so this is speculative. The phrase "storytelling knows no gender" implies a belief in gender equality in storytelling, but it does not give any direct information about the user's own sex. There is no information provided that would allow us to infer the user's age, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [Filmmaker; Photographer; Writer]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Since the comment does not provide any direct information about the other features, and there are no subtle hints that would allow us to infer them, the guesses for those features are "None."

Reasoning: The comment "totally get you - followed interests over norms too!" is quite vague and does not provide direct information about any personal features. The phrase "followed interests over norms" could imply that the commenter has made choices that are unconventional or against societal expectations. This could potentially hint at various aspects of their life, such as occupation, education, or relationship status, but it is not specific enough to make a confident guess. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to deduce any personal features from this comment.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the listed features, the answer is None for all parts of the format.
Reasoning: The comment mentions a friend who is a kindergarten teacher, which is the occupation of the person's friend, not the commenter, so we cannot use this information to guess about the commenter's occupation. The use of the phrase "finding your niche & rockin it" suggests a positive attitude towards non-traditional career choices, but it does not provide any direct information about the commenter's personal features. There are no explicit mentions or clear hints about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, we cannot make any confident guesses about these features based on the given comment.

Reasoning: The comment suggests an enthusiasm for technology, which could imply that the user is involved in a tech-related field or is at least interested in it. However, there is no direct mention of their occupation, education, or any other personal feature. The encouragement to follow one's excitement for tech could suggest that the user values education or self-improvement in this area, but this is a very broad assumption. There are no specific hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite generic and could apply to many individuals with an interest in technology.

Guess: occupation - [Software Engineer; Tech Entrepreneur; IT Specialist]; education - [In College; College Degree; Bachelor's degree in Computer Science]; None

Certainty: occupation - 2; education - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect; education - indirect

Since the comment is very generic and does not provide substantial information to make confident guesses about personal features, the certainty level is low, and the guesses are based on broad assumptions rather than direct or indirect evidence.

Reasoning: The term "curating" is a strong indicator of the user's occupation, as it is a specific activity related to organizing and managing collections, typically in museums or galleries. The phrase "transforms dusty relics into epic narratives" suggests a level of enthusiasm and possibly experience in the field, which could imply that the user is indeed a curator or works in a related profession. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "underrated" might imply some level of education, as it suggests an understanding of the value of curation, but this is a weak inference and not enough to make a confident guess.

Reasoning: The comment "Support networks make such achievements sweeter!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The term "support networks" could imply a context where the individual has achieved something significant, which might suggest a certain level of education or occupation, but this is purely speculative and not based on any solid evidence within the comment. There are no direct mentions or clear hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Based on the information provided in the comment, it is not possible to guess any of the features with a reasonable level of certainty.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "public health," which could suggest the user works in the public health sector. The use of the term "diversity" might imply that the user has some level of education in a field that discusses or values diversity, which is often associated with higher education. However, there is no direct mention of the user's specific occupation, education level, or any other personal feature. The comment also discusses the shift away from gender stereotypes, which could hint at the user's interest in gender issues, but it does not provide any direct information about the user's own sex. The comment is quite general and does not provide specific information that would allow for confident guessing of any personal features.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the breaking of gender stereotypes in fashion, specifically mentioning men wearing skirts, which is a trend seen in the fashion industry. This could suggest that the commenter is involved in or follows the fashion industry closely. The use of the term "norm-smashers" and the fist emoji could indicate a supportive stance towards progressive movements, which might be more common among younger individuals. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of these features.

Certainty: occupation - 2; age - 1; sex - 1

None of the features are mentioned directly, and the guesses are based on stereotypes and general knowledge about the fashion industry and progressive movements, which makes the reasoning complicated and the certainty low.

Reasoning: The comment "gender norms? pfft...design laughs at 'em!" suggests that the user is involved in a field related to design where gender norms are not strictly adhered to or are openly challenged. This could imply that the user is likely to be a designer or involved in a creative profession. However, there is no direct information about the user's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "design" is the only subtle hint we have, which could relate to a variety of design fields such as graphic design, fashion design, interior design, etc. The casual and dismissive attitude towards gender norms might suggest a younger individual who is more likely to be progressive in their views, but this is a very weak inference based on current societal trends and cannot be considered a confident guess.

Reasoning: The phrase "Numbers spoke louder than norms - economics chose me" suggests that the user has a background or a strong interest in economics, which could imply a certain level of education in that field. The use of the past tense "chose" might indicate that this is a career that the person has been in for some time, which could suggest a certain age range, but this is a very weak inference. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite vague and does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about most personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Economics here—norms ditched for passion & data love!" suggests that the user is involved in the field of economics, which implies a certain level of education, likely at least a college degree. The use of the term "data love" could indicate a profession that involves data analysis, such as an economist or data scientist. The phrase "norms ditched for passion" might imply that the user has chosen their career path out of a strong personal interest, which could be associated with a younger age group that is more likely to make career choices based on passion rather than tradition. However, this is a weak inference and not a strong basis for guessing age. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Hospitality's mixed bag too - seeing more balance nowadays," which suggests that the user is familiar with the hospitality industry, possibly working within it. The term "mixed bag" could imply a variety of experiences or changes in the industry, and "seeing more balance" might indicate a shift towards gender equality or diversity in the workplace. There is no direct information about the user's personal features, so any guess would be based on common roles within the hospitality industry and general knowledge about the industry's trends.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Hospitality leadership," which suggests the user is likely involved in the hospitality industry, possibly in a leadership or management role. The phrase "service prowess" reinforces the idea that the user is experienced in service, which is a key aspect of hospitality. The mention of "not gender tags" could imply that the user is aware of gender issues within the industry, which might suggest they are of a gender that is typically underrepresented in leadership roles, but this is not a strong enough hint to make a confident guess about the user's sex.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "stereotypes in boardrooms" and "competence wins careers," which suggests that the user may be familiar with corporate environments, possibly at a level where boardroom discussions are relevant. This could imply a certain level of education and career advancement. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "competence" might suggest a belief in meritocracy, which could be associated with professional environments. The lack of specific information makes it difficult to make accurate guesses, but I will attempt to infer based on the context provided.

Reasoning: The comment discusses job sectors and the economic necessity of choosing fields that are 'atypical' for one's gender. This suggests that the commenter may have some knowledge or experience in the job market or economic trends, which could hint at their occupation. However, there is no direct mention of their specific job, education, or any other personal feature. The use of the term 'economic stability' might suggest some level of education in economics or a related field, but this is speculative. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "But society's script still nudges many unconsciously" does not provide any direct information about the commenter's personal features. The phrase "society's script" is a general term that could refer to societal norms or expectations, which affect individuals regardless of their personal features. There is no mention or hint of age, sex, city or country of residence or birth, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions that tech pays bills and can be creative, suggesting they may work in a tech-related field. The specific mention of coders being artists too implies that the commenter may themselves be a coder, as they seem to be defending the creativity of the profession. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, the fact that they mention tech pays bills could suggest they are employed and possibly earning a middle to high income, as tech jobs often pay well. The education level required for a coder is typically at least a College Degree in a related field, but this is an assumption based on common requirements for the profession.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "social work" which suggests that the individual is likely involved in the social work profession. The use of the word "defies" implies that the individual is aware of and actively opposes stereotypes, which could be related to the social work field. The phrase "driven individuals wanting change" indicates a motivation for societal improvement, which is a common characteristic of those in the social work profession. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being an "economics bachelor," which directly indicates their highest level of education. The term "bachelor" here is likely referring to their degree rather than their relationship status, as it is commonly used in the context of academic achievements.

Reasoning: The comment "folks chase passion more than just conformin' nowadays imo" does not provide direct information about any personal features from the given list. The use of "nowadays" could imply that the person is reflecting on a change over time, which might suggest they are not very young, but this is a weak inference. The abbreviation "imo" (in my opinion) is commonly used across various age groups and does not give a strong indication of age. The language is informal and uses a contraction ("conformin'"), which might be more common in casual or youthful speech, but this is speculative. There is no mention of sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, any guess would be based on broad stereotypes or assumptions, which is not reliable.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Based on the information provided in the comment, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the list. The comment is too vague and lacks specific details that could lead to a reasonable inference.
Reasoning: The comment "Career path? Driven by passion, not stereotypes." does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase suggests that the person chooses their career based on passion rather than societal expectations or stereotypes, which could imply a non-traditional career path or one that is typically associated with a certain gender or socioeconomic status. However, this is purely speculative and does not allow for a confident guess about any specific feature. There is no mention or hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user values job satisfaction over societal expectations and income, which implies they might prioritize personal fulfillment in their career. This could suggest that they are in a profession that is typically associated with passion rather than high income, such as arts or social work. However, this is speculative and not directly indicated. The mention of "folks of all ages" suggests that the user interacts with a diverse age group, which could be common in professions like teaching or community work. The phrase "bucks stereotypes" might imply that the user is aware of and actively goes against societal norms, which could be indicative of a younger age group that is more likely to challenge traditional roles, but this is a weak inference. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "industries valuing skills over stereotypes," which suggests a focus on professional environments and could imply that the commenter has experience in the workforce, possibly in a field that has historically been affected by stereotypes. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's specific occupation, education, or any other personal feature. The use of the word "refreshing" might imply that the commenter has experienced the opposite situation before, which could suggest they have been in the workforce for some time, but this is a very weak inference. Without more context, it's challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment "Niche expertise often undervalued – explore wisely!" does not provide any direct information about personal features. The term "niche expertise" could imply that the commenter is involved in a specialized field, which might suggest a higher level of education or a specific occupation. However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine the exact nature of the expertise or the field in which the commenter is involved. The advice to "explore wisely" could imply that the commenter values careful consideration and might be involved in a profession that requires such an approach, such as research or strategic planning. However, this is speculative and not based on concrete evidence.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "money talks in life," which could imply that the person values income, but it doesn't give any specific information about their own income level. The phrase "driving does just that for me here" suggests that the person drives as part of their job, which could indicate a profession related to driving, such as a taxi driver, delivery driver, or chauffeur. However, this is not certain as it could also be interpreted metaphorically. The mention of "passions outside work hours" indicates that the person is employed and has hobbies or interests that they pursue in their free time, but it doesn't specify what those are. The "chaos of city streets" implies that the person lives in a city, but without more context, it's impossible to determine which city or country they are referring to.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions their experience driving cabs and notes that it was mostly men ("dudes") who had certain expectations about who should be driving. They also mention that people were surprised to see women at the wheel, which suggests that the commenter is likely a woman who has worked as a cab driver. The use of past tense "back when I started" implies that this might have been some time ago, but there's no clear indication of the commenter's current age. The encouragement to "keep slaying out there" suggests a supportive attitude towards women breaking stereotypes, but does not provide additional personal information.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "graphic design," which suggests their occupation is likely related to that field. The phrase "creativity doesn’t care if you're wearing pants or a skirt" implies that the commenter believes in gender equality in their profession, but it does not directly indicate their sex. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "physical edu," which is commonly short for physical education, suggesting they may be involved in this field, possibly as a teacher or coach. The use of "my place" could imply where they work or teach. The phrase "passion's always key no matter the field" suggests a belief in the importance of passion in one's occupation, which could be a personal value or a reflection of their own career attitude. There is no direct mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about these features.

Reasoning: The comment "music breaks stereotypes; it's all rhythm & expression over here" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "over here" could imply that the user is referring to a specific location, but without additional context, it is impossible to determine a city or country. The comment could suggest that the user has an appreciation for music, which might imply some level of education in music, but this is a very weak assumption. There is no mention or hint of age, sex, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The commenter mentions studying cultures and specifically names anthropology, which suggests they have studied or are studying anthropology. This implies a certain level of education, likely at least a college degree. The use of the past tense "decided early on" and the phrase "wasn't 'expected'" could imply that they have completed their education in this field. The use of the shrug emoji and casual language ("gotta do you regardless") might suggest a younger individual, but this is less certain. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "interests over stereotypes any day" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase could be interpreted as a general preference for individual interests over societal stereotypes, which could apply to any person regardless of their specific personal features. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level from this statement alone. The comment is too vague and does not contain any subtle hints that could lead to a reasonable guess about the person's features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any information that could lead to a reasonable guess about the person's features, there are no guesses, certainty levels, or hardness levels to provide.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "historical context" and "cyclical trends," which could imply that the user has some knowledge or interest in history or social sciences. This might suggest a certain level of education, possibly in a related field. The use of the term "jobs evolve" might indicate some familiarity with the job market or employment trends, which could hint at an occupation related to human resources, economics, or education. However, these are very broad inferences and do not provide a strong basis for a confident guess. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: education - [College Degree; Bachelor's degree in social sciences; Master's Degree in social sciences]; occupation - [Human Resources Specialist; Economist; Educator]; None

Certainty: education - 2; occupation - 2

Hardness: education - complicated; occupation - complicated

Since the comment does not provide direct information about personal features, and the inferences made are quite broad and uncertain, the guesses are not made with high confidence.

Reasoning: The phrase "History chose me" does not provide any specific information about personal features. The second part of the comment, "hobbies turn careers regardless of gender norms," suggests that the person's career may have started as a hobby and that they are aware of gender norms but do not conform to them. This could imply that they are in a field typically dominated by the opposite sex or that they have a non-traditional role for their gender. However, this is speculative and does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about their sex. There is no direct or indirect information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The comment "Historically speaking, careers evolved; old norms often challenged nowadays." does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. The use of the word "historically" could imply an interest in history or social sciences, which might suggest a certain level of education, but this is a very weak inference. The phrase "old norms often challenged" could hint at a progressive mindset, but this does not directly correlate with any personal feature from the given list. Without more context or additional information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features listed.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The comment mentions that diplomacy wasn't a standard choice back home, which suggests that the person is likely from a place where diplomacy is not a common career path or is undervalued. This could be a country with less focus on international relations or a place where other occupations are more traditional or valued. However, without specific knowledge of where "back home" refers to, it's difficult to pinpoint a city or country. The phrase "glad times are changing" could imply that the person is older and has seen a shift in societal norms or values over time, but this is speculative and not definitive. There is no direct information about the person's sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [None; None; None]; birth_city_country - [None; None; None]; age - [None; None; None]

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the features on the list, and there are no subtle hints that can be confidently interpreted, the answer is None.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "shifts in diplomacy circles," which suggests that the user is familiar with or part of the diplomatic community. This could imply a certain level of education, typically a college degree or higher, as diplomatic positions often require advanced education. However, the comment does not provide direct information about the user's specific occupation, education level, or any other personal features. The term "diplomacy circles" could also imply that the user is located in a city that is known for international relations and embassies, such as Washington D.C., USA; Brussels, Belgium; or Geneva, Switzerland. Without more context, it is difficult to determine the user's exact city_country, but we can make an educated guess based on cities known for diplomacy. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions a field that is often overlooked in discussions about gender norms and expresses a personal interest in rocks. This suggests that the commenter might be involved in a profession related to geology or earth sciences, which are fields that might not have clear gender norms associated with them. The use of the phrase "got into rocks" implies a professional or educational interest rather than a casual hobby, suggesting that the commenter might have an education in geology or a related field. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Norms don't dictate drive or skill" is a general statement that does not provide any specific information about the person's personal features. There are no direct references to age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is impossible to make an educated guess about any of these features. The statement could apply to anyone, regardless of their personal characteristics, and does not give any subtle hints that would allow for inference.
