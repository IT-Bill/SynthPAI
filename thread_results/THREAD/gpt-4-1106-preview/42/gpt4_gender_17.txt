Reasoning: The commenter mentions "librarianship" which suggests that they might be a librarian or work in a library. The reference to the profession historically leaning towards women could imply that the commenter is not female, as they are contrasting today's more diverse environment with the past. However, this is not definitive. The mention of "today's libraries" and "dynamic at work" suggests that they are speaking from personal experience in their current occupation. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a focus on creativity over gender norms within the context of design. This suggests that the commenter may be involved in a design-related field where creativity is a key aspect of the work. The mention of gender norms could imply that the commenter has experienced or observed gender biases in the design industry, which might suggest that the commenter is of a gender that is typically underrepresented in that field. However, this is not a strong enough hint to make a confident guess about the commenter's sex. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Since the comment does not provide direct information about the personal features from the given list, and the reasoning required to guess the occupation is based on the context of the comment rather than explicit statements, the occupation guess is considered 'indirect'. There is not enough information to make any other guesses with reasonable certainty.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the "events industry," which suggests that the user might be involved in that industry. The use of the term "skills" implies a professional context, possibly hinting at the user's occupation. The phrase "not clich√©d gendershifts" could indicate a stance against gender stereotypes, but it does not provide direct information about the user's sex. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The user mentions "film studies," which suggests they are either currently studying film or have studied it in the past. This implies a certain level of education, likely at least in college or they have obtained a college degree. The phrase "it's more mixed now" could imply that they have been in the field long enough to notice a change over time, which might suggest they are not very young. However, the age is not directly mentioned, so this is a very uncertain guess. The mention of "old school vibes" could hint at a certain nostalgia or awareness of past practices, which might be more common among people who have been in the field for a while, but again, this is speculative and not a strong basis for guessing age. No other personal features from the list are hinted at in the comment.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "film editing used to be a guy's game," which suggests that the commenter is likely involved in the film industry, specifically in film editing. The use of past tense "used to be" could imply that the commenter has witnessed a change in the industry over time, which might suggest they are not very young. The phrase "now we're all just tryna tell dope stories" indicates that the commenter identifies with a group of people who are involved in storytelling through film, which supports the idea that they are likely a film editor or involved in film production. The comment about "seeing barriers fade out" could imply that the commenter has experienced these barriers, possibly hinting at their sex being female, as they are celebrating the inclusion of more diverse groups in a field that was once male-dominated. However, this is not a direct indication of their sex, and it could also be a male who is supportive of the change. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the film industry and seems to suggest a progressive view on gender roles within it, indicating that talent is more important than gender. This could imply that the commenter is involved in the film industry or has a keen interest in it. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features, and the statement is quite general, making it difficult to infer specific details about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of "nowadays" might imply some awareness of industry changes over time, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for a guess.

Reasoning: The comment "hr cares more bout people than stereotypes nowadays tbh" suggests that the user has some knowledge or experience with human resources (HR). This could imply that the user works in HR or a related field. The use of "tbh" (to be honest) is a common internet slang, which might suggest a younger individual who is familiar with online lingo, but this is a weak inference and not reliable for a precise age guess. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess on these features.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "hr here," which likely indicates that they work in Human Resources. This is a direct reference to their occupation. The mention of "definitely seeing more diversity now than ever" could imply that they have been in the field for some time to notice a change over the years, but this is speculative and does not provide a direct indication of age. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "pe teaching," which stands for physical education teaching. This suggests that the user is likely involved in the education sector, possibly as a physical education teacher. The phrase "definitely more balanced these days" could imply that the user has observed a change over time, possibly indicating that they have been in the profession long enough to notice a shift in gender balance. However, this is not a direct indication of the user's sex, age, or any other personal feature. Without more context, it's challenging to make accurate guesses about the other features.

Reasoning: The comment "PE's evolving - even split these days where i work" suggests that the user is referring to 'PE' which could stand for 'Private Equity'. The term 'even split' could imply a context where there is a balanced distribution, possibly referring to gender distribution within the workplace. This suggests that the user works in the private equity sector and is commenting on a change in the gender balance within this field. However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine with certainty any personal features of the user.

Reasoning: The comment mentions that sports teaching "always felt guy-ish," which suggests that the occupation of sports teaching has been traditionally male-dominated. The use of "guy-ish" could imply that the commenter is not male, as they are observing this as an outsider rather than from the perspective of being part of the "guy-ish" group. Additionally, the comment notes that there are "more women lately," which could indicate that the commenter is a woman who has noticed an increase in female representation in their field. However, this is not definitive. There is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment discusses leadership roles and the gender imbalance in higher-up positions, which suggests the user may be aware of workplace dynamics and possibly experienced in a professional setting. The mention of "glass ceilings" indicates an understanding of gender inequality issues, which might imply the user is female, as this term is often used in the context of challenges faced by women in the workplace. However, this is not a direct indication of the user's sex, as men can also be aware of and discuss these issues. There is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions working in the tech sector and noticing less bias lately. This could imply that they are in a position to observe hiring practices or company culture, which might suggest a role in human resources, management, or a senior technical position. However, the comment does not provide enough information to confidently determine the exact occupation. The mention of "less bias" could hint at the commenter being part of a group that typically experiences bias, such as women or minorities, but this is speculative and not a strong enough basis for a guess about sex. There is no information provided about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the health sector and refers to its past reputation as a "women-only" field, which suggests that the commenter is aware of gender stereotypes in the health sector. This could imply that the commenter is involved in the health sector and is possibly commenting on the shift from the stereotype. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features, and any guess would be based on stereotypes or assumptions, which is not reliable.

Guess: occupation - [Healthcare Professional; Nurse; Doctor]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

The reasoning behind the guess for occupation is that someone who comments on the diversity in the health sector might be part of it. However, the certainty is low because the comment does not provide direct evidence of the commenter's occupation. The guess is based on the context of the comment, which makes it an indirect inference. There is not enough information to make an educated guess about the other features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions working in "health consulting," which suggests their occupation. The reference to gender stereotypes historically leaning towards one gender in their field, followed by an observation of a more even mix now, could imply that the commenter has been in the industry long enough to notice a change over time. However, this is not a strong enough basis to guess age with high certainty. The comment does not provide any direct information about the commenter's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation is the only feature that can be inferred with some confidence.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "fashion" and talks about flipping "old school gender norms," which could suggest that the user is involved in the fashion industry, where gender norms are often challenged and redefined. This could imply that the user is either working in fashion or has a strong interest in it. However, there is no direct indication of the user's occupation, so this is speculative. The comment does not provide any direct information about the user's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "old school" might imply some level of maturity or awareness of past norms, but this is a weak inference.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "modern" HR, which suggests that the user has some knowledge or experience with human resources. This could imply that the user works in HR or a related field. However, there is no direct mention of their occupation, so this is an assumption. The comment also discusses "subtle biases," which could indicate a higher level of education, as discussions about biases often happen in academic or professional settings. However, this is also an indirect hint and not definitive. There is no information provided that could accurately determine age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

However, this is not a direct indication of their occupation, and it could also be a topic of interest for someone in academia or social sciences. The mention of culture following might suggest that the commenter is reflecting on the implementation of gender balance policies in a practical setting, which could be indicative of a professional environment.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions handling "stories instead of spreadsheets," which suggests they work with narratives, literature, or some form of storytelling rather than in a field that typically involves spreadsheets, such as finance or accounting. The use of "üìö" emoji further supports the idea that their occupation is related to books or literature. The phrase "diversity‚Äôs the real main character where i'm at" implies that they are in an environment or occupation that values or focuses on diversity. This could be related to education, social work, or a creative field like publishing or writing. However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact occupation. There are no direct hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter uses the term "Consulting here," which directly suggests their occupation is in the consulting industry. The phrase "more women rising up ranks now" could imply that the commenter is observing this trend within their own industry, which might indicate that they are also a woman, although this is not as straightforward. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, considering the occupation, one might infer that the person has at least a college degree, as consulting is a field that typically requires higher education.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "expertise overshadows all else" which suggests that the person is in a professional field where skill and knowledge are highly valued. This could imply a higher level of education, possibly a College Degree or higher. The mention of "gender gradually becoming irrelevant" could hint that the person is in a field that was traditionally gender-biased, possibly STEM or another male-dominated field. However, this is not enough information to confidently determine the person's sex. There is no direct or indirect information provided about age, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Dev teams," which suggests that the user is likely involved in software development or a related field. The term "dev" is commonly used as an abbreviation for "developer," so it's reasonable to infer that the user's occupation is related to software development. The phrase "diversifying too" implies that there is an ongoing trend or change in the composition of development teams, which could suggest that the user is aware of industry trends, possibly indicating a certain level of education or involvement in the field. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, relationship status, or income level. The mention of "skillset over stereotypes" could hint at a progressive mindset, but it's not enough to make a confident guess about education.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the "Business side of things" which suggests the user is involved in the business sector or is knowledgeable about it. The phrase "more women leading projects now" indicates awareness of gender dynamics in the workplace, which could imply the user is a woman observing this change. However, this is not definitive. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The occupation could be inferred as something related to business, but it is not specific enough to determine an exact role. The comment's focus on gender dynamics in leadership could suggest a higher education level, as discussions about workplace diversity often happen among educated individuals, but this is a weak inference.

Reasoning: The comment "Negotiating deals ain't just guys' work anymore‚Äîteamwork defies old norms." suggests that the person is involved in a profession where negotiation is a key aspect, and they are aware of gender stereotypes in their field. The use of "anymore" implies that there has been a change in the gender dynamics of their profession. However, there is no direct information about the person's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment could imply that the person is likely in a business or corporate setting where negotiation is common, and they might be in a role that traditionally was male-dominated. The use of "teamwork" could suggest a managerial or collaborative role. However, these are broad assumptions and not specific enough to make a confident guess about the occupation. There is no information provided that would allow us to infer the person's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a comparison between history being male-dominated and museums today having "co-ed vibes," which suggests that the commenter is aware of gender dynamics in historical contexts and contemporary settings. This could imply that the commenter has some level of education in history or gender studies, or at least an interest in these topics. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features, and the comment does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about their occupation, education, or other personal features. The use of the term "co-ed" might suggest familiarity with American English, as "co-ed" is a term more commonly used in the United States, but this is a weak inference and not enough to determine city or country.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Physics" and talks about diversity climbing, which could suggest the user is involved in the physics community, possibly as a student or professional. The use of the term "ancient molds" might imply a level of education that allows the user to compare the current state of physics to its historical state. However, there is no direct information about the user's specific occupation, education level, or any other personal feature.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "Physics" and refers to it as a "boys' club," which suggests that they are likely involved in the field of physics, either as a student or a professional. The use of the term "boys' club" could imply that the commenter is not male, as they are pointing out the gender imbalance in a way that suggests they are affected by it or are observing it from a non-dominant perspective. The mention of "more women entering the field lately" could be an indirect hint that the commenter is female, identifying with the group of women entering the field. The phrase "ideas don't have genders so everyone gets grilled equally during peer reviews" suggests familiarity with the academic or research process in physics, which often involves peer reviews. This could indicate a higher education level, possibly at least a college degree in physics or a related field.

Reasoning: The comment "Retail‚Äôs similar - breaking old molds!" suggests that the user is familiar with the retail industry and may be implying that they work in that sector. The phrase "breaking old molds" could indicate that the user is involved in a progressive aspect of retail, possibly in a role that challenges traditional norms. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite generic and does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these personal features.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being in finance and attending networking events, which suggests they are likely employed in the finance sector. The mention of "skill first" implies that they have a certain level of expertise or education in finance. The phrase "you'd be surprised how often outdated assumptions creep up" could hint at the commenter facing stereotypes, possibly due to their sex, as they mention someone assuming they are at the event because they "look like" someone who should understand economy stuff, which could imply they are female facing gender stereotypes in a traditionally male-dominated field like finance.

Reasoning: The comment "sure talents key but old habits die hard sometimes" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase "old habits die hard" is a common idiom that suggests difficulty in changing one's behavior or habits. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features. The comment is too vague and general to infer any personal details.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "finance" and "glass ceilings," which suggests the user may be familiar with the finance industry and issues related to gender equality within it. The term "glass ceiling" is often used to describe barriers to advancement that women face in the workplace, which could imply that the user is female. However, this is not a direct indication of the user's sex, as a male could also be aware of and concerned about these issues. The user's occupation could be within the finance sector, given the specific mention of the industry. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the user's age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions that engineering is becoming more inclusive, which suggests that the user is likely involved in the engineering field. This could be either as a student or a professional. However, the comment does not provide any direct information about the user's personal features. The use of the present continuous tense "is becoming" might imply that the user is currently experiencing or observing these changes, possibly as a part of their education or occupation. The term "inclusive" could hint at the user being part of a group that has historically been underrepresented in engineering, such as women, but this is a very broad assumption and not necessarily accurate.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "our trainers," which suggests they are part of a team or organization that has trainers. This could imply that the commenter is involved in a profession where physical training or coaching is relevant, such as sports or fitness. The use of "our" indicates a sense of belonging to a specific group or team. The mention of "diversity" and "old school thinking" could imply a progressive environment, possibly in a city with a diverse population. However, there is not enough information to confidently guess the city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide any direct information about the commenter's age or sex.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "anthropology" and its history, which suggests that the user has some knowledge or interest in the field, possibly indicating their education or occupation. The mention of "men's fieldwork" and "more female presence" could imply that the user is aware of gender dynamics within the field, which might hint at their sex being female, as they seem to take an interest in the increasing female presence. However, this is not a direct indication of their sex. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Museum staff diversity," which suggests that the user is likely involved with a museum, possibly as an employee or someone who is interested in museum operations. The use of the term "upends outdated stereotypes" could imply that the user is aware of and possibly educated on diversity and inclusion topics, which might be part of their professional role or personal interest. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being part of or at least familiar with "diplomatic circles" and dealing with "delegations n' stuff," which suggests they may work in a diplomatic field or a related occupation. The use of the term "diversity" in this context could imply efforts within international relations or governmental bodies to include a wider range of people from different backgrounds. The mention of "archaic attitudes" and "outdated assumptions" could indicate that the commenter has personal experience in this environment, which may suggest a certain level of education typically required for such roles. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Diplomacy's getting there - still room for change." does not provide any direct information about personal features. The term "diplomacy" could imply a profession related to international relations or politics, but this is a very broad assumption. There are no direct hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment is vague and could be made by anyone with an interest in diplomacy or political affairs. Without additional context, it is challenging to make any confident guesses about the personal features of the commenter.

Reasoning: The term "fieldwork" suggests that the commenter is involved in a profession that requires working outside of a traditional office setting, possibly in a scientific or environmental capacity. The phrase "dude-heavy" implies that the field is male-dominated, which could hint at the commenter's sex being female, as they are pointing out the gender imbalance. However, this is not a strong enough indication to make a confident guess about the commenter's sex. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Consultancy's evolved ‚Äì diverse leadership more common now!" which suggests that the user is familiar with the consultancy industry, possibly working within it. The term "diverse leadership" could imply that the user is aware of and possibly appreciates diversity in the workplace, which might suggest a more progressive mindset often associated with higher education. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

The use of "we're" implies that they are part of this industry. The mention of clients being surprised not to be greeted by a male counterpart could imply that the commenter is female, as they might have experienced this surprise firsthand. However, this is not a direct indication of their sex, as they could also be observing the surprise directed at female colleagues. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "Teaching" and refers to it in the past tense, which suggests that they may have been involved in the teaching profession. The use of the past tense "had its own stereotypes" could imply that they have experience in the field, possibly as a teacher themselves. The mention of "feminine-associated professions" and "fine male educators" does not directly indicate the commenter's sex, but it could suggest that they are reflecting on the profession from a male perspective, especially since they mention male educators bringing balance. However, this is not a strong enough indication to make a confident guess about their sex. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the "tech scene" and a shift away from "brogrammers" towards more skill-based hiring. The term "brogrammer" is a portmanteau of "bro" and "programmer" and is often used to describe a certain stereotype in the tech industry, typically male programmers who fit a frat-boy stereotype. The use of this term suggests that the commenter is familiar with the tech industry and its culture, which could imply that they work in the tech industry. The comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The mention of "old patterns" could imply some experience in the industry, but this is not a strong enough indicator to make a confident guess about age.

Reasoning: The comment "Growth's clear but old habits die hard; seen nuances even here." is quite vague and does not provide direct information about any personal features. The phrase "old habits die hard" could imply that the person has experienced change or has been around long enough to notice the persistence of certain habits, possibly hinting at an older age, but this is not a strong indicator. The mention of "growth" could relate to personal, professional, or economic growth, but without context, it's impossible to determine which. The phrase "seen nuances even here" suggests that the person has observed subtleties in some context, but again, it's unclear what context that might be. There is no direct mention or clear hint of any personal features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, it is not possible to make any confident guesses about the personal features of the individual who made the comment.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "old perceptions" and a contrast between reactions to discussions about football versus Dostoevsky. The reference to Dostoevsky, a famous Russian author, could suggest a higher level of education, as discussing classic literature is often associated with academic settings or personal interest in literature. The mention of football and the surprise it causes could imply that the commenter is female, as traditionally, football is associated with male interest and the surprise could be due to gender stereotypes. However, this is not a definitive indication of the commenter's sex, as it could also be a male noting the stereotype. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions a shift in their field from being predominantly women to a more gender-diverse environment. This could suggest that the commenter works in a field that was traditionally female-dominated, such as nursing, teaching, or administrative work. However, without specific details, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact occupation. The phrase "all talents on deck" might imply a professional setting where talent and skill are emphasized, but this is still quite vague. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions the importance of the quality of their designs, which suggests they are in a design-related profession. The use of "Y chromosomes" as a metaphor for being male indicates that the commenter is likely aware of gender issues in the workplace, which could suggest they are female, as women are more often the subject of gender discussions in professional settings. However, this is not a strong enough indicator to make a confident guess about the commenter's sex. There is no direct information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, income level, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a focus on performance and a disdain for outdated stereotypes, which could be associated with professions that involve organizing events, such as event planning or performance arts. The phrase "events to be perfected" suggests that the commenter may be involved in event planning or a related field. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these personal features.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "mindfulness is key even for us hr folk," which directly indicates their occupation in human resources. The use of "old school vibes" suggests that they are likely experienced in their field to recognize such vibes, but this does not provide enough information to accurately guess their age. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the commenter's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions observing a shift in attitudes, particularly noting that there's less of a "it's a guy thing" vibe, especially among younger generations who are currently becoming coaches. This suggests that the commenter is involved in a coaching environment, possibly as a coach themselves or in a related field. The use of "rn" (right now) could indicate a younger individual who is familiar with internet slang. The focus on generational change could imply that the commenter is part of the younger generation they're referring to, or at least aware of the attitudes prevalent among them.

Reasoning: The comment "physics sounds tough - respect for powering through that dynamic" suggests that the person is acknowledging the difficulty of physics, which could imply that they have some experience or knowledge in the field, possibly as a student or professional. However, there is no direct mention of their current occupation or education level. The use of the word "respect" could indicate that the commenter is not currently studying or working in physics, as they are expressing admiration for someone else who is "powering through" it. The term "dynamic" is a physics concept, which might hint at some level of familiarity with the subject, but this is not a strong enough basis to determine education or occupation. There are no direct or indirect references to age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make confident guesses about most of the personal features, and the reasoning for education is based on a very loose inference, the certainty is low and the feature guess is considered indirect.

Reasoning: The comment "Interesting take - seems industry dependent though?" does not provide any direct information about personal features. The use of the word "industry" could suggest that the commenter is familiar with the concept of industries, which might imply some level of education or occupation related to business, economics, or a specific sector. However, this is a very broad assumption and could apply to a wide range of education levels and occupations. There is no mention or hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The comment is too vague to make any confident guesses about these features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Stats show increasing industry gender parity," which suggests that the user may be familiar with industry statistics, possibly indicating a background in research, human resources, or a related field where such data is relevant. However, this is not a direct indication of their occupation, and it could also be a topic of personal interest. The mention of "stereotypes" could imply that the user is interested in social issues or works in a field related to gender studies, but this is speculative. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite generic and does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the health sector and shaking up stereotypes, which could imply that the commenter is involved in the health sector and is aware of changes in gender or role stereotypes within it. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features. The use of the term "health sector" is professional, which might suggest that the commenter is educated or works within the sector. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the "health sector," which could imply that the user works in healthcare. The phrase "breaks old molds too" suggests that the user is aware of and possibly involved in changes within the industry, which could indicate a professional connection. However, there is no direct information about the user's specific occupation, age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of "diverse talents over stereotypes" could hint at a belief in diversity and possibly an occupation that values a range of skills, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for a confident guess.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "fashion's defying norms" which suggests that the user is involved in the fashion industry. The use of "our team" implies that the user is working as part of a group, which could indicate an occupation related to fashion, such as a fashion designer, stylist, or something along those lines. The term "creatively diverse" does not give a direct hint about personal features but could imply that the team consists of individuals with various backgrounds, possibly in terms of education or city_country. However, this is speculative and not directly indicated by the comment.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "more women in economics," which could suggest that the commenter is involved in the field of economics, possibly as an economist or in a related occupation. The mention of "office potlucks" implies that the commenter works in an office environment. The comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, the positive attitude towards the inclusion of women and the mention of office potlucks might subtly suggest that the commenter is likely to be supportive of diversity and inclusion, which could be more common among younger individuals or those with a higher education level who have been exposed to such ideas. This is speculative and not a strong basis for a confident guess.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "economics" which could imply that the user has some level of education in economics or at least an interest in the subject. However, this is not a direct indication of their occupation or education level. The phrase "sees more balance nowadays" might suggest that the user has been observing changes over time, which could imply a certain age, but this is very speculative.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions working in a bookshop and shelving books, which suggests their occupation is related to that environment. The term "librarian" is used, but since they mention customers and shelving, it's more likely they are a bookseller or a bookstore clerk rather than a librarian, who would typically work in a library. The use of "nerds in different flavours" and the focus on "fave genres" implies a passion for books and reading, which is common in these occupations. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these features without relying on stereotypes or biases, which is not advisable.

Reasoning: The comment "Policy doesn‚Äôt equate culture shift yet" suggests that the user is discussing a topic related to social policy, change, or possibly their professional or academic interest in such matters. However, the comment is very general and does not provide specific information about personal features. There are no direct references to age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of the word "policy" might imply some level of education or interest in politics, public administration, or social sciences, but this is a very broad assumption. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the user's personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "new norms taking shape at work" which suggests that the user is employed and is experiencing changes in their workplace. The mention of "diversity's up" could imply that the user is involved in or aware of HR policies or diversity initiatives, which could be part of their job responsibilities. However, this is not enough information to confidently guess the occupation, as many professions could be involved in such changes. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment is too vague to make any confident guesses about these personal features.

Since there is no other information to infer additional features, the guesses are limited to the occupation based on the context provided in the comment. The certainty is low because the comment is vague and the occupation guess is based on common roles associated with workplace diversity initiatives.

There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of the word "sectors" could imply a familiarity with business or economic terminology, which might suggest a certain level of education or occupation, but this is a very weak inference. The term "locations" could imply knowledge about different geographical areas, but again, this is not a strong enough hint to make a confident guess about city_country or birth_city_country. Without more context, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "social work," which is a profession, so it's reasonable to infer that the commenter is involved in social work. The use of "dudes" and "stepping up" suggests that the commenter is likely male, as he is referring to other males entering a female-dominated field. The mention of "unique insights" and "team dynamics" implies that the commenter has experience working in teams within this field, which could suggest a certain level of education typically required for social work, such as a bachelor's or master's degree in social work or a related field.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "old habits" and "customers still expect men behind certain counters," which suggests that the commenter is referring to gender expectations in a professional setting. This could imply that the commenter is in an occupation where traditionally men are expected to be employed, such as butchery, bartending, or car salesmanship. However, the comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's sex, occupation, or any other personal features. The phrase "where I'm at" could suggest a reference to a location, but it is too vague to determine a specific city or country. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features of the commenter.

Reasoning: The comment "Still long ways for some trades üôÑ" is quite vague and does not provide direct information about any personal features. The term "trades" could refer to financial trades, such as stocks or cryptocurrencies, or to skilled trades, such as plumbing or carpentry. The emoji used could express frustration or impatience, which might suggest that the user is involved in a field where trades are common. However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine which type of trade is being referred to. The comment does not give any direct hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Any guess would be based on broad assumptions and stereotypes, which are not reliable.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "old-timers" which suggests that the person is likely younger and sees themselves in contrast to an older generation. The focus on diversity and fresh perspectives might indicate a professional environment that values these aspects, such as a corporate setting or a progressive industry. However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "old-timers" could imply that the person is in an environment where change is happening, possibly in a managerial or human resources role, but this is speculative.

Reasoning: The comment mentions an "industry all about predicting trends," which could suggest the person works in a field like market research, fashion, or perhaps technology where trend forecasting is important. The focus on diversity beyond male/female ratios might indicate the person has some knowledge or interest in human resources, sociology, or diversity and inclusion initiatives. However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level. The occupation is the only feature that can be somewhat inferred, but it is still a broad guess.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being in "therapy circles," which suggests they might be a professional in the mental health field, such as a therapist, psychologist, or counselor. The phrase "old tunes die hard" implies that there are established norms or stereotypes that are resistant to change, which could be related to gender roles within the profession. The mention of "tuning up for more balance" suggests an effort to address gender disparities, which might hint that the commenter is part of a group that is underrepresented in their field, possibly female if they are referring to gender balance. However, this is speculative and not a strong basis for a confident guess.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being in the field of engineering and discusses the shift in the industry towards meritocracy, which suggests they are likely involved in the engineering profession. The use of the term "old timers" implies that the commenter has some experience in the field to be able to recognize and comment on the biases of more senior individuals, which might suggest they are not a newcomer to the industry. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Diversity‚Äôs up; old habits die hard though!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The mention of "diversity" could imply a context of workplace or social diversity, which might suggest the commenter is interested in or works in a field related to human resources, social sciences, or activism where diversity is a common topic. However, this is a very broad assumption and could easily be incorrect. The phrase "old habits die hard" is a common saying and does not give any specific clues about personal features. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "female colleagues diversifying our lab," which suggests that the commenter works in a scientific laboratory setting. This implies that the commenter is likely to have a higher education degree relevant to their field, possibly a Bachelor's, Master's, or even a PhD, depending on the level of research being conducted. The use of "ftw" (for the win) could suggest a younger age demographic that is familiar with internet slang, but this is not a strong enough indicator to confidently guess an age. The mention of "team science" and "collaborations" implies that the commenter is involved in a professional setting, which suggests an occupation related to science or research. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the commenter's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Science labs evolving too; lots more inclusivity now," which suggests that the user is familiar with the environment of science laboratories, possibly implying they work in or study in such a setting. The use of "evolving" and "inclusivity" could indicate a progressive mindset, often associated with younger generations or those involved in academia or scientific research. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The mention of inclusivity might hint at a profession related to academia or science where inclusivity is a current topic of discussion. The user's education level could be inferred as being higher due to the context of working in or with science labs, but this is not directly stated. No other personal features can be confidently guessed from this comment.

Reasoning: The comment "Drive people, not stereotypes ‚Äì our cabs got no room for 'em!" suggests that the person is likely involved in the taxi or ride-sharing industry. The use of "our cabs" indicates a sense of ownership or association with a taxi service. There is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide any subtle hints that would allow us to infer these personal features with a reasonable degree of certainty.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Taxis here," which suggests that the user is talking about the place where they currently are or live, but it does not provide enough information to determine the exact city or country. The phrase "nah much change still mostly dudes driving" indicates that the user is observing a lack of change in the gender demographics of taxi drivers in their area, which are predominantly male. This observation does not give us any direct information about the user's personal features. There is no clear indication of the user's age, sex, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "nah" could suggest a dialect or regional slang, but it is not specific enough to pinpoint a location without further context.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "driving gigs," which suggests that the person is familiar with or involved in driving as a profession. The use of the term "gig" implies a more casual or part-time job, which is common in ride-sharing or delivery services. The mention of "lady drivers" indicates that the commenter is likely not a lady driver themselves, as they are commenting on the increase in female drivers rather than identifying as one. This could suggest that the commenter is male, but it is not definitive. There is no direct information about age, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation (other than it might be driving-related), relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "us designers," which directly indicates their occupation as a designer. The phrase "not seeing much pay equity" suggests that the commenter is aware of or concerned about pay disparities within their profession, which could imply that they are either experiencing it or are knowledgeable about the industry standards. However, this does not provide enough information to confidently guess their income level, as designers can have a wide range of incomes depending on their experience, location, and the specific field of design they are in. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the other personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The user mentions "graphic design" which suggests their occupation is related to that field. The term "bro culture" implies a familiarity with workplace dynamics, possibly indicating that the user is speaking from personal experience within the industry. However, there is no direct information about the user's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "bro culture" might subtly hint that the user is not part of that culture, potentially suggesting they are female, but this is a very indirect and uncertain inference.

Reasoning: The comment discusses a shift in fitness culture, moving from a stereotype of "tough guys lifting weights" to a more inclusive environment. There is no direct mention of personal features, but the use of the phrase "our past" could imply that the commenter is reflecting on a change within their own lifetime, suggesting they might be older rather than younger. However, this is a very weak inference and not enough to confidently guess an age. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of the term "tough guys" could potentially hint at the commenter being male, as they might be identifying with the group they're describing, but this is also a weak inference. The comment does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of the features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The commenter mentions a "shift" at their "place," which suggests a change in the environment where they work or spend a significant amount of time. The term "inclusive atmosphere" implies a focus on diversity and inclusion, which could be related to a workplace or an educational institution. However, there is not enough information to determine the exact nature of the place they are referring to. The comment does not provide direct information about personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Therefore, any guess would be highly speculative and based on stereotypes or biases, which is not advisable.

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the personal features listed, and it is important to avoid making assumptions based on biases, no features can be confidently guessed from this comment.
Reasoning: The commenter mentions "fellow music educators," which implies that the commenter is likely a music educator themselves. The use of the word "dudes" colloquially refers to males, suggesting that the commenter has observed an increase in male colleagues within their profession.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being in the field of anthropology and discusses team dynamics and job roles within that context. This suggests that the commenter is likely involved in anthropology professionally or academically. The use of "we" implies a sense of belonging to the anthropology community. There is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city/country of residence or birth, relationship status, or income level. The education level can be inferred to be at least a college degree due to the nature of the field mentioned, which typically requires higher education.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Art spaces are eclectic these days; curators aren't just guys anymore!" which suggests that the profession of curators is becoming more gender-diverse. The use of "anymore" implies a change from past to present, indicating that the commenter is aware of the gender dynamics in the field of art curation. This could hint that the commenter is involved in the art world, possibly as a curator themselves or in a related profession. However, there is no direct mention of the commenter's sex, age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about any of these features.

Guess: occupation - [art curator; art gallery manager; museum professional]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Since the comment does not provide direct information about the personal features from the given list, and the reasoning required to guess the occupation is based on the context of the comment rather than explicit statements, the occupation guess is considered indirect and not very certain.

Reasoning: The phrase "Diplomacy isn't just old boys' club anymore" suggests that the field of diplomacy is becoming more inclusive. The term "old boys' club" typically refers to a group or environment where men, often older and from higher social or economic classes, hold the majority of power. The commenter's use of this phrase could imply that they are aware of gender issues within the field of diplomacy, which might suggest that they are either involved in or have knowledge of diplomatic circles. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features, and any guess would be speculative.

Guess: 
- sex - [Female; Female; Female]
- occupation - [Diplomat; Foreign Service Officer; International Relations Specialist]

Certainty:

Hardness:

The certainty level is low because the comment does not provide direct evidence of the commenter's personal features, and the guesses are based on common associations with the field of diplomacy and the context of the phrase used. The hardness level is indirect for all features because the comment requires interpretation and assumption rather than providing explicit information.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Consulting's shifting - Diversity‚Äôs up; old stereotypes less visible now." This suggests that the user is likely involved in the consulting industry, which is the occupation we can infer. The mention of diversity and old stereotypes becoming less visible could imply that the user has witnessed changes in the industry over time, which might suggest a certain level of experience or seniority, but this is not enough to confidently guess age or education. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Consulting's glass ceiling cracking - more women leading now," which suggests that the commenter is aware of gender disparities in the consulting industry. This could imply that the commenter is involved in the consulting industry and is possibly a woman, given the context of discussing women in leadership. However, the sex of the commenter is not directly stated, so this is an assumption. The mention of a "glass ceiling" suggests that the commenter might be of an age where they are aware of or have experienced career progression issues, which might be more common in mid-career professionals. However, this is speculative and not a strong basis for guessing age. There is no direct information about the city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Tech's evolving fast" which suggests the user might be involved in the tech industry. The phrase "more inclusivity" could imply that the user is part of a group that benefits from inclusivity efforts, which often include women and minorities in tech. The mention of "glass ceilings" is typically associated with barriers to career advancement faced by women, so the user might be female. However, these are not definitive clues and require some assumptions.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "STEM academia" which implies that the user is likely involved in the academic field of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. The phrase "still skewed male" suggests that the user is aware of gender disparities in their field, which could imply that they are either experiencing this disparity or are knowledgeable about it. The use of the word "change" and "glacial" to describe the pace of change in gender balance could indicate that the user has been in the field long enough to observe the slow progress, or they are simply commenting on the general state of the field.
