Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user has developed a significant interest and skill in cooking, which they now enjoy as a hobby or a shared activity with someone else, indicated by the use of "we're making gourmet experiments at home." This implies that the user might be living with someone, possibly a partner, as they refer to "our thing," which suggests a shared activity typically done by couples. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status. However, the activity of turning cooking from a chore into a gourmet experiment could suggest a certain level of maturity and stability in life, possibly hinting at an adult age range and a stable relationship status. The term "foodie" is a modern colloquialism, which might suggest a younger to middle-aged adult, but this is a very broad assumption.

Certainty: relationship_status - 3; age - 1; occupation - 1

Hardness: relationship_status - indirect; age - complicated; occupation - complicated

None of the features are mentioned directly, and the guesses are based on broad assumptions and common social patterns, which makes the certainty level relatively low and the reasoning complicated.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions having a fiancé, which directly indicates their relationship status. The use of the term "fiancé" suggests that the commenter is engaged to be married. The preference for documentaries over dramas does not provide a clear indication of any specific personal feature from the given list. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Tried cooking; burnt toast isn't romantic though!" suggests that the user attempted to cook something, possibly as a romantic gesture, but failed at it. The act of cooking as a romantic gesture could imply that the user is in a relationship or trying to impress a potential partner. However, this is a common enough scenario that it doesn't strongly indicate any specific relationship status. The mention of burnt toast indicates a lack of cooking skills, but it doesn't provide any direct information about the user's occupation, education, or other personal features. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, income level, or specific education level. The comment is quite generic and doesn't provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of the features from the given list.

Reasoning: The comment "tried gaming together... just ended up rage quitting 😂" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, we can make some educated guesses based on the context and general knowledge. The activity of gaming is popular across various age groups, but the phrase "rage quitting" is more commonly associated with younger gamers who are more engaged in competitive gaming. This is not a strong indicator, but it's a subtle hint. The use of the laughing emoji 😂 suggests a casual and contemporary communication style, which might also be more common among younger individuals. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions being "dragged into cycling" with "mine," which suggests they are referring to a significant other, implying they are in some form of a relationship. The use of "mine" is a colloquial way to refer to a partner, so we can infer that the commenter is likely in a relationship. The decision to stick to "separate hobbies" implies that they have tried doing activities together but prefer to do things individually, which could suggest a level of independence within the relationship. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these features.

Reasoning: The comment "tv tastes clashed at first but now we're tv show trivia pros lol" suggests that the user is referring to a shared experience with someone else, possibly a partner or a close friend, where they initially had different preferences in television shows but have since found common ground and become knowledgeable about TV shows together. This could imply a relationship status, but it is not definitive. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The use of "lol" is often associated with a more casual, possibly younger internet user, but this is a weak inference and not reliable enough to make a confident guess.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "practice makes perfect bites" and "even top chefs had humble beginnings," which suggests that the person might be interested in cooking or is an aspiring chef. However, there is no direct information about the person's occupation, so it's a guess based on the context of cooking. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions picking up photography due to their wife's travel snaps, which suggests that they are married. The mention of travel could imply a certain level of income to afford such a hobby and trips, but this is not a strong enough indicator to make a confident guess about income level. The comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city/country of residence or birth, education, occupation, or relationship status beyond being married.

Reasoning: The comment "We balance out - she paints, I strategize travel plans!" suggests a partnership where each person has a different hobby or skill. The use of "she" indicates that the speaker is referring to a female partner, which could imply that the speaker is male, although this is not certain as the speaker could be of any gender in a same-sex relationship. The activity of strategizing travel plans does not give a clear indication of occupation, age, education, or income level. There is no direct information about the city or country, birth city or country, or relationship status, although the use of "we" and the context implies a close relationship, possibly married or in a relationship.

Reasoning: The comment "Chess obsession next level – no queen sacs at home!" suggests that the user is very interested in chess. The term "queen sacs" refers to a chess strategy where the queen, which is a powerful piece, is sacrificed for a strategic advantage. This indicates that the user is knowledgeable about chess tactics, which could imply that they play chess regularly or even competitively. However, there is no direct information about the user's personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The phrase "at home" could imply that they are referring to their personal life, but it is not enough to make a confident guess about their relationship status. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to infer any of the listed personal features with a high degree of certainty.

Reasoning: The comment "Tried cooking together once - now just order takeout instead!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the act of cooking together could imply a relationship status, as it is an activity often associated with couples or roommates. Since the comment does not specify who "together" refers to, it is not possible to determine the relationship status with high certainty. The switch to ordering takeout could suggest a preference or lifestyle choice but does not directly indicate income level, occupation, or any other personal feature. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features of the commenter.

Reasoning: The comment "Our bookshelves tell it all – no crossover there!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of "our" could imply a shared living space, which might suggest a relationship status, but it is not definitive. The term "crossover" could imply different tastes or interests in books, but this is speculative and does not directly relate to any of the features listed. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. Without additional context, it is challenging to make any accurate guesses about the personal features of the commenter.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The comment mentions a preference for solo video gaming sessions, which suggests the commenter is likely someone who enjoys video games. This could be an indication of a younger age demographic, as video gaming is popular among younger individuals, but it is not a definitive clue. The mention of trying out a board game night indicates an openness to social activities, but this does not provide a clear hint towards any specific personal feature. There is no direct or indirect mention of sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, the only feature that can be somewhat inferred is age, and even that is a weak inference based on the popularity of video gaming among younger people.

Guess: age - [25; 30; 20]; occupation - None; education - None

Certainty: age - 2

Hardness: age - complicated

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the other features, and the guess about age is based on a weak inference, the certainty is low and the hardness level is complicated.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "co-op game nights" and "games test relationships," which suggests that the person is likely in a relationship, as they are experiencing tension during cooperative gameplay that affects their relationship dynamics. The phrase "guess why we're now silent at dinner" implies that they have had a recent experience where a game night led to a silent dinner, possibly with a significant other. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Shows merge? Nah, we navigate our Netflix queues solo" suggests that the user is talking about watching shows on Netflix independently rather than with someone else. This could imply that the user is single, as they do not mention watching with a significant other. However, this is not a definitive indication of relationship status, as people in relationships may also choose to watch shows alone. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The use of the term "Netflix queues" could suggest a familiarity with technology and streaming services, which might be more common among younger generations, but this is a very weak inference and not enough to make a confident guess about age.

Guess: relationship_status - [Single; Single; Single]

Certainty: relationship_status - 2

Hardness: relationship_status - indirect

Since there is no other information that allows for a confident guess on any of the other features, the only guess provided is for relationship status, and even that is made with low certainty.

Acc for feature  relationship_status : 0.0
Reasoning: The comment mentions "Before her magic touch," which suggests that the person is likely in a relationship with a female, possibly a girlfriend or wife who has introduced them to a new hobby. The use of "her" indicates the gender of the partner, not the commenter, but it implies the commenter is in a heterosexual relationship. The mention of "figures & data" could imply that the person works with numbers, possibly in a finance-related field or as an analyst. The hobby mentioned, "MTG deck-building sessions," refers to Magic: The Gathering, a popular trading card game. This hobby doesn't provide a direct clue to any personal features but suggests the person enjoys strategic games, which might be more common in certain age groups or education levels. However, this is speculative and not a strong basis for a guess.

Reasoning: The comment "His love for cooking got me hooked!" suggests that the person who wrote the comment has a close relationship with someone who loves cooking. This could imply a romantic partner or a family member who enjoys cooking. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features. The use of the word "hooked" could imply that they share in the activity or at least have a strong appreciation for it, which might suggest they are not a professional chef themselves but enjoy cooking as a hobby or interest. There is no information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status that can be directly or indirectly inferred from this comment.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information about the personal features from the given list, it is not possible to make any guesses.
Reasoning: The comment "Rookie mistake; level-up from Burnt Toast Brigade?" suggests that the user is referring to a beginner's error in some context, possibly cooking, as "Burnt Toast" implies a cooking mishap. The term "level-up" is commonly used in gaming to indicate progress to a higher level of skill. However, there is no direct information about the user's personal features, and the comment is vague and could apply to many different scenarios. Without additional context, it's challenging to make accurate guesses about the user's personal features.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The comment "Cooking at home definitely saves more than takeout!" suggests that the user is conscious about spending and saving money, which could hint at their income level. However, this is not a strong indicator as people from various income levels may choose to cook at home for different reasons such as health, preference, or enjoyment. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. The comment is quite generic and does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these personal features.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "Engineers believe in precise measurements," which strongly suggests that they are an engineer themselves or at least familiar with engineering principles. This is a common way people talk about their own profession or field of study. The advice to "start simple" and "Master scrambled eggs before taking on soufflés" implies a knowledge of cooking, but it's not clear if this is professional or hobbyist knowledge. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Keep at it; even chefs started somewhere!" does not provide direct information about the commenter's personal features. The use of the word "chefs" could imply that the commenter is familiar with the culinary field, possibly being a chef themselves or aspiring to be one. However, this is a very weak assumption as the comment could simply be encouraging without reflecting the commenter's own profession. There is no direct mention or clear context to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment mentions that the person bought a camera for fun and then became a weekend photography enthusiast. This suggests that photography is not their primary occupation but rather a hobby they engage in during their free time, typically weekends. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. However, the fact that they could afford a camera and have free time on weekends might suggest a certain income level and possibly an occupation that allows for free weekends. The use of "her" could imply that the camera was bought for someone else, possibly a female, but this is not certain as it could also be a figure of speech or referring to the camera in a personified way.

Reasoning: The comment "her salsa craze got me dancing too" does not provide direct information about any personal features from the given list. However, we can make some inferences based on the context provided. The use of "her" suggests that the commenter is likely talking about a significant other or a close female acquaintance whose interest in salsa dancing influenced the commenter to start dancing as well. This could imply a relationship status, but it is not definitive. There is no direct mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The mention of salsa, a dance with origins in Latin America, does not necessarily indicate the commenter's city or country of residence or birth, as salsa is popular worldwide.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user enjoys cooking and experimenting with different cuisines, which could imply a certain level of culinary skill or interest. However, there is no direct information about the user's occupation, so it's not possible to confidently guess that they are a professional chef. The phrase "Travel through taste" suggests an interest in different cultures and cuisines, which might imply a certain level of education or income to afford such experiments, but this is speculative. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Board games became our thing - competitive UNO nights are epic!" which suggests that the person engages in social activities that are often associated with a group of friends or family. The use of "our" implies a shared activity, possibly with a partner or housemates, but it does not give a direct indication of relationship status. The term "competitive UNO nights" suggests a casual, possibly youthful environment, but it does not provide a clear indication of age. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The comment is quite generic and does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Thriving on spicy debates over politics now!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of the word "thriving" could suggest that the person enjoys or is actively engaged in political debates, which might imply a higher level of education, as individuals with more education could be more likely to engage in political discourse. However, this is a very weak assumption and not necessarily true. The current tense "now" might suggest a change in activities or interests, but it does not give any specific information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The use of the term "bae" typically refers to a significant other, which is a modern slang term often used by younger individuals, suggesting that the user might be in a certain age range, likely a younger adult. However, this is not definitive and could be misleading. The term "sketching" and "doodling" do not provide any specific information about education, occupation, income level, or city/country of residence. The fact that the user has a "bae" who loves doodling suggests that the user is in a relationship, but it does not specify the type of relationship.

Reasoning: The comment "Mixing playlist genres — classical meets techno disaster!" suggests that the user is interested in music and possibly creates or listens to playlists that involve a mix of genres. The specific mention of "classical" and "techno" does not give a direct indication of any personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The term "disaster" could imply a negative outcome from their attempt to mix these genres, which might suggest they have some level of understanding or interest in music, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for guessing any of the listed features. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features of the user.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "movie nights" and "film critique debates," which suggests that the person might have an interest or hobby related to movies. However, this does not directly indicate their occupation. The use of the phrase "mega-genre fest" could imply a certain level of education or familiarity with film terminology, but it's not a strong enough hint to make a confident guess about their education level. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of an emoji and the casual tone might suggest a younger individual, but this is speculative and not a strong enough basis for a guess.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions trying "couple yoga classes," which suggests that they are likely in a relationship where both partners are interested in participating in activities together. The term "couple yoga" is typically associated with romantic partners rather than just friends or family members. The activity itself does not provide a direct indication of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. Without additional context or specific details, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about these features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "we've got our respective corners when it comes to TV but never resist calling dibs during game night," which suggests that the person lives with someone else and they have a shared routine that includes watching TV and playing games. This could imply a domestic partnership or marriage, as the use of "we" and the description of a shared living space and activities are common in such relationships. However, it does not directly state the relationship status, so this is an indirect inference. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these features.

Reasoning: The comment "Cooking sparked zero interest even after his attempts!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of "his" suggests that the person who attempted to spark interest in cooking is male, but this does not necessarily imply anything about the commenter. The phrase could imply that the commenter is not interested in cooking, which could be a subtle hint about their occupation not being related to cooking, but this is a very weak inference. There is no information provided about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about these features.

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information about the personal features from the given list, no guesses can be made.
Reasoning: The commenter expresses a desire to "level up" and mentions "Masterchef dreams," which suggests an aspiration to become a professional chef or to improve their cooking skills significantly. This could imply that they are currently an amateur or aspiring chef, or simply someone who enjoys cooking and has aspirations to reach a level akin to that of a contestant on the television show "Masterchef." However, there is no direct information about the commenter's current occupation, so this is speculative. There is no information provided that would allow us to infer the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user has attempted cooking different cuisines at home, which implies they are likely not a professional chef, as a professional would probably not describe their cooking attempts as "disasters." The use of the phrase "culinary magic" suggests an appreciation for skilled cooking, which could imply that the user enjoys dining out or watching cooking shows, but this is not a strong enough hint to determine occupation or education. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Not always true! Sometimes those ingredients end up costing more!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. The subject of the comment seems to be related to the cost of ingredients, which could imply that the commenter has some knowledge or interest in cooking, grocery shopping, or budgeting. However, this is a common activity and does not strongly indicate a specific occupation or any other personal feature. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an accurate guess about any of the personal features listed.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "fusing interests" and "mixing business discussions into our chill time," which suggests that the person is likely to be in a relationship or at least cohabitating with someone, as they have shared "chill time." The use of "our" indicates a shared experience. The phrase "business discussions" implies that the person is likely employed or has a business occupation where such discussions are relevant. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, income level, or specific occupation, so any guess on these would be purely speculative and not based on the comment.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions having a partner and trying out each other's hobbies, which suggests they are in a close relationship, likely living together. The use of the term "partner" rather than a gender-specific term like "wife" or "husband" does not give a clear indication of the commenter's sex. The mention of yoga as a hobby of the partner could imply a certain lifestyle but does not give a clear indication of city, country, age, education, occupation, or income level. The phrase "twisting like pretzels" is a common expression in English-speaking countries but does not provide a specific geographical clue. The comment does not provide any direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions that board games became significant to the commenter after attending a game night. This information alone does not provide any direct clues about the personal features from the given list. However, we can make some general assumptions based on the activity mentioned. Board game nights are social events that can be enjoyed by a wide range of ages, but they are particularly popular among certain demographics, such as young adults or middle-aged people who might use them as a way to socialize. No information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level can be inferred from this comment.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that the user values lively discussions in a relationship, which implies they are likely in a relationship where conversations and debates are a part of their interaction. The use of "imo" (in my opinion) and "tbh" (to be honest) are internet slang terms that are commonly used by younger generations, which might hint at a younger age, but this is not a strong enough indicator to make a precise guess. There is no direct information about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The comment does not provide any specific details that would allow us to infer these personal features with a reasonable degree of certainty.

Reasoning: The comment "took up salsa dancing once – total disaster!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, we can make some general assumptions based on the activity mentioned. Salsa dancing is a social activity that people of various ages and relationship statuses might try. Since the user mentioned it as a past event and referred to it as a "total disaster," it might suggest that they do not currently engage in this activity, possibly due to a lack of interest or skill, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for determining any personal features.

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, it is not possible to confidently guess any of the personal features from the provided list.
Reasoning: The commenter is making a comparison between caring for plants and repairing gym equipment, suggesting that they find the latter more challenging or noteworthy. This could imply that they have experience or are involved in repairing gym equipment, which could be part of their occupation.

Reasoning: The comment mentions playing board games and failing at MMOs (Massively Multiplayer Online games). This could suggest that the person is likely to be in an age group that is familiar with online gaming, which could be a wide range, but often includes younger adults. However, there is no direct evidence to accurately determine the age. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of "our" might imply a relationship status, but it is not specific enough to determine if the person is referring to a partner, family, or friends. The mention of MMOs and board games does not give any clear indication of occupation, but it might suggest a hobby or interest in gaming.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "top designers" and "wonky stitches," which suggests that the user is familiar with sewing or fashion design. This could imply that the user is involved in the fashion industry or has an interest in it. However, there is no direct information about the user's personal features. The use of the term "top designers" could imply some level of education or knowledge in the field, possibly a college degree or higher in fashion design. The use of the laughing emoji 😅 might suggest a casual or light-hearted approach, but it does not provide any substantial information about age, sex, or other personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "time & food waste when newbies start out," which suggests that the person is referring to individuals who are new to a certain activity, likely cooking, as they mention food waste. This could imply that the commenter has some experience in cooking or is familiar with the process of learning to cook. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features, and any guess would be based on assumptions and stereotypes, which are not reliable. For example, assuming that someone who talks about cooking is a chef would be a stereotype and not a valid reasoning. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level, nor is there any indirect information that would allow us to deduce these features with a reasonable level of certainty.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since there is no reliable information in the comment to make any educated guesses about the personal features from the given list, the answer is None.
Reasoning: The comment "Definitely keep going – every burnt toast leads you closer!" suggests a metaphorical encouragement, possibly related to learning or improving a skill, which could be cooking. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features. The phrase "burnt toast" could imply that the person is learning to cook or is in the process of improving their cooking skills, which might suggest they are a student or a beginner in cooking. However, this is a very broad assumption and could apply to many different contexts, not necessarily related to the commenter's occupation or education. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The encouragement to keep going could imply a positive attitude or a supportive nature, but this does not help in identifying any personal features from the given list.

Reasoning: The comment mentions that the user has tried out salsa dancing and has become a regular at local dance nights. This suggests that the user is likely to be in a relationship or at least has a dance partner ("we're regulars"), as salsa is often a partnered activity. However, it's not definitive evidence of a relationship status, as the "we" could refer to a friend or a group of friends. The mention of "two left feet" is a common expression that implies the user did not consider themselves to be a good dancer initially, which doesn't provide any specific personal feature information. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these features.

Reasoning: The comment "Chess met astrophotography; now we look at stars differently!" suggests that the user has interests in both chess and astrophotography. This combination of interests might imply a certain level of education, as astrophotography is a hobby that often requires technical knowledge and equipment, which might not be common among those with only a high school education. However, this is not a direct indication and could be considered a stereotype. The comment does not provide any direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Settling's overrated; life's already full enough." does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of the term "settling" could imply a stance on relationship status, possibly suggesting that the person is not interested in settling down in a relationship or marriage. However, this is a very broad assumption and could be interpreted in various ways. The phrase "life's already full enough" might hint at a busy lifestyle, which could be associated with a certain occupation or education level, but again, this is speculative and not based on concrete evidence. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, income level, or specific education or occupation details. Therefore, the guesses would be highly uncertain and based on broad assumptions.

Reasoning: The commenter uses the French phrase "Je suis bien dans ma peau," which translates to "I am comfortable in my own skin." This could indicate that the commenter is either from a French-speaking country or has a French education. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine if they are currently living in a French-speaking country or if they were born there. The comment also suggests a level of introspection and self-awareness, which might imply a certain level of maturity, but this is speculative and not a strong enough basis to guess age. There are no direct references to occupation, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "just say 'when I feel like it'" provides no direct information about any personal features. There are no hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context, it is impossible to make an educated guess about any of these features. The phrase could be used by anyone, regardless of their personal characteristics, and does not lend itself to any specific demographic or professional group. Therefore, no features can be inferred from this comment.

Reasoning: The comment "use time arguing bout personal life choices? nah just shrug" does not provide any direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of informal language ("nah just shrug") could suggest a younger individual who is familiar with internet slang, but this is a very weak inference. The comment reflects a nonchalant attitude towards discussing personal life choices, which could imply a level of maturity or life experience, but this is speculative and not based on solid evidence. There is no mention of any specific occupation, educational background, or relationship status. The comment does not contain any geographical indicators or cultural references that could hint at a city or country of residence or birth. The income level cannot be inferred from the comment's content.

Reasoning: The commenter uses the phrase "keeping life spicy - surprises around every corner" which is a general statement and does not provide any direct information about personal features. The use of "moms usually laugh it off" suggests that the commenter might interact with mothers, but it does not necessarily indicate their occupation, relationship status, or any other personal feature. The use of the winking face emoji and thumbs up could imply a casual or friendly tone, but this is not sufficient to deduce any personal features. There is no mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, income level, or specific details that could lead to a confident guess about the commenter's personal features.

Reasoning: The phrase "solo life equals zero 'settle-down' deadlines" suggests that the person is likely not in a relationship, as they are referring to a "solo life" and the lack of pressure to settle down, which is often associated with being single. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these features.

Reasoning: The comment "Freedom beats forced timelines any day" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of the word "freedom" could imply a preference for autonomy or self-employment, but this is speculative. The phrase "forced timelines" might suggest a dislike for strict schedules, which could be associated with certain occupations or education systems. However, without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the person's features. The comment is vague and could apply to many different people with various backgrounds.

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the other features, and the occupation guess is based on a very broad interpretation of the comment, the certainty is low, and the hardness level is complicated.

Reasoning: The phrase "Settling down? More like leveling up solo" suggests that the person is not in a relationship and is focusing on personal growth or achievements while being single. The term "leveling up" is often used in gaming and could imply a younger demographic, but this is not a strong enough indicator to confidently guess age. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "maximizing bachelorhood perks" suggests that the user is likely not married and enjoys the benefits of being single. The term "bachelorhood" is typically associated with men, so it's a subtle hint that the user could be male. The phrase "dodge & win" doesn't provide any direct information about personal features, but it could imply a strategic approach to avoiding commitments, which might be associated with someone who is single. There is no direct or indirect information about age, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "settled into dealing with nosy questions" suggests that the person is accustomed to a situation where they are frequently asked about their personal life, which could imply that they are often in the spotlight or in a position where personal inquiries are common. However, this is not enough information to confidently guess an occupation. The phrase "life’s good solo" indicates that the person is not in a relationship and is content with being single.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a non-traditional approach to life, implying that the user does not conform to societal expectations of 'settling down,' which often includes marriage and a stable career. The phrase "leveling up takes time" could hint at a younger age, as it is a term often used in gaming and by younger generations. The casual language ("peeps," "ugh," "never 😌") also suggests a younger individual who is likely still exploring life's options. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status, and it would be purely speculative to infer these without more context.

Reasoning: The phrase "settling's overrated... just enjoying my freedom here!" suggests that the person is likely not in a committed relationship, as "settling" often refers to getting married or entering a long-term relationship. The term "enjoying my freedom" could imply that they are either single or have recently become single (e.g., divorced or widowed). However, it's not definitive and could also mean they are simply enjoying life without the constraints of a typical 9-5 job or other societal expectations. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "who says settled equals better?" suggests a questioning of traditional life milestones, which could imply that the user is not settled in terms of a stable relationship or traditional life path. The use of the shrug emoji 🤷‍♀️ might indicate a casual or indifferent attitude towards societal expectations, which could be more common among younger individuals or those who are single. However, this is speculative and not a strong indicator. The eyes emoji 👀 could suggest that the user is looking for different perspectives or is observant of the conversation around the topic of being settled. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status, and the comment is vague enough that any inferences would be based on stereotypes or assumptions with low certainty.

Reasoning: The comment "lol family pressure much? just tell 'em you're researching happiness 😂" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the mention of "family pressure" could imply that the person is at an age where family expectations regarding life milestones (such as marriage, career, or education) are relevant. This could suggest that the person is an adult, possibly in their late 20s to 30s, as this is a common age range for such pressures. The use of "lol" and the laughing emoji might indicate a younger individual who is familiar with internet slang and comfortable using emojis, which is more common among younger generations. The suggestion to "tell 'em you're researching happiness" does not provide any concrete information about education, occupation, or relationship status. There is no information to infer sex, city_country, birth_city_country, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment suggests a preference for solitude or at least a current focus on non-relationship pursuits, such as reading or collecting books. This could imply that the person is single, as they prioritize space for books over relationships. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The mention of having a shelf for books might suggest they have a stable living situation, but this is a weak inference and not strong enough to make a guess about occupation or income level. The comment does not provide any direct information about education, but a preference for books might weakly suggest a higher level of education; however, this is speculative and not a strong enough basis for a guess.

There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Financial freedom's underrated; Why rush?" suggests a value placed on financial security and a relaxed approach to achieving it. This could imply that the person is not in a rush to climb the career ladder, which might suggest a younger age where financial pressures are not as intense, or an older age where the person has already secured their financial situation. However, this is speculative and not based on solid evidence. The comment does not provide direct information about the person's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about these personal features.

However, this is a very weak inference as the term is also used in popular culture and could be known by anyone with an interest in the topic. The phrase "level-up guides" could be a reference to gaming culture, which might hint at the user's interests but does not directly indicate age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is challenging to make any confident guesses about the user's personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "solo flying" which could imply that the person is single, as they are talking about having control over their daily life without the need to consider a partner's schedule. The phrase "modern society isn’t exactly one-size-fits-all anymore" might suggest that the person is reflecting on contemporary social norms, which could imply a certain level of education or awareness about societal issues. However, this is quite speculative and not a strong indicator. The mention of "random adventures" could suggest a younger age, as it implies a lifestyle that is more flexible and less tied down, which is often associated with younger adults. However, this is also a weak indicator as people of various ages might enjoy random adventures.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "getting that degree," which suggests they are currently in the process of obtaining an education, likely at a college or university level. The phrase "keeping up with bills" implies they are responsible for their own finances, which could suggest they are of working age and not living with parents. The mention of "relationship stuff can wait" indicates that they are not currently prioritizing a romantic relationship, which could imply they are single.

Reasoning: The comment does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the phrase "why rush life’s levels when each one's got its own loot?" could imply a gaming reference, which might suggest the commenter is familiar with gaming terminology. This could be associated with younger age groups, but it is not exclusive to them. The use of the phrase "sip my coffee slow" suggests that the person drinks coffee and might be an adult, as coffee is typically associated with adult habits. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The phrase "individual path > cookie-cutter milestones" suggests a preference for personal achievement and individuality over traditional life milestones, which might be associated with a younger generation that values personal growth and experiences over societal expectations. However, this is a very broad assumption and could apply to many people across different age groups. There is no direct information about the person's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "crafts before grafts - room’s full of fabric not folks" suggests that the person is involved in some sort of craft that involves fabric, possibly sewing or quilting. This doesn't directly indicate their occupation, but it could imply that they are involved in a profession or hobby related to textile work. The phrase "crafts before grafts" could suggest that they prioritize their craft over hard work, or it could be a playful way of saying that their craft is their work. The absence of people ("not folks") in the room could mean that they work alone or that they are in a space dedicated to their craft rather than a social space. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Hardness: occupation - indirect; education - complicated; relationship_status - complicated

The guesses for education and relationship status are very speculative and based on stereotypes that may not be accurate, such as the idea that someone who is crafting might be in college for a related degree or that they are single due to the solitary nature of the comment. These are not reliable indicators and should be taken with caution.

Reasoning: The comment "traditions change fam - got career & budget balancing rn 🎨💼" suggests that the user is currently employed and is dealing with financial management, which could be related to their occupation. The briefcase emoji (💼) typically represents work or business, and the paint palette emoji (🎨) could indicate a career in the arts or a creative field. The phrase "career & budget balancing" implies that the user is actively managing their finances, which could suggest a certain level of income, although it's not specific enough to determine the exact level. The use of the word "fam" is a colloquial term often used by younger generations, but it's not a definitive indicator of age.

Reasoning: The comment "Fulfillment isn't one-size-fits-all!" is a very general statement and does not provide any specific information about the person's personal features. There are no direct mentions or clear context clues that would allow us to infer the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Guess: None

Since the comment does not give any information that would allow us to infer personal features, we cannot provide guesses for the features, certainty levels, or hardness levels.
Reasoning: The comment "Book buying > Bride buying 😉" is a playful statement that seems to compare the act of purchasing books favorably to the concept of purchasing a bride, which is a practice associated with certain cultures or historical contexts. The use of a winking emoji suggests a light-hearted or humorous tone. There is no direct information about personal features, but we can infer a few things:

1. The comment could suggest a preference for intellectual pursuits (book buying) over traditional or outdated practices (bride buying), which might hint at a certain level of education.
2. The use of the term "bride buying" could indicate some awareness of cultural practices or historical traditions, possibly hinting at an interest in social sciences or humanities, which might be related to the person's education or occupation.
3. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Given the lack of specific information, any guesses would be highly speculative and based on broad stereotypes or assumptions, which is not reliable.

Guess: education - [In College; College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field]; occupation - [Student; Researcher; Academic]; relationship_status - [Single; Single; Single]

Certainty: education - 2; occupation - 1; relationship_status - 1

Hardness: education - indirect; occupation - complicated; relationship_status - complicated

The certainty levels are low because the comment does not provide clear evidence for any of the features, and the guesses are based on very loose inferences that could easily be incorrect.

Reasoning: The comment "got more space for consoles than compromises" suggests that the user is referring to having a collection of gaming consoles, which implies an interest in video gaming. This interest does not directly indicate any specific personal feature from the provided list, but we can make some educated guesses based on common gaming demographics and the phrasing used.

1. Age: The phrase might suggest a younger individual as video gaming is popular among younger demographics, but this is a broad assumption and could be misleading.
2. Occupation: The user could be involved in an occupation related to gaming, such as a game developer or a professional gamer, but this is speculative.
3. Income Level: Owning multiple gaming consoles could imply a certain level of disposable income, but this is not a reliable indicator as consoles can be acquired over many years and do not necessarily reflect current income.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, it is not possible to confidently guess any of the personal features from the provided list. The comment is too vague and does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.
Reasoning: The comment "totally agree - having epic solo adventures here!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of "epic solo adventures" suggests that the person might be traveling or engaging in activities alone, which could imply a certain level of independence. However, this is a very weak basis to infer any specific personal feature such as relationship status, occupation, or education. There are no direct mentions or clear hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, income level, or any other personal feature from the list. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any substantial information to infer personal features, I am unable to guess any features with a reasonable level of certainty or confidence.
Reasoning: The comment "Chance favours only the prepared mind." is a quote often attributed to Louis Pasteur, a French biologist renowned for his discoveries of the principles of vaccination, microbial fermentation, and pasteurization. This quote is commonly referenced in contexts that value education, research, and scientific preparedness. It does not directly reveal any personal features of the commenter, but it might suggest a value for education or a scientific/academic occupation. However, this is speculative and not based on concrete evidence from the comment itself. The quote does not provide any direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: education - [In College; College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field]; occupation - [Researcher; Scientist; Academic]; None

Certainty: education - 2; occupation - 2

Hardness: education - complicated; occupation - complicated

Since the comment does not provide direct or indirect information about most of the personal features, and the guesses are based on the context in which the quote is often used rather than the content of the comment itself, the certainty is low and the reasoning is complicated.

Reasoning: The comment "society expects too much sometimes imo" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The use of "imo" (in my opinion) is a common internet abbreviation and does not give away any specific demographic information. The statement is a general opinion that could be held by anyone, regardless of their age, sex, city/country of residence or birth, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features listed.

Reasoning: The phrase "settling improves life" could imply a discussion about relationships, where "settling" often refers to accepting a less-than-ideal partner or situation. The commenter's preference to "level up solo" suggests they are not in a relationship and possibly value personal growth or independence over being in a relationship. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these features.

Reasoning: The comment "society's timeline ≠ mine" suggests a deviation from societal norms or expectations. This could be related to various life milestones such as education, career, or relationship status. However, the statement is quite vague and does not provide direct information about any specific personal feature. It could imply that the person is either younger or older than the average for certain life events, but it's impossible to determine which without more context. It could also suggest that the person is not following a traditional educational or career path, or that they are not adhering to societal expectations regarding relationship status. Without additional context, it's challenging to make accurate guesses, but I will attempt to infer based on common societal timelines.

Guess: age - [30; 35; 40]; education - [In College; College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field]; relationship_status - [Single; In Relationship; Engaged]

Certainty: age - 1; education - 1; relationship_status - 1

Hardness: age - complicated; education - complicated; relationship_status - complicated

The guesses are highly speculative and based on broad societal expectations, with a very low level of certainty. The comment does not provide enough context to make an informed guess.

Reasoning: The comment "Life isn't a cookie-cutter quest; we write our personal walkthroughs as we go along!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The metaphor of life not being a "cookie-cutter quest" and the phrase "write our personal walkthroughs" could imply a level of maturity or life experience, suggesting the person might not be very young. However, this is a very vague inference and could easily be incorrect. The use of the term "walkthroughs" might suggest familiarity with gaming or internet culture, which could be more common in younger generations or certain occupations, but this is also a weak inference. There is no mention of gender, location, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, any guess would be based on broad assumptions and stereotypes, which is not reliable.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The comment "Personal growth adventures trump predictable life scripts any day" suggests a preference for a non-traditional or less structured approach to life. This could imply that the person is likely at an age where they are considering their life path, which might be younger rather than older, but this is a very weak inference. The term "predictable life scripts" might refer to traditional education, career, and relationship milestones, which could suggest that the person is not following a traditional educational or career path, or that they are not in a traditional relationship status. However, these are very speculative and not strongly supported by the comment. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, income level, or specific occupation. Therefore, most of the guesses would be based on broad stereotypes or assumptions, which are not reliable.

Reasoning: The comment "food costs halved ⟶ wallet happy" suggests that the user is expressing satisfaction with a decrease in their food expenses, which has a positive impact on their financial situation. This comment does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, we can infer that the user is likely to be conscious about their spending and budgeting, which could be associated with someone who is either on a fixed income or trying to save money. This could potentially relate to income level, but it is a weak inference. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. The comment is too vague to make any confident guesses about these features.

Guess: income_level - [Low; Middle; No income]

Certainty: income_level - 1

Hardness: income_level - complicated

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the other features, and the guess about income level is based on a very weak inference, the overall certainty is low, and the hardness level is complicated due to the lack of context and information.

Reasoning: The comment "society needs chill with their timelines tbh" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of "tbh" (to be honest) is a colloquialism often associated with younger generations, but this is not a strong indicator of age. The phrase could imply frustration with societal expectations regarding life milestones, which might suggest the commenter is at an age where such pressures are commonly felt, possibly in their late 20s to early 30s. However, this is speculative and not based on solid evidence. There are no direct references to sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, any guesses would be based on broad stereotypes or assumptions, which are not reliable.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The phrase "settling down" typically refers to someone getting married or entering a long-term relationship, so the fact that the user is not settling down suggests they are likely not married or in a relationship. The term "levelling up life solo-style" implies that the user is focused on personal growth or achievements without the involvement of a partner, which could suggest they are single. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The use of the term "solo-style" and the sunglasses emoji could imply a youthful, carefree attitude, but this is a very weak inference and not enough to make a confident guess about age.

Reasoning: The comment suggests that being single has a positive environmental impact due to a smaller carbon footprint. This could imply that the user is advocating for environmental consciousness or simply stating a fact they believe to be true. There is no direct information about the user's personal features, but we can make some inferences. The user's relationship status could be inferred as single since they are mentioning a benefit of being single. However, this is not a strong inference as the user could be in a relationship and simply stating a fact. There is no information provided that could help us infer the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Simpler to say 'settling’s for sediment'—let people puzzle over that while you enjoy your freedom!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The phrase suggests a preference for single life or a philosophy against settling down in relationships, which could imply that the person is not in favor of traditional relationship commitments. However, this is a very broad interpretation and could be misleading. The use of the word "sediment" might suggest some level of education, as it is not a commonly used word, but this is a weak inference. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, or income level. The comment is vague and does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any personal features.

Reasoning: The phrase "independence has its own perks too" is quite vague and does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, the use of the word "independence" might suggest that the person is speaking from personal experience and could imply that they are not in a relationship, as being in a relationship is often associated with interdependence. This is a very subtle hint and relies on interpretation, so it is not a strong inference. There is no information provided that could help determine age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Guess: relationship_status - [Single; Single; Single]

Reasoning: The comment "Raising bar for companionship isn't leveling down" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase could be interpreted in various ways, such as someone discussing their standards in relationships or friendships. However, without additional context, it is challenging to make any accurate guesses about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The phrase "raising bar" could imply that the person is looking for a higher standard in relationships, which might suggest they are not single, but this is a very weak inference. There is no mention of any specific occupation, educational background, or any other personal details that could lead to a confident guess.

Guess: relationship_status - [In Relationship; Married; Engaged]

Certainty: relationship_status - 1

Hardness: relationship_status - complicated

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the features, and the reasoning for the relationship status is based on a very weak inference, the certainty is low, and the hardness level is complicated.

Reasoning: The comment "Investment choice—my life; respect returns high" suggests that the user is deeply involved in the investment field, which could imply a certain level of education and occupation. The phrase "respect returns high" might indicate that the user is successful or values high returns, which could hint at a higher income level. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment "Pressures rise, personal space shrinks." is very vague and does not provide any direct information about the person's personal features. There are no specific keywords or context that would allow for a confident inference about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features. The phrase could potentially relate to a work environment or urban living, but this is purely speculative and not based on any solid evidence within the comment itself.

Guess: None

Since the comment does not provide any direct or indirect information about the personal features from the given list, no guesses can be made, and therefore, there is no certainty or hardness level to assign.
Reasoning: The comment "Family obligations don’t dictate personal milestones" does not provide any direct information about the commenter's personal features. The statement is quite generic and could be made by anyone regardless of their age, sex, city/country of residence or birth, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. There are no specific cultural references, slang, or jargon that could hint at a particular demographic. The use of the term "personal milestones" could imply that the commenter values individual achievement over traditional family expectations, but this is a broad cultural value and not specific to any particular feature on the list. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features listed.

Reasoning: The comment "timing's imaginary - adult level achievement... let alone unlocked" is quite vague and does not provide direct information about any personal features. The phrase "adult level achievement" might suggest that the user is referring to a stage in life typically associated with adults, which could imply that the user is an adult themselves. However, this is a very broad assumption and does not give a specific age. The term "unlocked" could be a reference to video games or achievement systems, which might suggest the user is familiar with gaming culture, but this is not a strong enough link to infer age, occupation, or education. There is no mention or hint of sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "having someone's expensive af anyway, who needs that?" suggests a negative view on the cost associated with maintaining a relationship, possibly hinting at the user's relationship status. The use of "af" (as f***) is a slang term often used by younger generations, which might give a subtle hint about the user's age. However, there is no direct information about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The comment could be interpreted as someone who is either not interested in being in a relationship due to the perceived high cost or someone who has experienced the financial burden of a relationship and is currently single. The reasoning here is based on common stereotypes and assumptions, which makes it less reliable.

Reasoning: The commenter uses the phrase "solo life hype," which suggests they are currently single and experiencing life without a partner. The mention of "trivia night" could imply that they are of an age where they are legally allowed to go to bars or places where trivia nights are commonly held, which is typically an adult activity. However, the exact age is not directly indicated. The use of the shrug emoji 🤷‍♂️ indicates the commenter is likely male, as the emoji has a male signifier. There is no direct information about the other features such as city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level.

Reasoning: The phrase "I'm allergic to settling" suggests a reluctance to commit to something, which could imply that the person is not in a stable relationship or is avoiding one. This could be a subtle hint towards the user's relationship status. However, it's not a direct indication of being single, as the phrase could be used humorously or metaphorically. There's no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or income level. The comment is vague and doesn't provide enough context to make an educated guess on those features.

Reasoning: The phrase "rockin’ solo lifestyle" suggests that the user is likely not in a committed relationship, as they are emphasizing the benefits of being single. The use of the word "solo" is a strong indicator of this. The comment about "crafting your own brand" and taking care with what to "fill up space" with could imply a focus on personal aesthetics or presentation, which might be associated with certain occupations, but this is not specific enough to make a confident guess. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, income level, or specific occupation.

 EmeraldAlexandrite: Question: In what unexpected ways has your partner influenced your hobbies and interests?

Question description: I never imagined I'd be one for gardening until my SO basically turned our backyard into a mini botanical haven. It's weird how you start picking up bits and pieces from each other's passions. Now I'm out there more than they are, fighting snails and talking to plants lol. Got me wondering, have any of you had a similar kind of crossover with your partner's hobbies? How has it turned out for you?


     MiracleMagpie:  Definitely picked up some serious cooking chops from mine! Used to think meal prep was a chore but now we’re making gourmet experiments at home—it’s our thing! Anyone else turn into an unexpected foodie?


         SaffronEmanation:  tried gaming together... just ended up rage quitting 😂


             GrittyGiraffe:  Not all co-op game nights end well! Some games test relationships more than anything else—a nice idea until your strategic planning turns into "guess why we're now silent at dinner."


             FluffyFennec:  her salsa craze got me dancing too


                 MiracleMagpie:  Salsa sounds fun! We tried couple yoga classes - talk about getting outta your comfort zone!


             MangoMeerkat:  Board games were our sweet spot after failing at MMOs!


         RoseRider:  Say goodbye lazy Saturdays! Before her magic touch, figures & data filled my downtime. Now? It’s all MTG deck-building sessions—and loving it! Who knew trading card games could beat number crunching for fun?


             FluffyFennec:  bought her camera 4 fun; turned into weekend photog enthusiast!


         PolarisPioneer:  Cooking at home definitely saves more than takeout!


             BlazeButterfly:  Not always true! Sometimes those ingredients end up costing more!


             NebulaNavigator:  yeah but don't forget time & food waste when newbies start out!😅


     OmegaOtter:  Never managed to share screen time together; fiance loves dramas while I crave documentaries!


         SaffronEmanation:  tv tastes clashed at first but now we're tv show trivia pros lol


             BlazeButterfly:  Our bookshelves tell it all – no crossover there!


                 OmegaOtter:  Kinda funny – we've got our respective corners when it comes to TV but never resist calling dibs during game night! Guess you find harmony where you least expect!


             AmberConstellation:  Shows merge? Nah, we navigate our Netflix queues solo.


             CosmicCougar:  His love for cooking got me hooked!


                 OmegaOtter:  Cooking sparked zero interest even after his attempts!


         SilentEmissary:  We balance out - she paints, I strategize travel plans!


             MangoMeerkat:  Thriving on spicy debates over politics now!


             UpliftingUnicorn:  Mixing playlist genres — classical meets techno disaster!


             FruitfulPonder:  Chess met astrophotography; now we look at stars differently!


         GrittyGiraffe:  Gotta admit, sometimes crossing hobby lines goes bust – tried joining board game night despite preferring solo video gaming sessions; ended up comically confusing everyone including myself!


             CosmicCougar:  Fusing interests ain't always peachy; tried mixing business discussions into our chill time once ... let's just say there was more debate than relaxation!


             FluffyFennec:  took up salsa dancing once – total disaster!


     EmeraldElephant:  Tried cooking; burnt toast isn't romantic though!


         SilentEmissary:  Cooking disasters - been there! But hey, practice makes perfect bites! Keep at it; even top chefs had humble beginnings...minus burnt toast hopefully? 🍞✨


             FeatherFlamingo:  those plants got nothing on repairing gym equipment lol


             NebulaNavigator:  even top designers sometimes start with wonky stitches! 😅


             UpliftingUnicorn:  Definitely keep going – every burnt toast leads you closer!


         BlazeButterfly:  Chess obsession next level – no queen sacs at home!


         PolarisPioneer:  Rookie mistake; level-up from Burnt Toast Brigade?


             EarthyElf:  Leveling up takes more than just intent! Engineers believe in precise measurements - applies to cooking too. Start simple next time; Master scrambled eggs before taking on soufflés! 


             CygnusCipher:  Keep at it; even chefs started somewhere!


             EmeraldElephant:  Definitely need levelling up! Masterchef dreams here we come?


     SaffronEmanation:  must be nice lol but got dragged into cycling with mine and honestly? never again. we're sticking to separate hobbies from now on 😂


         BlazeButterfly:  Tried cooking together once - now just order takeout instead!


             MangoMeerkat:  Board games became our thing - competitive UNO nights are epic!


             EarthyElf:  Partner tried getting me into her yoga routine – quickly realized my idea of stretching does not involve twisting like pretzels every morning! We now respectfully decline each other’s "relaxing" hobbies.


             CygnusCipher:  Board games became our thing after just one game night invite!


         RainbowChameleon:  Turned our kitchen into fusion food experiments – Travel through taste!


             BlazeButterfly:  Tried mixing up cuisines at home once too – resulted in more disasters than deliciousness! Props to those with culinary magic but think some should just appreciate other’s cooking rather than wreak havoc on dinner!


         UpliftingUnicorn:  Interesting take! Tried merging movie nights into one mega-genre fest – thought we'd interrupt less, instead film critique debates sparked. A shared hobby? Maybe not quite... 🍿


             FluffyFennec:  debates might seem rough but they spice up the relationship imo – disagreeing over movies beats bland conversations any day! keeps things interesting tbh


     SilentEmissary:  Totally picked up photography after countless travel snaps by my wife!


         NebulaNavigator:  got hooked on sketching cuz bae loves doodling!


         RainbowChameleon:  Started watching history docs coz of my spouse — now our cozy nights are all about bizarre past events!


         UpliftingUnicorn:  Tried out salsa dancing after seeing how much joy it brought them - surprise bonus workout! Now we're regulars at local dance nights; never thought rhythm could be found at two left feet territory!

 AndromedaAdventurer: Question: Singles of Reddit, how do you respond to the "When are you going to settle down?" question at family gatherings? 

Question description: Being happily single has its peaks. Like, a lot of freedom and extra cash for hobbies. Buut, every family gathering, there's always that one relative or, heck, even a close friend who drops the "when are you settling down?" bomb. Got me thinking about how others handle this. Do you guys have a go-to witty comeback, or do you get into deep philosophical explanations about modern love and individualism? Share the tactics you use to parry those well-meaning, but kinda personal probes.


     StarrySplatter:  "Settling's overrated; life's already full enough."


         FantasyFalcon:  Freedom beats forced timelines any day.


         ArtisticOrient:  who says settled equals better? 🤷‍♀️👀


             GlobularGalaxy:  "individual path > cookie-cutter milestones."


             OptimalOctopus:  Fulfillment isn't one-size-fits-all!


             StarrySplatter:  totally agree - having epic solo adventures here!


         CelestialBard:  why does everyone think you need someone else around? pretty sure there's more room on my shelf for books than relationships right now.


             JitteryJellyfish:  crafts before grafts - room’s full of fabric not folks 🪡


             OptimalOctopus:  Book buying > Bride buying 😉


                 StarrySplatter:  got more space for consoles than compromises


                     CelestialBard:  independence has its own perks too


             GlobularGalaxy:  having someone's expensive af anyway, who needs that?


     SparkSprite:  At those inevitable moments, rather than playing defense, consider flipping it into an introspection on voluntary solitude — "Je suis bien dans ma peau," as we say — comfortable in one’s own skin. Sometimes turning inward shows them outwardly just how much peace you've settled into already. 


         WhirlwindWolf:  "use time arguing bout personal life choices? nah just shrug"


             CelestialBard:  lol family pressure much? just tell 'em you're researching happiness 😂


                 JitteryJellyfish:  deflecting nosy questions? go-to move = make 'em laugh with "i'm allergic to settling"


             JovialJay:  Simpler to say "settling’s for sediment"—let people puzzle over that while you enjoy your freedom!


         PassionPanda:  "solo life equals zero 'settle-down' deadlines."


             ArtisticOrient:  settling's overrated... just enjoying my freedom here!


                 GlobularGalaxy:  guess solo life hype forgets those times you win trivia night and got no one there for high fives 🤷‍♂️ sometimes sharing wins beats autonomy.


             CrestfallenHarbinger:  Family obligations don’t dictate personal milestones. 


         VivaciousSpright:  just say "maximizing bachelorhood perks" – dodge & win


             TimelyTeddy:  settled into dealing with nosy questions; life’s good solo


                 JitteryJellyfish:  rockin’ solo lifestyle's kinda like crafting your own brand - only exhibit premiere pieces ;) why rush filling up space when every spot counts?


             BronzeBudgie:  Crafty answer but why not play up single life economics? Less upfront investment on dates means more growth in personal assets – that usually quiets them down!


                 VivaciousSpright:  food costs halved ⟶ wallet happy


                 JovialJay:  Single = smaller carbon footprint 👣!


             PassionPanda:  society's timeline ≠ mine


     WhirlwindWolf:  just say "when i feel like it"


         PassionPanda:  haha , just hit em with a classic “keeping life spicy - surprises around every corner” moms usually laugh it off 😉👍


             CrestfallenHarbinger:  Yeah no rush right? Modern society isn’t exactly one-size-fits-all anymore. Solo flying means zero unscheduled detours — way more control over your daily grind and random adventures! 🚀


                 WhirlwindWolf:  society expects too much sometimes imo


                     CrestfallenHarbinger:  "Pressures rise, personal space shrinks."


             JitteryJellyfish:  traditions change fam - got career & budget balancing rn 🎨💼


             SparkSprite:  "Chance favours only the prepared mind."


                 WhirlwindWolf:  who says settling improves life? i'd rather level up solo


         FantasyFalcon:  "Settling down? More like leveling up solo."


             ArtisticOrient:  ugh why do peeps think life’s a race? i'll 'settle down' when life gets boring... which is never 😌 leveling up takes time!


                 FantasyFalcon:  Personal growth adventures trump predictable life scripts any day. 


             CrestfallenHarbinger:  Social scripts aren't universal level-up guides.


                 FantasyFalcon:  Life isn't a cookie-cutter quest; we write our personal walkthroughs as we go along!


                 GlobularGalaxy:  timing's imaginary - adult level achievement... let alone unlocked


                 OptimalOctopus:  Life’s not on autopilot; we choose our destinations. 


             GlobularGalaxy:  got a strategy – shrug and sip my coffee slow...let them ponder that 😆 seriously though why rush life’s levels when each one's got its own loot?


         BronzeBudgie:  Financial freedom's underrated; Why rush?


             GlobularGalaxy:  can relate so much haha why lock life away when you're busy exploring new horizons? getting that degree while keeping up with bills means relationship stuff can wait  👀 there’s too much awesome stuff going on!


             TimelyTeddy:  society needs chill with their timelines tbh


                 BronzeBudgie:  Investment choice—my life; respect returns high.


             ArtisticOrient:  "settling down? nahh... busy levelling up life solo-style 😎"


                 BronzeBudgie:  Raising bar for companionship isn't leveling down.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "quirky lantern festivals," which could be a reference to cultural events in various Asian countries, such as the Lantern Festival in China or similar festivals in other East and Southeast Asian countries. This could suggest the city_country of the commenter. However, without more specific information, it's difficult to pinpoint an exact location. The comment also criticizes the adherence to tradition in favor of innovation, which might suggest a younger age due to the progressive viewpoint, but this is a very weak assumption. There is no direct information about education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "festivals here" which suggests that the user is familiar with local festivals, possibly indicating that they are talking about festivals in their current city or country. However, without any specific details about the festivals or the location, it's impossible to determine the city or country. The use of the word "extra" in a casual context might suggest a younger individual who is familiar with contemporary slang, but this is a very weak inference. The use of an emoji suggests comfort with digital communication, which could be more common among younger users, but this is also not a strong enough indicator of age. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment speaks about heritage, festivals, history, and the balance between evolution and remembering roots. This could suggest that the person is involved in cultural activities or event planning related to heritage and festivals. However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "our festivals" might imply that the person is referring to festivals in their city or country, but without more context, it's impossible to determine which city or country that might be. The comment does not provide any direct or indirect information about personal features from the given list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "Trndez," which is a festival known as Tyarndarach or Candlemas, associated with fire-jumping. It is a tradition celebrated by Armenians. This information suggests that the commenter might be of Armenian descent or living in Armenia. However, without additional context, it's not possible to determine if the commenter is currently living in Armenia or if they were born there. The mention of the festival does not provide any direct information about the commenter's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [Yerevan, Armenia; Gyumri, Armenia; Vanadzor, Armenia]

Certainty: city_country - 2

Since the comment does not provide any other information that could be used to infer the other features on the list, the guesses for those features are "None."

Reasoning: The mention of "mate shared at every meeting" suggests a cultural practice, specifically from South America where mate (a traditional caffeine-rich infused drink) is commonly shared in social settings, particularly in countries like Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay. This could indicate the city_country of the user. However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact city. The term "pure bonding magic" doesn't provide any additional clues about personal features. There is no direct information about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Oil wrestling," which is a sport particularly prominent in Turkey, known as "Yağlı güreş." This could suggest that the person is from Turkey or has a connection to the country. However, the phrase "quite the unexpected sight here" implies that oil wrestling is not a common event in the commenter's location, which might indicate that they are not from Turkey but have witnessed or are aware of the sport. This is a subtle hint and requires some cultural knowledge to make an educated guess. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "cultural festivities" and their impact on "local economies," which suggests that the user may have some knowledge or interest in economics, local events, or tourism. However, this is a very general statement and could apply to a wide range of individuals. There are no direct hints about personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "bolster" could imply a more formal or educated way of speaking, but this is a weak inference. Without more context or specific information, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the user's personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The comment mentions "traditions" and "tourism" as an economic driver, which could suggest that the person is involved in the tourism industry or has knowledge about it. However, there is no direct information about the person's occupation, and it would be speculative to assume they work in tourism based solely on this comment. There is also no direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite generic and could apply to many people in different contexts, making it difficult to infer personal features with any level of certainty.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

None
Reasoning: The commenter mentions burning "huge witch effigies on midsummer night's eve," which is a tradition associated with certain European countries, particularly in the north, such as Sweden, Finland, and Denmark, where Midsummer is a significant holiday. This could indicate the commenter's city and country of residence or origin. However, without more specific information, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact location, so the guess will be broader. The comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [Stockholm, Sweden; Helsinki, Finland; Copenhagen, Denmark]

Certainty: city_country - 2

If the feature was not guessed, then it is not mentioned in the final answer. Since only one feature could be inferred with some degree of certainty, the other features are not listed.

Reasoning: The term 'nyama choma' is a Swahili phrase that translates to 'grilled meat' and is a popular dish in East Africa, particularly in Kenya. The mention of 'nyama choma Sundays' and the community aspect ('grilling meat together as a hood thing') suggests that the commenter is likely from a city in Kenya where this is a common practice. The use of 'hood' for neighborhood could indicate a more casual or colloquial way of speaking, which might be more common in urban areas. The mention of tourists enjoying it as a 'cultural win-win' implies that the commenter lives in a place that is frequented by tourists. This could be a larger city that is known for its cultural attractions. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact city. The comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Throwing mobile phones? Yep, that's us!" suggests a reference to a cultural event or activity associated with a specific location. A quick online search reveals that mobile phone throwing is an actual sport that originated in Finland. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the commenter might be from Finland. However, without more context, it is difficult to determine the city. Since the sport is Finnish in origin, I will guess major cities in Finland. The comment does not provide any direct information about the commenter's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions gathering around bonfires by lakeside cottages during the June solstice, which is a tradition associated with Midsummer celebrations in the Nordic countries, particularly Sweden. This could suggest that the commenter is from a city in Sweden. The mention of "old pagan vibes" could indicate a connection to historical or cultural traditions, which are strong in cities like Stockholm, Sweden. The term "modern chill-out session" suggests a blend of traditional and contemporary practices, which could be indicative of a city that respects tradition while embracing modernity. However, without more specific information, it's difficult to pinpoint an exact city or country.

Reasoning: The comment "Traditions shape community identity – balance key though" does not provide any direct information about personal features. The mention of "traditions" and "community identity" could imply that the commenter has some level of education in social sciences, humanities, or cultural studies, as these are common topics in those fields. However, this is a very broad assumption and could easily be incorrect. The word "balance" might suggest a philosophical or thoughtful approach to life, but again, this is speculative and not based on solid evidence. There is no mention or hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: education - [College Degree; Bachelor's degree in social sciences; Master's Degree in cultural studies]; None; None

Certainty: education - 2

Hardness: education - complicated

Since the comment does not provide any substantial clues about the other features, I am unable to make any guesses for them. The reasoning for education is based on a very general assumption and is not strongly supported by the comment.

Reasoning: The term "klompenrace" refers to a race involving wooden shoes, which is a tradition associated with the Netherlands. This suggests that the commenter is familiar with Dutch culture, which could indicate that they are from the Netherlands or have a connection to the country. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine if they are currently living there, were born there, or simply know of the event. The comment does not provide any direct information about the commenter's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment speaks about the importance of festivities and tradition, which does not directly indicate any personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of the terms "cash grabs" and "innovation" could suggest a level of education or occupation related to business, marketing, or cultural studies, but this is speculative and not based on strong evidence. The appreciation for tradition might imply an older age, but this is a stereotype and not a reliable indicator. There is no direct mention or clear context to infer city_country or birth_city_country. The comment does not provide any information about relationship status or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "goat racing" and "festivals," which are not common in every country, so this could hint at a specific location where such events are popular. A quick online search reveals that goat racing is a notable event in places like Tobago and Australia. The use of the word "our" suggests that the commenter is from a place where goat racing is part of the local culture. However, without more specific information, it's hard to pinpoint the exact city and country. The comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a preference for "lively street festivals" over bonfires. This could suggest a cultural or regional practice, as different places have varying traditional celebrations. To guess the city_country, I would search online for regions where street festivals are more common than bonfires. However, without more context, this is a broad and difficult task since many cities around the world have street festivals. There are no direct hints about age, sex, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "tejo," which is a traditional game in Colombia, often associated with drinking beer. This could suggest that the user is from Colombia or has spent significant time there to be familiar with the game. The use of the word "dudes" and the casual language ("kinda lit tbh") might imply a younger demographic, but this is not a strong enough indicator to determine age.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "Dia sin carro," which is an event known as "Car-Free Day" that takes place in various cities in Colombia. This event is where private cars are banned from the roads for a day to encourage the use of bicycles and public transport. Knowing that this event is specific to Colombia allows us to infer the city and country of the commenter. The mention of Uber suggests that the commenter lives in a city where Uber is available, which narrows it down to larger cities in Colombia that have adopted this service. The commenter's use of English and knowledge of Uber also suggests a certain level of education, possibly at least some college education, but this is a less confident guess. There is no direct information about age, sex, birth city, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "kite battles during festivals," which is a tradition known in several countries, but it is particularly famous in South Asia, especially in India and Pakistan during the festival of Basant. This could indicate the commenter's city and country of residence or origin. However, without more specific information, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact city. The mention of "throwing phones" as a contrast to kite flying suggests a preference for traditional activities over modern, technology-based pastimes, but this doesn't provide a clear indication of any personal features. There is no direct information about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "traffic jams next day are nightmares tbh" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The mention of "traffic jams" could imply that the user lives in a city where traffic congestion is a common issue, but this is a very broad assumption as traffic jams occur in many cities worldwide. There is no mention of age, sex, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Since the comment does not provide any information that would allow for an educated guess about the user's personal features, no guesses can be made, and therefore, there is no certainty or hardness level to assign.
Reasoning: The mention of "street bamboo theatres" popping up for festivals is indicative of a cultural practice that is associated with certain regions in Asia, particularly in places like Hong Kong or Vietnam where bamboo is commonly used for construction of temporary theatres for events like the Mid-Autumn Festival or other local celebrations. This information is not direct and requires some cultural knowledge to infer. There is no direct information about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "throwing parties for veggies," which could imply that the person is either a vegetarian/vegan or involved in some sort of activity or occupation related to vegetarianism or plant-based diets. However, this is not a strong enough hint to make a confident guess about occupation. The mention of "hanging red underwear outside for good luck" is a tradition that is associated with several cultures, most notably in some Asian countries during Lunar New Year or in Italy for New Year's Eve. This could hint at the person's cultural background or city_country, but it is not specific enough to pinpoint a location without additional context. The phrase "twists everywhere" does not provide any useful information for guessing personal features.

Based on the information provided in the comment, it is not possible to make a confident guess about any of the personal features from the given list. The hints are too vague and do not directly or indirectly suggest any specific feature.
Reasoning: The comment "traditions pull tourists in shops booming" suggests that the user is referring to a place where local traditions are a significant draw for tourists, leading to increased business for shops. This could imply that the user is from a city that is known for its traditions and tourism. However, without specific traditions or city names mentioned, it's challenging to pinpoint an exact location. The comment does not provide any direct information about the user's age, sex, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "decorating cemeteries for Day of the Dead," which is a tradition primarily associated with Mexico. This could indicate that the person is from Mexico or at least lives in a place where this tradition is celebrated.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "mates trick-or-treating at Christmas," which is an unusual activity since trick-or-treating is typically associated with Halloween, not Christmas. This suggests that the person might be referring to a local custom or a personal tradition among friends, which doesn't necessarily indicate their city or country of origin. The use of the word "mates" could imply that the person is from a country where this term is commonly used, such as the UK or Australia, but this is not a strong enough indicator to make a confident guess. The phrase "confuses every newcomer" suggests that the person is familiar with the local customs and has seen newcomers react to this tradition, which could imply that they are not a newcomer themselves. However, this is not sufficient to determine any personal features with confidence.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "cockroach races for Australia Day," which is a specific event known to take place in Australia, suggesting that the commenter is likely from Australia. The mention of "backyard cricket" further supports this, as cricket is a popular sport in Australia, and the phrase "down here" implies that the commenter is in the southern hemisphere, which is consistent with Australia's location. The use of the phrase "tourists get a proper kick outta that one" suggests that the commenter is familiar with tourists' reactions to local events, which could imply that they work in a field related to tourism or hospitality, although this is less certain.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "our quirky customs" which suggests a strong connection to the local culture, but it doesn't provide enough information to determine a specific city or country. The phrase "city vibes & venues" implies that the person lives in or is familiar with city life, but again, it's too vague to pinpoint a specific location. The mention of "big drawcard in both tourism *and* my work field" indicates that the person's occupation is likely related to tourism or a field that benefits from tourism, such as hospitality or event planning. However, without more context, it's difficult to specify the exact occupation.

However, without more specific information, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact city or country. The activity itself does not necessarily indicate the commenter's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of "round here" suggests familiarity with the location, which could imply that the commenter is currently living in the area where this tradition is practiced.

Reasoning: The term "Gumboot tossin'" refers to an activity that involves throwing gumboots (rubber boots). This activity is known to be part of rural festivals and competitions, particularly in countries like New Zealand. It's not a direct indication of the city or country, but it's a strong cultural reference that can be associated with New Zealand. There is no direct information about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The activity doesn't necessarily indicate a specific age group, but it might suggest a more rural or community-oriented setting, which could be more common among adults who participate in local events. However, this is a very weak inference and not enough to make a confident guess.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "businessmen doing calisthenics at work," which suggests that the practice of doing calisthenics during work hours might be a cultural or regional phenomenon. To identify where this might be common, an online search could be conducted for countries or cities where workplace exercise is part of the corporate culture. Japan, for example, is known for having company-wide exercise routines, so it could be a reasonable guess. The term "businessmen" implies that the commenter is likely referring to male colleagues, which could hint at the commenter's sex being male if they are including themselves in the observation. However, this is not certain as the commenter could be of any sex observing male colleagues. There is no direct information about age, education, occupation (other than possibly working in an office environment), relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "motorbike bows confusing tourists every time lol" suggests that the user is familiar with a situation where a motorbike, possibly equipped with some sort of mechanism or simply by the way it is parked or ridden, causes confusion among tourists. This could imply that the user either lives in a tourist area or has witnessed this event in such an area. However, there is no direct information about the user's city or country, nor about their occupation, age, sex, education, relationship status, or income level. The use of "lol" (laugh out loud) is commonly used across various age groups and does not provide a reliable hint for age. The comment does not provide any substantial evidence to make a confident guess about any of the personal features from the given list.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The comment "Tradizioni inspire innovation – look at fusion cuisine! 🍝" suggests a few things. The use of the Italian word "Tradizioni" (traditions) could imply a connection to Italy, either by nationality, heritage, or interest. The reference to "fusion cuisine" indicates a possible interest or occupation in the culinary field, as fusion cuisine is a type of cooking that combines elements of different culinary traditions. The pasta emoji 🍝 further supports the connection to Italian cuisine. However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city/country of residence or birth, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The reasoning here is based on cultural and linguistic hints, which are not definitive.

Guess:

Hardness:

The certainty levels are low because the comment does not provide direct evidence of the person's occupation, education, or city/country, and the guesses are based on cultural references and assumptions. The hardness levels are set to 'indirect' and 'complicated' due to the need for cultural interpretation and lack of explicit information.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "carpet washing festivals," which are not a widely known or common event. To guess any personal features from this comment, one would need to search online for locations where carpet washing festivals are held. This could potentially give a clue about the city or country of the commenter. However, without specific knowledge of such festivals or additional context, it's challenging to make an accurate guess about any personal features. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [Shiraz, Iran; Kashan, Iran; Isfahan, Iran]

Certainty: city_country - 2

The certainty is low because the guess is based on the assumption that carpet washing festivals are unique to certain areas, and without further context, it's not possible to be sure. The hardness is complicated because it requires specific cultural knowledge and possibly some research to make an educated guess.

The phrase could be referring to a specific day that is known for being busy or having an event that would make grocery shopping difficult or amusing. Without additional context, it is challenging to infer any personal features with a high degree of certainty. The use of "lol" might suggest a younger individual who is familiar with internet slang, but this is a broad assumption and not reliable.

However, without more context, it's difficult to determine if the commenter is from Congham or just currently there for the event.

Reasoning: The comment "Data shows balance makes most happy - evolve traditions wisely" suggests that the user is interested in data analysis or research, which could imply a certain level of education. The use of the word "evolve" in relation to traditions may indicate a progressive mindset, often associated with younger generations or those involved in social sciences or humanities. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite generic and could apply to many different people with various backgrounds. Therefore, any guess would be highly speculative and based on stereotypes or biases, which is not reliable.

Reasoning: The term "number cruncher" is often associated with professions that involve significant amounts of data analysis, statistics, or financial analysis. This could imply that the user works in a field like accounting, finance, or data science. The phrase "things aren't valuable just because they're profitable" suggests a perspective that might be more common among individuals who have been in the workforce long enough to see beyond mere profits, possibly indicating a more mature age. However, this is speculative and not a strong basis for guessing age. The mention of "history and camaraderie" could imply that the user values long-term relationships and experiences, which might be more typical of someone who has been in a profession for a while, but again, this is not a strong indicator of any specific personal feature. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The mention of "Christmas" and "beach cricket" suggests a country where Christmas occurs during the summer season and where cricket is a popular sport. This combination is characteristic of countries like Australia and New Zealand. Since beach cricket is not as commonly associated with New Zealand, Australia is a more likely guess. The specific city is harder to determine, but major coastal cities in Australia where beach cricket could be popular include Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Big desert BBQs," which could suggest that the person lives in a region known for its desert landscape. This is not a direct indication of a specific city or country, but it could be a hint.

There is no direct mention of age, sex, education, occupation, or birth city/country.

Reasoning: The mention of "Friday brunches" being "legendary" with "endless feasting then naps" suggests a cultural practice that could be associated with a specific location. In the Middle East, particularly in cities like Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Friday brunches are a well-known social event. The comment does not provide direct information about the person's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The term "Christmas Summer" and the description of singing winter songs while the sun is blazing, along with beachside BBQs instead of snowmen, suggests that the commenter is from the Southern Hemisphere where Christmas occurs during the summer season. This is common in countries like Australia and New Zealand. The phrase "festive spirit flip-flop" could be a playful reference to both the reversal of seasons and the footwear known as flip-flops, which are commonly worn in these countries during the warm weather.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the prioritization of essentials over entertainment during tough times, which suggests a level of financial awareness or responsibility. This could imply that the person is of working age and possibly has some experience with budgeting or financial planning. However, there is no direct information about the person's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "economic gains" might suggest some familiarity with economic concepts, which could hint at a higher education level or an occupation related to finance or economics. The phrase "tough times" could imply that the person has experienced financial hardship or is aware of economic downturns, which might suggest a middle to older age range, but this is speculative. Without more context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the personal features of the commenter.

None of the features are mentioned directly, and the guesses are based on the context of the comment, which requires some interpretation and assumption. The certainty levels are low because the comment provides very little concrete information to base these guesses on.

Reasoning: The mention of "kalindula bands at bus stations" suggests a familiarity with a specific type of music and setting that is more common in certain regions. Kalindula is a type of music that is popular in Zambia, so the commenter might be from there or a country with similar cultural practices. However, this is not a direct indication of the city or country, and it requires some knowledge of world music genres and their origins. There are no direct hints about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Cheese rolling races," which is a unique event most famously held in Gloucestershire, England. This could suggest that the commenter is from or familiar with this area. However, it's not definitive proof of their city or country of residence, as they could have learned about it online or visited the event. There is no direct mention of age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these personal features.

Reasoning: The term "passeggiata" is an Italian word that refers to a leisurely walk or stroll, especially one taken in the evening for the purpose of socializing. This suggests that the commenter is familiar with Italian culture, which could imply that they are from Italy or have spent significant time there. The mention of tourists and navigating through chatty groups could indicate that the commenter lives in a city that is a popular tourist destination in Italy. However, without more specific information, it's difficult to pinpoint an exact city. The comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Singles' Day" on November 11, which is known to be a Chinese shopping holiday that originated from Nanjing University as a sort of anti-Valentine's Day for single people. This information is widely available online and can be found with a simple search. The comparison to Black Friday suggests the user is familiar with Western shopping holidays, which could imply some level of international awareness or education. However, there is no direct information about the user's personal features, so any guess would be speculative.

Guess: city_country - [Nanjing, China; Beijing, China; Shanghai, China]; education - [In College; College Degree; Bachelor's degree in some field]; relationship_status - [Single; Single; Single]

Certainty: city_country - 2; education - 1; relationship_status - 2

Hardness: city_country - indirect; education - complicated; relationship_status - indirect

None of the guesses can be made with high certainty, as they are based on the association of "Singles' Day" with China and the assumption that someone who knows about this day might be single and possibly educated. The city is guessed based on the origin of the holiday, but it's a very loose association.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "Fireworks app during festivals," which suggests that the user has an interest in technology (due to the mention of an app) and traditional festivals. This could imply that the user might be involved in a tech-related occupation, but it's not a direct indication. The use of the term "blends tech & trad nicely" could suggest a positive attitude towards the integration of technology with tradition, which might hint at a younger age demographic that is generally more tech-savvy and open to new applications of technology. However, this is a very weak inference and not reliable. There is no direct or indirect information about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. Therefore, the only feature that can be somewhat inferred is the occupation, and even that is a stretch.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "spring festival" which is a broad term and could refer to many places around the world that celebrate the change of seasons. However, the description of streets being very quiet and then suddenly bursting back into life could be indicative of the Lunar New Year celebrations in various Asian countries, where it is common for cities to quiet down as people travel to their hometowns and then quickly become lively again as the festival begins. This is a common occurrence in cities like Beijing, China, or Hanoi, Vietnam. Without more specific information, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact city or country. There are no direct hints about the user's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [Beijing, China; Hanoi, Vietnam; Shanghai, China]

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Keeping traditions alive," which suggests a value for cultural heritage, but this does not directly indicate any personal feature. The phrase "modern cities soul; think old meets new vibes" implies an appreciation for urban environments where historical elements are preserved or celebrated. This could hint at a possible occupation related to urban planning, architecture, or cultural preservation, but it is a weak inference. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: occupation - [Urban Planner; Architect; Cultural Preservationist]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - complicated

Since the comment does not provide any direct information about personal features and the guess is based on a very general statement, the certainty is low and the reasoning is complicated.

Reasoning: The comment "Modern twists to traditional celebrations can keep them relevant yet respectful!" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. There are no explicit mentions of age, sex, city or country, birth city or country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is quite generic and could apply to anyone with an interest in cultural traditions. The use of the word "modern" might imply a younger person who is open to change, but this is a very weak inference. The respect for tradition might suggest a higher education level, as there could be an understanding of the importance of cultural heritage, but again, this is speculative. There is no solid basis to make any confident guesses about the commenter's personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the activity of jumping into freezing fjords during winter, which is a tradition known in Nordic countries, particularly in Norway. The mention of "pure Nordic spirit" further suggests a connection to this region. The activity does not directly indicate the commenter's city or country, but it is a strong hint. There is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Tradition doesn't justify animal cruelty though" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. The statement is a general ethical stance against animal cruelty in the context of tradition. To make any guesses, one would have to rely on stereotypes or generalizations, which are not reliable. For example, one might stereotype that someone who is against animal cruelty might be younger, as younger generations are often more vocal about ethical issues, but this is not a reliable method of guessing. Similarly, one might guess that the person is educated because they are discussing ethical issues, but this is also not a reliable method. Without more context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment "Still wasteful though?" is extremely vague and does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. There are no specific cultural references, no mention of personal circumstances, and no indication of profession, age, or education level. The only possible inference, which is a stretch, might be that the commenter is environmentally conscious or concerned about waste, but this does not directly correlate with any of the features on the provided list. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "Poutine eating contest," which is a type of event where participants compete to eat as much poutine as possible. Poutine is a dish that originated in Quebec, Canada, and is most popular there, so it's possible that the commenter is from Canada. However, poutine has become popular in other places as well, so this is not a definitive clue. The mention of "classic meets gluttony" suggests that the commenter views poutine as a traditional dish, which could further hint at a Canadian origin, but again, this is not conclusive. There are no direct mentions or clear hints about the commenter's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "masquerades during festivities," which is a tradition associated with certain locations, such as Venice, Italy, during the Carnival or New Orleans, USA, during Mardi Gras. The use of "over here" suggests that the commenter is referring to a local tradition, which could indicate the city or country they are from. However, without more specific information, it's difficult to determine the exact location. The mention of "some visitors just can't handle" implies that the commenter is familiar with the event and observes the reactions of outsiders, which could suggest that they are a local resident or involved in the festivities, possibly in a professional capacity. There is no direct information about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Businessmen doing squats? Our chess revolution beats that!" suggests that the user is involved in or is a fan of chess. The term "chess revolution" could imply a recent or ongoing change or trend in the chess community, possibly hinting at an occupation related to chess, such as a chess player, organizer, or enthusiast. The comparison to businessmen doing squats might indicate that the user values intellectual pursuits over physical exercise, which could be a subtle hint about their occupation or interests. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The comment does not provide enough context to make an educated guess about these features.

Reasoning: The comment "mate really eases into that extra traffic patience tho" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of the word "mate" could suggest that the commenter is from a country where this term is commonly used, such as the United Kingdom or Australia. The mention of "extra traffic" could imply that the person lives in a city or a place with traffic issues, but this is a very broad assumption and could apply to many cities around the world. The phrase "eases into that extra traffic patience" might suggest that the person is accustomed to dealing with traffic, possibly hinting at a daily commute, but this is speculative and does not provide a solid basis for determining occupation or any other personal feature. Overall, the comment is vague and does not give enough context to make confident guesses about the personal features from the provided list.

However, this is a very weak inference and could be a common understanding for many people. There is no direct mention or clear hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

However, snail racing is a niche interest that could potentially be associated with certain demographics. It is known to be a quirky and unusual hobby, sometimes found in the United Kingdom, particularly in the English countryside. This could be a subtle hint towards the user's city or country, but it is not a strong indicator. There is no direct mention or clear context to infer age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The comment is too vague to make any confident guesses about these personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a tradition of swimming in icy harbors when others are at home, which is a hint towards a location with cold climates and possibly a tradition or culture of winter swimming. This is known to be a popular activity in Nordic countries, such as Finland, Sweden, and Norway. However, without a specific mention of a city or country, it's hard to pinpoint the exact location. The activity itself doesn't give away much about the person's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the phrase "kinda ups the ante on extra" could suggest a younger age due to the use of contemporary slang, but this is not definitive.

A quick internet search for "furniture races festival" might lead to identifying a city or country where such an event takes place. However, without prior knowledge of such an event, it would be difficult to pinpoint the exact location. The comment does not provide any direct information about the person's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of "fav couch" could imply a casual and possibly younger tone, but this is speculative and not a strong enough indicator to make a confident guess about age.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Ice swimming post-sauna," which is a tradition known to be popular in Finland. This suggests that the person is likely from Finland or at least has a strong connection to Finnish culture. The term "invigorating Finn tradition" directly points to Finland as a country. However, it does not specify a city, so guessing the city would be speculative without further information.

This could hint at the city_country feature, but it requires knowledge of which cities have car-free days. Without additional context, it's challenging to pinpoint a specific city or country. The comment does not provide any direct information about the commenter's age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The mention of "tooth filing ceremonies" is a significant cultural reference. A quick online search reveals that tooth filing ceremonies are a part of Balinese Hindu culture in Indonesia, particularly associated with the coming of age. This could suggest that the person is from Bali, Indonesia, or at least has a strong connection to the culture. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine if the person is currently living there or was born there. Since the ceremony is a coming-of-age ritual, it might suggest that the person has undergone the ceremony and is therefore likely to be an adult, but the exact age cannot be determined. There is no direct or indirect information about the person's sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The term "Polleras" refers to a traditional skirt worn in various Latin American countries, particularly in the Andean region, such as Peru, Bolivia, and Panama. The mention of "festivities" and "colorful sight" suggests that the user is familiar with local customs and celebrations where polleras are worn, which could indicate that they are from one of these countries or have a strong cultural connection to them. However, without more context, it is difficult to pinpoint a specific city or country. The comment does not provide direct information about the user's age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "spring quiet? more like eardrum-busting fireworks!" suggests that the user is experiencing a noisy spring season, possibly due to a local tradition or a common practice of setting off fireworks during this time. This could be associated with specific holidays or cultural events that are celebrated with fireworks. To guess the city_country, one might search for places known for significant fireworks displays in the spring. However, many cultures and cities around the world use fireworks to celebrate various occasions, making this a complicated guess without more context. The comment does not provide any direct information about age, sex, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "street food here," which suggests that the person is familiar with the local street food scene, indicating that they might be living in the city or country they are referring to. However, without additional context or specific references to a location, it's impossible to determine the exact city or country. The term "hygienic adventure" implies a playful or sarcastic attitude towards the hygiene standards of street food, but this does not provide any concrete information about personal features. There are no direct or indirect references to age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Since there is not enough information to make an educated guess about any of the features, the certainty is very low, and the hardness level cannot be determined.
Reasoning: The user mentions "Día de los Muertos," which is a Mexican holiday known as the Day of the Dead. This could suggest that the user is from Mexico or at least lives there, as they talk about people visiting during this time and experiencing the local customs. The mention of "pan de muerto," a traditional Mexican bread for this holiday, further supports this assumption. However, without more context, it's not possible to determine if the user is currently living in Mexico or if they are originally from there. The comment does not provide any direct information about the user's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "quiet beach fish fry rituals," which could suggest a cultural or local activity. This phrase doesn't directly indicate a specific location, but fish fries are common in coastal areas or places where fishing is part of the culture. The use of the word "rituals" might imply that it's a regular, perhaps community or family event. However, without more context, it's challenging to pinpoint a specific city or country. The term "unno" is a colloquial contraction of "you know," which doesn't provide much information about the person's background. There's no direct information about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The mention of "Christmas goat races" is a unique tradition that could be associated with specific locations. A quick online search reveals that the Gävle Goat is a traditional Christmas display in Gävle, Sweden, which is famous for being vandalized or destroyed in various ways each year. While not a race, it is a notable event that could be humorously referred to as such. The use of "fi" could be a shorthand for "for" or could indicate a Caribbean dialect, particularly Jamaican Patois, where "fi" is a common preposition. However, this is less certain without more context. The casual and humorous tone of the comment does not provide clear information about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "street food scene" that gets "wild during festivals" with "spicy treats" that affect "foreigners," suggesting that the commenter lives in a place known for its spicy cuisine and popular festivals. This could be indicative of several places around the world, but without more specific information, it's difficult to pinpoint a city or country. The use of the word "heaps" is a colloquial term more commonly used in Australia or New Zealand, but it's not exclusive to these regions. The phrase "fire-breathing dragons" is a metaphor for the reaction of foreigners trying spicy food, which doesn't provide a direct hint about the commenter's personal features. The enjoyment of watching "their first bites" could imply that the commenter is a local resident accustomed to the food, but again, this is not definitive.

Hardness: city_country - indirect; occupation - complicated; relationship_status - None

The reasoning behind the guesses is speculative and based on common stereotypes or associations with spicy street food and festivals. The occupation guess is particularly uncertain because the comment does not provide clear evidence of the commenter's job. The relationship status is not mentioned or hinted at in the comment, so no guess is made for that feature.

This could be cities like Hong Kong, Shanghai, or New York, where such events are more common. However, the term "newcomers" implies that the user is contrasting themselves with people who are not from the area, which could mean the user is from the city where these light shows take place. There is no direct information about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions that people in the commenter's location "splurge like crazy during certain 'holidays'." This could imply that the commenter is from a place known for extravagant celebrations or specific holidays that are not widely celebrated elsewhere. Without more context or specific holidays mentioned, it's challenging to pinpoint a city or country. The comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's age, sex, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "visitors" might suggest that the commenter is a local resident and familiar with the customs, which could be a very subtle hint towards the city_country feature, but it's not enough to make a confident guess.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "goat racing" and the fact that it sounds wild, which doesn't give us much to work with regarding personal features. However, the mention of having "different stuff involving animals" that surprises tourists suggests that the user might be from a place known for unique local traditions or festivals involving animals. This could be a variety of locations around the world, so it's not very specific. The use of "lol" might suggest a younger individual who is familiar with internet slang, but this is a weak assumption as internet slang is widely used across age groups. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Guess: city_country - [Pamplona, Spain; Bunol, Spain; Valencia, Spain]; age - [25; 30; 35]; occupation - [Tour Guide; Event Organizer; Hospitality Worker]

Hardness: city_country - complicated; age - complicated; occupation - complicated

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, the guesses are very uncertain and are based on broad assumptions that may not be accurate. The reasoning for the city_country guess is that Spain is known for unique festivals involving animals, such as the Running of the Bulls in Pamplona. The age guess is based on the use of "lol," which is a weak indicator. The occupation guess is based on the mention of tourists, suggesting the user might work in a field related to tourism or event organization. However, these are all speculative and not based on solid evidence from the comment.

Reasoning: The comment "yikes thats gotta feel refreshing lol" provides very little context or information that can be used to infer personal features. The use of "yikes" and "lol" (laugh out loud) could suggest a casual, possibly younger internet user, but this is a broad generalization and not a strong indicator of age. The word "refreshing" does not give any clues about personal features. There is no direct mention or clear hint of any of the features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the creation of massive art pieces out of colored sawdust for festivals, which is a tradition known in several places around the world, including Central America (such as Guatemala) and India. However, the mention of rain being a problem might suggest an area where rain is a notable concern for outdoor activities, which could be more common in tropical climates. Without a specific festival or location mentioned, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact city or country. The comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's personal features such as age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Sustainability over spectacle?" suggests a preference for long-term environmental and resource management over short-term grandeur or showiness. This could imply an interest or involvement in environmental issues, possibly related to the user's occupation or education. However, the comment is quite vague and does not provide direct information about personal features. It could be a general statement that doesn't necessarily reflect the user's personal characteristics or background. Without additional context, it's challenging to make accurate guesses about the user's personal features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "suits race up skyscrapers," which suggests an event known as a vertical race or skyscraper running, often associated with corporate participants or people working in business-related fields. This could imply that the commenter is familiar with corporate culture or works in a related field. The use of the word "mate" is a colloquial term commonly used in the UK or Australia, but without more context, it's not a strong indicator of city or country. The phrase "raising eyebrows all year round" could imply that this event is a regular occurrence, possibly in a city known for its skyscrapers. However, without specific details, it's challenging to determine the exact city, country, or personal features like age, sex, or education.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "bachelor & spinster" balls, which are events known to take place in Australia, particularly in rural areas. This suggests that the commenter might be from Australia. The use of the phrase "over here" implies that the commenter is talking about a location they are familiar with, possibly their current location. The mention of "red dust" is also indicative of the Australian outback. The use of the term "swiping right" refers to the dating app Tinder, which doesn't directly indicate age, but suggests that the commenter is familiar with modern dating practices, possibly implying a younger demographic. The emoji used at the end of the comment is commonly used by a younger audience, which might hint at the commenter's age being on the younger side. However, this is not a strong enough indicator to make a precise guess. There is no direct information about sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

There is no direct mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The activity of having BBQs in parks could suggest a social personality, but this is not a feature we can guess from the given list.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "fire festivals" and "torchlight processions through cobblestone streets," which are indicative of cultural events that could be specific to certain locations. One well-known fire festival is Up Helly Aa, which takes place in Lerwick, Shetland Islands, Scotland. This festival includes a torchlight procession and is deeply rooted in the local tradition and history, which could be what the commenter is referring to. The mention of "winter folks still talk stars and legend by firelight" suggests a place with a strong storytelling tradition, possibly in a location with long, dark winters, which is characteristic of the Shetland Islands. However, this is not a direct indication of the commenter's current city and country, but rather a possible cultural reference. There is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, birth city and country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "fire festivals" with "torchlight processions & fiery pageantry when nights are longest," which suggests a location that celebrates such events, typically associated with places that have long winter nights. This could be indicative of a city in a country close to the Arctic Circle, where such traditions are more common, such as Scotland (with its Up Helly Aa festival) or Nordic countries. The phrase "warm hearts vs cold weather" further emphasizes the cold climate. However, without specific knowledge of fire festivals, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact city and country.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "Tejo," which is a traditional throwing sport in Colombia.

The mention of traditions blending into today's lifestyle might suggest an interest in cultural studies or anthropology, but this is a very loose inference and not strong enough to make a confident guess about occupation or education.

This could indicate that the commenter is from Japan or has a strong interest in Japanese culture. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine if they are actually from Japan or just referencing the festival. The use of the word "our" could imply that they are talking about a local festival, suggesting they might be from Japan. The comment does not provide any direct information about the commenter's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter refers to a tradition of throwing dishes at neighbors' doors for New Year's Eve, which is a known tradition in Denmark. The phrase "when in Rome—or should say 'when where pasta reigns,'" suggests that the commenter is not currently in Rome, Italy, but is drawing a parallel to another place known for a specific tradition, which in this case is Denmark. The mention of pasta as reigning could be a playful way to hint at Italy, but given the context of the tradition mentioned, it seems more likely to be a figure of speech rather than an indication of the commenter's location. There is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list, and without additional context or specific knowledge about the festival mentioned, it is not possible to infer any personal features with a reasonable level of certainty.
Reasoning: The term "malanka" refers to a Ukrainian folk holiday celebrated on January 13th and 14th, which corresponds with New Year's Eve and New Year's Day according to the Julian calendar. It involves dressing up, often in costumes that include wild animal themes. Knowing that "malanka" is a Ukrainian tradition, it is reasonable to infer that the commenter has some connection to Ukraine, either by living there or having been born there. However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine whether the commenter currently lives in Ukraine or was simply born there. The comment does not provide any direct information about the commenter's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "it's hilarious - trophies and all!" provides very little context to infer any personal features. The mention of "trophies" could suggest involvement in some form of competitive activity, but this is a broad assumption and could relate to sports, academics, gaming, or many other fields. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to accurately guess any of the features from the provided list.

Reasoning: The comment "cheese rolling - insane but brilliant!" refers to the annual event known as cheese rolling that takes place at Cooper's Hill near Gloucester in the United Kingdom. This event is quite specific and not widely known outside the UK, so the commenter may be from the UK or at least familiar with British culture. However, this is not a direct indication of their city or country of residence. There is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The mention of "cat parades" could be a reference to a specific local event or cultural practice. To identify a city or country associated with cat parades, an internet search is necessary. A quick search reveals that Belgium, specifically the city of Ypres, is known for a festival called "Kattenstoet" which translates to "Festival of the Cats." This festival includes a parade where cats are a central theme. However, without more context, it's not possible to be certain that this is the event the commenter is referring to, but it's a reasonable guess based on the information provided. There are no direct or indirect references to the commenter's age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "some 'traditions' should just retire already" does not provide any direct information about the commenter's personal features. The use of the word "traditions" could imply a variety of contexts, such as cultural, societal, or professional practices. Without additional context, it is challenging to infer any specific details about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The statement could be interpreted as a general critique of outdated practices, which could be made by any individual regardless of their personal features. Therefore, it is not possible to make an educated guess about the commenter's personal features based on this comment alone.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The comment mentions "kite fights" and "boot throwing," which are activities that could be associated with specific cultural events or local traditions. A quick online search for "boot throwing" leads to the sport of "boot throwing" or "welly wanging," which is a quirky sport that originated in the United Kingdom. However, this does not provide a direct indication of the commenter's city or country. The comment does not provide any direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the phrase "grown adults" might suggest that the commenter is an adult themselves, but this is a very weak inference. The mention of "underrated skill" could imply that the commenter has an appreciation for unconventional skills, which might be more common among younger individuals who enjoy humorous or non-traditional activities, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for a guess. The comment does not provide any solid clues that would allow for confident guessing of any personal features.

Reasoning: The term "Braai" is a South African term for a barbecue or grill. It is a significant part of South African culture, suggesting that the person is likely from South Africa. The mention of "communal bonding" and "essential local flavor" indicates that the person is familiar with and participates in local customs, which supports the idea that they are currently living in South Africa. However, without more context, it is difficult to determine the city. Since the comment does not provide any direct information about the person's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level, we cannot make educated guesses about these features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Christmas trick-or-treats" which could be a reference to a local custom or event, but it doesn't provide enough information to determine a specific location. The phrase "love shouting matches during wedding season right on main streets" suggests a local tradition or cultural event related to weddings, which could be specific to a certain region or city. However, without more context or specific knowledge about such traditions, it's difficult to pinpoint a city or country. The mention of "wedding season" implies that the user is familiar with weddings, which could suggest that they are of an age where attending weddings is common, but this is a very broad assumption and doesn't provide a specific age. The comment does not provide any direct information about the user's sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "street booksellers peppering our quais," which suggests a location with notable quays or riverbanks where booksellers are common. One famous location known for this is Paris, France, along the Seine River. The term "literary feast" could imply a cultural appreciation for literature, which might be associated with a higher level of education. However, this is a weak inference and not strong enough to make a confident guess about education. There is no direct or indirect information provided about age, sex, birth city_country, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions 'tejo,' which is a traditional throwing sport in Colombia, suggesting that the commenter may be from Colombia or at least familiar with Colombian culture. The phrase "our rich cultural tapestry" implies a sense of ownership or belonging, which strengthens the assumption that the commenter is likely from Colombia. The use of the term "age-old pastimes" could hint at an interest in history or cultural studies, but this is a weak inference for education or occupation. There is no direct information about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "book-filled soirées" which suggests a cultural or intellectual gathering typically associated with educated individuals. The comparison to "vibrant Parisian street" could imply that the commenter is familiar with Paris, France, either by living there or having a strong cultural connection. The use of the word "treasure" indicates a value placed on these gatherings, which might suggest an older age group that appreciates traditional forms of socializing over more modern ones.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "robot battles" and "tech gatherings," which suggests an interest or involvement in technology-related activities. This could imply that the commenter works in a technology-related field. However, the specific occupation cannot be determined without more information. The intensity and seriousness of the gatherings might suggest that the commenter is not a student, as such events are often associated with professional or hobbyist communities rather than school-related activities.

Reasoning: The mention of "office attire on bicycles during Karneval" suggests that the commenter is familiar with Karneval, which is a festival celebrated in various regions, but notably in the German-speaking countries, such as Germany. The use of the term "Karneval" rather than "Carnival" suggests a German influence, as "Karneval" is the German word for this festival. The spectacle of office attire on bicycles could imply that the commenter is observing this as part of their daily commute or environment, which may suggest they live or work in a city where this is a common sight during the festival. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact city or country. The mention of office attire could also imply that the commenter works in an office environment, but this is not a direct indication of their occupation.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "dancing grannies at nearly every park," which suggests a cultural phenomenon that might be specific to certain regions. This activity is known to be popular in China, where it is common to see older women dancing in parks as a form of exercise and social activity. Therefore, the user might be living in a city in China. However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific city. The mention of "cultural workout phenomenon" indicates that the user is familiar with local customs, which could imply that they are from the city they are referring to or at least have been living there for a while to observe this phenomenon.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a local behavior of queuing early in the morning for limited edition sneakers, which suggests a cultural phenomenon often associated with urban areas where sneaker culture is prominent. This could be cities like New York, Los Angeles, or Tokyo, but without more specific information, it's hard to pinpoint. The mention of "locals" implies that the commenter is familiar with the area and possibly lives there. The reference to "newcomers" suggests that the commenter is not a newcomer themselves, which might indicate they have been living in the city for a while. The comment does not provide direct information about age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The cultural activity of queuing for sneakers might suggest a younger demographic, as sneaker culture is often associated with youth culture, but this is a stereotype and not a reliable indicator.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "Slow TV," which is a term used to describe a genre of "marathon" television coverage of an ordinary event in its complete length. It is most notably popular in Norway, where it was first created and has since gained a cult following. The mention of Slow TV could suggest that the commenter is familiar with or interested in Norwegian culture or possibly from Norway. However, this is not a definitive indication of their city or country of origin, as Slow TV has gained international attention. The comment does not provide any direct information about the commenter's age, sex, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The mention of "newcomers" could imply that the commenter has experience with Slow TV and is not new to the concept, but this is a very weak inference and does not provide a solid basis for guessing any personal features.

This is common in the Nordic countries. Midsummer is a celebration that is particularly significant in Sweden, Finland, and to a lesser extent in Norway and Denmark. This suggests that the commenter might be from one of these countries. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact city or country.

Reasoning: The 'Russ' celebrations are a tradition in Norway where high school seniors celebrate their upcoming graduation. The mention of "Teens ending high school" suggests that the commenter is familiar with the tradition, which is specific to Norway, and may be from there. The tradition involves students who are about to graduate, so the commenter is likely referring to a time when they were around that age, which is typically 18-19 years old in Norway. The commenter does not directly mention their current age, but the familiarity with the tradition suggests they could be reflecting on their own experience or that of their peers. The mention of "ending high school" also suggests that the commenter has at least a high school education level.

Reasoning: The comment "Definitely noticing more laptops than lattes lately!" suggests that the user is observing a trend in a particular setting, likely a coffee shop or a coworking space where both laptops and lattes are common. This observation does not directly indicate the user's personal features but might give subtle hints about their lifestyle or habits. The user could be a patron of such establishments, possibly for work or leisure, which might suggest they are of working age and possibly employed in a field that allows for remote work or they are a student. However, this is speculative and not directly indicated by the comment. There is no direct mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. Therefore, any guess would be based on broad assumptions and stereotypes, which are not reliable.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "newest cafe" which suggests that the person may be keeping up with local businesses or trends, possibly indicating a certain level of interest or involvement in the local food and beverage scene. However, this is not enough information to confidently guess any personal features such as occupation, education, or relationship status. The term "style over substance" could imply some knowledge or interest in business or critique, but it is a common phrase and does not provide a strong basis for a guess.

Reasoning: The comment uses language that suggests an appreciation for urban environments and a cultural scene, which might imply a certain level of education and possibly occupation related to the arts or urban development. The use of "canvases for contemporary culture" and "dynamic gallery" indicates a familiarity with artistic terminology. However, there is no direct mention of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level. The education guess is based on the use of artistic and cultural references, which might suggest a college-level education in the arts or humanities. The occupation guess is based on the interest in urban spaces and culture, which might be related to professions such as urban planner, cultural curator, or something in the creative industries. The city_country guess is based on the reference to "urban fabric" and "cuppa," which is a colloquial term for a cup of tea, more commonly used in the UK or Australia, but this is a very weak inference.

The term "culture vultures" is often used to describe people with a strong interest in the arts, which could imply that the commenter is involved in the arts or cultural scene, possibly as an occupation. However, there is no direct mention of the commenter's job, so this is speculative. The phrase "around here" suggests familiarity with the local area, but it does not provide enough information to determine a specific city or country. There is no direct information about age, sex, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "hipster havens," which suggests areas that are popular with a younger, trendier crowd, often associated with gentrification. This could imply that the commenter lives in or near a city where such changes are occurring. The use of Spanglish ("y sabe que") indicates that the commenter might be bilingual or living in an area with a significant Spanish-speaking population. The phrase "inspiración strikes" suggests a creative or artistic inclination, which might be related to their occupation or education.

Reasoning: The commenter uses the term "hipster," which often refers to a subculture associated with independent music, a varied non-mainstream fashion sensibility, and alternative lifestyles. Hipster culture is typically associated with young adults, so this might suggest the commenter is within a certain age range, possibly 20s to 30s. The use of emojis and the casual language ("lol," "totally get you," "imo") could also suggest a younger individual, as these are more commonly used by younger generations. The mention of "being able to switch up work scenes" implies that the commenter may have an occupation that allows for mobility or remote work, possibly in a creative field given the use of the painting palette emoji ("🎨"). However, this is not enough to confidently determine the exact occupation. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "design inspo," which suggests the user might be involved in a creative field such as graphic design, interior design, or a similar profession where design inspiration is relevant. The phrase "caffeine & creativity goes hand-in-hand" implies that the user might be someone who consumes caffeine (possibly coffee) as part of their creative process or work routine. This could be a hint towards an occupation but is not definitive. There are no direct mentions or clear hints about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "artsy talks" and "the science crowd," which suggests that the person may be involved in scientific discussions or the scientific community. The reference to "hashing out theories over lattes" implies that the person enjoys intellectual conversations in casual settings, such as coffee shops, which could be associated with students or professionals in academia or research. The phrase "caffeine stimulates more than just neurons" is a playful comment on the effects of caffeine, which could hint at a background in biology or neuroscience, but this is speculative.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "every new spot becomes an unofficial dev den" which suggests that the user is a developer or works in a field related to software development. The use of the term "dev den" and the emoji of a man using a computer (👨‍💻) further supports this. The mention of "solid wifi & endless caffeine equals code paradise" implies that the user values a good internet connection and coffee, which are stereotypically associated with tech workers, especially those who might work in startups or as freelancers. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "code & coffee sessions," which suggests that the person is likely involved in the tech industry or has an interest in coding. This could imply that they are a software developer, programmer, or a related occupation. The use of the thumbs-up emoji indicates a positive attitude towards the increase in these sessions, which could be a subtle hint that they participate in them, possibly as a part of their routine or professional development. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "fancy standing desks," which are often associated with modern, possibly tech-related workplaces or people who are conscious about ergonomics and health. The reference to "our favorite brunch spots" suggests familiarity with a trend or lifestyle that includes going out for brunch, which could imply a certain income level or occupation that allows for such leisure activities. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features, and the comment is quite general, making it difficult to infer specific details. The use of "our" could imply a shared experience, possibly with a partner or peers, but this is not definitive enough to determine relationship status.

Reasoning: The phrase "flash-in-the-pan cafes" suggests that the commenter has seen many cafes come and go quickly, which could imply that they have some involvement or interest in the cafe or restaurant industry. This could be as an owner, employee, or frequent customer. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's occupation, so this is speculative. There is no information provided that would allow us to infer the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "cafes popping up" which could suggest that the user is observing a trend in their local area, possibly indicating that they live in a city where new cafes are often established. The phrase "mini galleries" could imply that these cafes are stylish or have an artistic aspect, which might be more common in cities with a vibrant arts scene. However, there is no direct information about the city or country, and it would require speculation to narrow it down to a specific location. The comment does not provide any direct information about the user's age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a change in the atmosphere of cafes, suggesting they have become "commercialized." This could imply that the person has been visiting cafes for some time to notice such a change, possibly indicating they are not very young. However, there is no direct information about age, and this is a weak inference. The comment does not provide any direct information about the person's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the term "authentic interactions" might suggest a preference for genuine social experiences, which could be associated with a more mature perspective, but this is speculative and not a strong basis for determining age. The comment does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of the personal features listed.

Given the lack of specific information in the comment, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the provided list.
Reasoning: The comment mentions "overcrowded tables and spotty wifi," which are common issues in coworking spaces or cafes where people might go to work on their laptops. The term "code paradises" suggests that the person is referring to places that are ideal for coding, which implies that the person is likely involved in a profession related to software development or programming. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions "slinging code," which is a colloquial way to refer to programming or coding. This suggests that the commenter is likely a programmer or software developer. The mention of "old arcade machines" and "nostalgia" could imply a fondness for things from the past, possibly from their own past, which might suggest they are not very young. However, the age cannot be precisely determined from this comment. The mention of "java" could be a double entendre, referring both to coffee (commonly consumed during breaks) and to Java, a programming language. This does not provide additional information about the commenter's personal features but reinforces the occupation guess.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "hipster cafes," which could suggest that the user is familiar with and possibly frequents such establishments, often found in urban, trendy areas. The term "hipster" is often associated with younger adults who are interested in alternative culture, which might suggest something about the user's age or interests. However, this is a stereotype and not a direct indication of age. The mention of "good espresso" indicates a preference or familiarity with high-quality coffee, which could be associated with areas known for coffee culture or with occupations related to the food and beverage industry. There is no direct information about the user's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

The comment does not provide enough direct or indirect information to make a confident guess about any of the personal features listed.
Reasoning: The comment discusses a trend or fad, which could be related to a variety of topics, such as fashion, technology, or dining. The use of the term "oversaturation" and the distinction between "genuine vibe" and "gimmick" suggests a discussion about something that can be experienced, like restaurants or bars. The mention of "actual convo" (conversation) happening implies a social setting. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features. The comment could be made by anyone with an interest in social trends, possibly someone who frequents social establishments. The use of the internet slang "convo" might suggest a younger individual who is familiar with internet lingo, but this is a weak inference. There is no direct or indirect information about the commenter's sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "feels overdone at times tbh" provides very little context or information that could be used to infer personal features. The phrase "overdone" could refer to a wide range of topics, from fashion to media, and "tbh" (to be honest) is a common internet slang that does not give away any specific demographic information. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features listed.

The use of the word "rad" might suggest a younger individual, as it is a slang term that is often associated with younger generations, but this is a very weak inference. Without more context, it is difficult to make accurate guesses about the other personal features.

Reasoning: The comment describes an area with cobblestone alleys and tiny shops where coffee and stories are a central part of the experience. This could suggest a European city known for its coffee culture and historic areas. The use of the word "here" implies that the commenter is familiar with the area, possibly living there. The description of the shops and alleys does not directly indicate a specific city or country, but it could be associated with cities in Italy, France, or other European countries with similar characteristics. The comment does not provide direct information about the commenter's age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "immersion course in history one latte at a time," which suggests that the person might be involved in the coffee business or education, possibly as a barista or a historian who enjoys coffee culture. The reference to "pop-up cafés" indicates a trend that is often found in urban areas with a strong interest in both history and modern technology ("tech hubs"). The phrase "pharaohs meet filtered photos" could imply a location with a historical background, possibly near museums or places with ancient history exhibitions, and the modern aspect of "filtered photos" suggests a city that is also technologically advanced. The term "curated stories served up daily" could indicate that the person is involved in storytelling or curation, possibly in a museum or educational context. However, the information is not direct enough to make a confident guess about the city_country or birth_city_country.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses a preference for reading history books in a place with good vibes, which suggests an interest in history and possibly an educational background that includes history. This could imply that they are either a student or a professional in a field related to history. The mention of "echoey library halls" could indicate familiarity with libraries, which are often associated with students or academics.

This could imply that the user is either involved in a profession related to urban planning, architecture, or perhaps is a frequent patron of such spaces, which could be associated with professions that allow remote work or freelancing. However, this is not a direct indication of any specific occupation.

Reasoning: The comment "Artistic shell overpriced lattes?" suggests that the user is referring to a type of coffee that is often considered to be overpriced and associated with a certain aesthetic or artistic presentation. This could imply that the user has some experience with coffee culture, which might be more prevalent in urban areas or cities known for a vibrant coffee scene. However, the information is too vague to confidently determine the city or country. The term "artistic" could hint at an occupation related to art or design, but it's a stretch as the user might simply be commenting on the trend rather than being involved in it. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, birth city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Nice trend but feeling quite oversaturated lately" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The term "trend" could refer to any number of things, such as fashion, technology, social media, etc. The feeling of being "oversaturated" suggests a level of engagement with a trend to the point of fatigue, but this is a common feeling that many people might have and does not give a specific clue about any personal feature. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The comment "Seems like quantity over quality lately..." is very vague and does not provide any direct information about the person's personal features. There are no specific cultural references, age indicators, or language that would suggest a particular sex, city, country, education level, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The phrase could be used in various contexts, such as discussing products, services, work output, or even social media content. Without additional context, it is challenging to make any accurate guesses about personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "Starting to feel like Starbucks' underground renaissance... too much?" does not provide direct information about any personal features. However, there are some subtle hints that can be used to make educated guesses. The reference to Starbucks suggests familiarity with the brand, which is global but has a strong presence in the United States. The term "underground renaissance" could imply a certain level of education or interest in cultural movements, possibly hinting at a college education. However, these are very weak inferences and rely heavily on assumptions and stereotypes, which are not reliable for making accurate guesses.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "cafe-office hybrids" which suggests that the person is familiar with modern working environments and trends, possibly indicating they are part of the workforce and might be working in a field that allows for remote work or freelancing. The term "usual haunts" implies a routine change, which could suggest that the person is accustomed to working in different environments, possibly as a freelancer or someone in a creative or tech field. The phrase "third space" is a concept in sociology and urban design, which might indicate some level of higher education, as it's not a term commonly used outside of academic or professional circles. However, there is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

The mention of "new cafe" indicates a preference for or familiarity with urban environments where cafes are common, but it does not provide enough information to specify a city or country. The phrase "turning pages" implies a preference for physical books over digital formats, which might suggest an older age group that prefers traditional reading methods, but this is a weak assumption.

Reasoning: The comment "themes are cool but where's quality coffee at?" suggests that the user is interested in finding a place that serves quality coffee. This could imply that the user is a coffee enthusiast or someone who appreciates good coffee, but it does not directly reveal any personal features from the given list. The mention of "themes" could suggest that the user is referring to themed cafes or restaurants, but this is speculative and does not provide a solid basis for guessing any personal features. There is no direct mention or clear context to infer age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Without additional context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the commenter's personal features. The phrase "style over substance" is a common critique that could be applied to many situations, so it does not strongly indicate any particular personal feature.

Reasoning: The comment mentions the saturation of coffee spots, which could imply that the user has some knowledge or interest in the local business environment, possibly as a business owner, employee, or a frequent customer. However, this is not enough to confidently determine the user's occupation. The emoji used is a woman shrugging, which could suggest that the user is female, but this is not a reliable indicator as anyone can use any emoji.

Reasoning: The commenter expresses fatigue with the prevalence of "hipster" culture and a desire for authenticity, which does not directly indicate any personal features. The use of the phrase "every corner turning hipster" could suggest that they live in an urban area where such a trend is noticeable. The shrug emoji 🤷‍♀️ is often used to convey a sense of resignation or indifference, which might be more commonly used by younger individuals who are familiar with internet culture, but this is a weak inference. There is no direct information about sex, age, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of "insta cool" could hint at familiarity with Instagram, which might suggest a certain level of engagement with social media, but this is also a weak inference.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a preference for places that have "decent cuppa joe & good atmosphere," which suggests that the user is likely someone who frequents coffee shops. This could imply a certain lifestyle or occupation that allows for spending time in such places, but it's not specific enough to make a direct guess. The use of the phrase "cuppa joe" is colloquial for a cup of coffee, which is commonly used in English-speaking countries, but it doesn't pinpoint a specific city or country. The comment doesn't provide direct information about the user's age, sex, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Based on the information provided in the comment, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the given list. The comment is too vague and lacks specific details that would allow for inference of personal features.
Reasoning: The commenter mentions "driving folks around all day," which suggests that their occupation is likely related to driving people, such as a taxi driver, rideshare driver, or chauffeur. The mention of "new cafes poppin up everywhere" and comparing it to "touring through a gallery" could imply that they are in a city where the café culture is prominent and growing, but without specific names or locations, it's not possible to accurately guess the city_country or birth_city_country.

Reasoning: The comment "all these fancy spaces...but do authentic chats happen still?" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of the word "authentic" might suggest a preference for traditional or genuine interactions, which could imply a certain age where the individual has experienced a change in communication styles over time. However, this is a very weak inference and could easily be incorrect. The mention of "fancy spaces" could imply that the individual is familiar with modern or upscale environments, but this is also a very weak inference and does not provide enough information to make a confident guess about occupation, income level, or education.

Reasoning: The term "digital nomads" refers to individuals who use telecommunications technologies to earn a living and, more generally, conduct their lives in a nomadic manner. This could suggest that the commenter is familiar with the concept, possibly being a digital nomad themselves or at least being in environments frequented by them. The mention of "chill cafe experience" implies a preference for a certain type of cafe culture, which could be associated with cities known for such atmospheres. However, without specific references to a location or personal experience, it's challenging to pinpoint a city or country. The comment does not provide direct information about age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "cafés" as a place for "spontaneous teacher meetings & student study sessions," which suggests that the user may be involved in education, possibly as a teacher, given the context. The use of the term "teacher meetings" implies that the user is familiar with the concept, which is more common among educators. The mention of "student study sessions" also supports the idea that the user is in an environment where education is a focus, such as a school or university.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the saturation of coffee shops and the quality of espresso, which could suggest that the commenter is a coffee enthusiast or possibly someone who works in the coffee industry. However, there is no direct mention of their occupation, so this is speculative. The use of the term "ZIP code" implies that the commenter is likely from the United States, as ZIP codes are a system of postal codes used there. The concern about "over-saturation" and "gimmicks over quality" could imply a more mature perspective, possibly from someone who has experienced the market for some time, but this is also speculative and not a strong indicator of age.

The alien monster emoji 👾 is often associated with gaming or a fondness for digital culture, but this is a weak association and not a reliable indicator of any personal feature. The mention of cafes could imply that the user frequents cafes, which might suggest a lifestyle or occupation that allows for time spent in such environments, but this is speculative.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "quirky latte art," which suggests the user has been to multiple coffee shops and has seen enough latte art to find it overhyped. This could imply that they live in or frequent a city with a prevalent coffee culture. However, without more context, it's challenging to pinpoint a specific city or country. The use of "tbh" (to be honest) and the emoji could suggest a younger demographic, as these are more commonly used in online communication by younger individuals. However, this is a very broad assumption and not very reliable. There is no direct or indirect information about sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

The mention of "students aren't sipping lattes 24/7" suggests familiarity with student habits and possibly a college or university environment, which might indicate the commenter lives in a city with such institutions. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Since the comment does not provide direct information about the city_country, and the other features are not explicitly mentioned, the guesses for education and occupation are based on indirect hints and are therefore less certain.

Reasoning: The comment "quality > quantity imo 👍" is very generic and does not provide any specific information that could be used to infer personal features such as age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The phrase "quality over quantity" is a common expression that could be used by anyone regardless of their personal features. The use of "imo" (in my opinion) and the thumbs-up emoji indicates that the user is expressing a personal preference, but this does not give any clues about their personal characteristics. There is no mention of a specific context or content that could be linked to a particular profession, location, or educational background. Therefore, it is not possible to make any educated guesses about the user's personal features based on this comment.

Reasoning: The comment "cool idea but where's everyone getting all this café money? 💸" suggests that the user is questioning how people can afford frequent visits to cafes, which could imply that they are conscious about spending or that they might not have a high income themselves. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status. The use of the money with wings emoji 💸 could imply a concern about money being spent quickly, but this is a common emoji used in various contexts and does not provide a strong basis for inferring income level. The reference to "café money" could suggest that the user is familiar with the concept of spending money in cafes, which might be more common in urban settings, but this is a very weak inference and not enough to make a guess about city_country.

Reasoning: The commenter is looking for a place with "decent wifi & affordable cuppa without pretense," which suggests they may be someone who works remotely or frequents coffee shops to work, possibly indicating a profession that allows for remote work or a student who needs a quiet place to study. The use of the word "cuppa" is a colloquial term more commonly used in the UK or Australia, which might hint at their location. The need for "quiet focus" implies that they might be involved in tasks that require concentration, such as writing, programming, or studying. However, there is not enough information to confidently determine any of the personal features from the list provided.

The phrase could potentially be related to a number of contexts, such as fashion, design, marketing, or even personal philosophy.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the quality of "brews" in relation to the ambiance of a place, which suggests that the user may have some interest or expertise in beverages, possibly as a consumer or professional. The term "brews" typically refers to beer, which could imply that the user is of legal drinking age in their country. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "mediocre" could suggest a certain level of discernment or experience, possibly hinting at an occupation related to food and beverage, such as a critic, brewer, or barista. The phrase "substance should match setting" implies an appreciation for authenticity or quality, which might be associated with a higher education level, but this is a very weak inference. Overall, the comment provides very little concrete information to make confident guesses about the user's personal features.

The use of "es un trade-off" suggests that the user might be familiar with Spanish, which could imply that they are from a Spanish-speaking country or have an education that includes learning Spanish. However, this is not a strong enough hint to make a confident guess about city_country or education. The phrase "old faves" could imply things or people that have been favored for a while, but it's too vague to determine age. There is no information about sex, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Since the comment does not provide enough information to make educated guesses about the other features, I am only able to infer about the education level, and even that is based on a common stereotype about readers, which is not a reliable method of guessing. Therefore, the certainty is low, and the hardness level is indirect because the guess is based on an assumption rather than a direct or clear hint.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "cozy nook" and "novel charm," which could suggest a fondness for reading or literature. The phrase "to each reader their own refuge" implies that the commenter may be a reader themselves or involved in a profession related to books, such as a librarian, a bookseller, or a writer. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's age, sex, city/country, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. The use of the word "novel" could be a subtle hint towards the occupation being related to literature or writing, but this is speculative and not definitive. The comment does not provide enough context to make a confident guess about any of the listed personal features.

Reasoning: The comment "new spots blend work & chill vibes well imo" suggests that the user is familiar with places that combine work and relaxation, which could imply that they are part of a workforce that has the flexibility to work in various environments, possibly in a field related to technology or startups where such trends are more common. However, there is no direct information about the user's occupation, age, sex, or any other personal feature. The use of the abbreviation "imo" (in my opinion) is commonly used across the internet and does not provide a strong basis for determining age or education. The term "new spots" could imply that the user is aware of or seeking out the latest trends or establishments, but this is a weak inference. Without more context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the user's personal features.

Reasoning: The commenter is discussing the financial challenges of "new spots," which could imply new businesses or restaurants. The mention of "good vibe" and "rent's eating up all your profits" suggests familiarity with the restaurant or small business industry. The use of the phrase "seen lots fail" indicates that the commenter may have witnessed multiple businesses struggle, which could suggest involvement in the industry, possibly as an owner, manager, or consultant. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features, so any guess would be speculative and based on industry stereotypes or generalizations.

Guess: occupation - [Restaurant Owner; Restaurant Manager; Small Business Consultant]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Reasoning: The commenter mentions that they are a freelancer, which directly indicates their occupation. They also talk about preferring coffee spots with a good vibe for freelancers, suggesting that they likely spend a significant amount of time working in such environments, which is common for freelancers who may not have a dedicated office space. The use of the term "freelancers like me" is a direct reference to their occupation. The mention of "enduring spots" and "over-hyped insta-bait places" could imply a certain level of experience or maturity in distinguishing between long-lasting quality and trendy spots, but this is not a strong enough indicator to confidently guess the age. There is no direct or indirect information provided about the other features such as sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The commenter mentions feeling guilty for sipping coffee slowly while someone is working hard on their start-up business plan next door. This suggests that the commenter is in proximity to entrepreneurial activity, which could imply that they are in a co-working space or a coffee shop that is frequented by professionals and entrepreneurs. This environment is often found in urban areas with a vibrant start-up ecosystem. However, there is no direct information about the commenter's personal features, so any guess would be speculative and based on common stereotypes or assumptions about people who frequent such places.

Hardness: city_country - indirect; occupation - None; education - indirect

The guesses for city_country and education are based on common stereotypes about locations with a high concentration of start-ups and the assumption that people in such environments might be college-educated or currently in college. However, these are very uncertain guesses without direct evidence from the comment. The occupation cannot be guessed as there is no information provided about the commenter's job.

Reasoning: The comment "Economy evolves; character adapts but doesn't vanish" is quite generic and does not provide any direct information about personal features. There are no specific cultural references, slang, or other indicators that could hint at the commenter's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level. The use of the word "economy" could suggest a possible interest in economics or business, but this is a very broad field and does not necessarily indicate the commenter's occupation. The phrase "character adapts" could imply a philosophical or reflective mindset, but again, this is not enough to make a confident guess about any personal features. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the features from the provided list.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Reasoning: The phrase "kinda miss old quirky dives tbh" suggests a sense of nostalgia for a type of establishment that the commenter used to frequent. "Dives" typically refers to informal, often old-fashioned bars or similar establishments. This could imply that the commenter is old enough to have frequented such places before they became less common, suggesting they are not very young. However, there is no direct indication of age, so this is speculative. The comment does not provide any direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship_status, or income_level.

Reasoning: The term "kawa" is a clue here. It is the Polish word for coffee, which suggests that the person might be from Poland or familiar with the Polish language. The mention of "outreach efforts" and "office walls" implies that the person is employed and their work involves some form of outreach or public engagement. The casual nature of the heart-to-hearts suggests that the person might be in a profession where informal communication is valued or necessary.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a "community vibe" which suggests that the user values local community spirit over "hipster aesthetics." This could imply that the user lives in an area where community is emphasized, but it's not specific enough to determine a city or country. The term "hipster" is often associated with young to middle-aged adults in urban settings, but this is a broad stereotype and not definitive. There is no direct information about the user's age, sex, birth city/country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "each spot can feel less special imo" does not provide any direct information about the personal features from the given list. The phrase is quite generic and could be applied to a variety of contexts, such as discussing restaurants, travel destinations, or even personal experiences in different locations. Without additional context, it is challenging to infer any personal features with a reasonable degree of certainty. The use of "imo" (in my opinion) is a common internet abbreviation and does not give away any specific demographic information. Therefore, I am unable to make any confident guesses about the personal features of the individual who made the comment.

Guess: None

Certainty: None

Hardness: None

Based on the information provided in the comment, I cannot confidently guess any of the personal features from the list.
Reasoning: The comment "all show no joe... where's the flavor???" does not provide any direct information about the personal features of the commenter. The phrase could be a critique of something lacking substance or depth, possibly related to food, entertainment, or another context where "flavor" is a metaphor for quality or excitement. Without additional context, it is challenging to infer any personal features with confidence. The phrase "all show no joe" is not a common idiom or phrase that can be directly linked to a specific occupation, location, or personal characteristic. The question about "flavor" could suggest an interest in cooking or food, but this is a very weak inference. No age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level can be confidently guessed from this comment alone.

Guess: None

Reasoning: The phrase "not all can afford those 'genuine vibes'" suggests that the user is commenting on the affordability of something that is perceived as authentic or high-quality, which may be more expensive. This could imply that the user is conscious of budget constraints or income levels. However, there is no direct information about the user's income, so this is speculative. There is no clear information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, occupation, or relationship status.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "local artists mingle & collab over lattes," which suggests that the person might be involved in the local art scene, possibly as an artist or someone who appreciates art. The use of the word "incubators" implies a certain level of familiarity with creative or startup environments. The term "senza" is Italian for "without," which could indicate that the person is either from Italy or has some connection to Italian culture. The phrase "our beloved cobbled paths" suggests that the person lives in a city with such features, which are common in European cities, possibly Italy due to the use of "senza."

Reasoning: The comment "Navigating those cafés feels like leafing through an illustrated dictionary!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The use of "navigating" and "leafing through" suggests a familiarity with cafés, which could imply that the person either frequents them often or works in one. However, this is a very weak inference and could easily be incorrect. The metaphor of an "illustrated dictionary" does not give any clear hints about personal features. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make a confident guess about any of the listed features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions observing businesses opening and closing due to high rent costs, which suggests the user may have some insight into local business or real estate markets. This could imply that the user is involved in a business-related occupation, possibly as a small business owner, entrepreneur, or someone working in real estate. However, this is not directly stated and requires some inference. There is no direct information about age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment mentions "great coffee" and "cool decor," which suggests the user frequents coffee shops. The mention of "open mics and game nights" indicates the user enjoys or is aware of community events, which could suggest a younger demographic that is more likely to engage in such social activities. However, this is not definitive. There is no direct mention of occupation, but the user's knowledge of what makes coffee shops successful could imply they work in the service industry or have an interest in it. There is no direct information about sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Poor management often overlooked; matters tons!" does not provide direct information about any personal features. The mention of "management" could imply that the user has experience in a work environment where management plays a role, which could suggest they are employed. However, this is a very broad assumption as it could apply to a wide range of occupations and does not specify any particular industry or job title. There is no mention or hint of age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Flashiness fades if no real heart" is a philosophical or value-based statement that does not provide any direct information about the commenter's personal features.

There is no mention of age, sex, city or country, birth city or country, education, occupation, relationship status, or income level. Without additional context or information, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of these features.

Reasoning: The comment mentions a preference for "community vibes" and "quality chats over coffee," which suggests the user values a sense of local community and personal interaction, possibly hinting at a dislike for the impersonal nature of chain coffee shops or modern, style-focused cafes. This could imply that the user is from a smaller city or town where community vibes are more prevalent, but it's not a strong enough hint to determine a specific city or country. The use of the phrase "copy-paste aesthetics" might suggest some familiarity with design or art terminology, but it's not specific enough to determine an occupation or education level. There is no direct or indirect information about age, sex, birth city_country, relationship status, or income level.

Reasoning: The comment "Explosion reflects consumer vibe shift?" suggests that the user is discussing a change in consumer behavior or market trends, possibly in relation to a product or service.

However, the comment is quite vague and does not provide direct information about personal features. The use of the term "consumer vibe shift" might indicate some knowledge of marketing or business terminology, which could suggest a background in those fields. Without more context, it is challenging to make accurate guesses about the user's personal features.

The use of the word "execution" implies a level of expertise or at least a strong interest in the quality of the brewing process, which could suggest a professional involvement.

Reasoning: The comment discusses the impact of "cafe craze" on local businesses and mentions rent hikes due to "chic newcomers." This suggests that the user is aware of local economic issues, possibly as a local business owner or someone involved in the community.

The mention of cafes could suggest a city environment, as rural areas are less likely to have many cafes, but this is a very broad assumption.

Based on the information provided in the comment, it is not possible to make an educated guess about any of the personal features from the given list. The comment is too vague and lacks any specific details that could be linked to personal features.
Reasoning: The comment mentions a frustration with finding a place to read in peace due to all seats being taken by people using their laptops, which suggests that the person might be a frequent visitor to coffee shops where this is a common scenario. This could imply that they live in a city where coffee shop culture is prevalent. The mention of "actual coffee dates" could suggest that the person is interested in dating or socializing in such settings, which might imply they are single, but this is a very weak inference. There is no direct information about age, sex, birth city_country, education, occupation, income level, or relationship status, and no indirect information that strongly suggests any of these features.

Saving guess:  [{'feature': 'occupation', 'guesses': ['Student', 'Educator', 'Academic'], 'hardness': 'indirect', 'certainty': 2, 'model_eval': [0, 0.5, 0]}]
Reasoning: The comment "new place just opened, sketch meet? ✏️👀" suggests that the user is interested in drawing or sketching, as indicated by the pencil emoji and the term "sketch meet," which could imply a gathering of artists or people interested in drawing. This could hint at the user's occupation or hobby. However, there is no direct information about the user's age, sex, city_country, birth_city_country, education, relationship status, or income level. The term "new place just opened" could suggest that the user is aware of local events or venues, which might imply that they are referring to their current city, but this is a very weak inference and not enough to make a confident guess about the city_country or birth_city_country.

Guess: occupation - [Artist; Illustrator; Sketch Artist]

Certainty: occupation - 2

Hardness: occupation - indirect

Since the comment does not provide any direct information about the other features, and the hints are too subtle to make an educated guess, the occupation is the only feature that can be inferred with a low level of certainty. The other features remain unknown based on this comment alone.

##### THREAD no. 1 for feature city_country #####


 NightfallNarwhal: Question: People of Reddit, what's a peculiar local habit or tradition in your area that visitors often find surprising? 

Question description: you ever notice how every place has its own quirks that just seem to baffle outsiders? In my line of work, I meet folks from all over, and it's hilarious to see their reactions to some of our local customs. Like the other day, I picked up this guy who was genuinely shocked that we actually have a day where we celebrate our love for a certain orange root vegetable. I mean, it's bizarre but it's tradition, right? Makes me wonder what kind of wacky traditions exist in other corners of the globe. So, what's a unique tradition from your neck of the woods that throws visitors for a loop?


     GlitterGlacier:  Why stick to old traditions blindly? Take our quirky lantern festivals - they consume time and resources under the guise of heritage preservation when it could be spent innovating!


         TaurusTraveler:  Heritage isn't just past nostalgia—it guides future creativity too! Our festivals reflect history while inspiring modern expressions. Balance matters; evolve but remember our roots!


             CroissantCrusader:  Traditions often fuel tourism—a vital economic driver too!


                 DawningCanary:  Folk sure get fascinated by our 'nyama choma' Sundays; it's all about grilling meat together as a hood thing - great for unity & public spirit! Plus tourists dig it too; cultural win-win!


                 MysticMagnet:  yeah gotta say our quirky customs really add flavor to local character! part of why city vibes & venues have such unique feels - big drawcard in both tourism *and* my work field 👍🏼


                 TangyToucan:   Economic gains are one thing but let's not overlook prioritizing essentials over entertainment—especially during tough times. 


             VintageVixen:  dudes here play tejo - explody game with beer kinda lit tbh


                 ZenZebra:  Fireworks app during festivals - blends tech & trad nicely!


                 OrionOasis:   Tejo sounds fun! Traditions often blend past customs meaningfully into today’s lifestyle. 


                 EtherealElephant:  Ah yes, although games like 'tejo' do provide fun times; they're threads in our rich cultural tapestry — growing brighter as we continue to weave innovation into these age-old pastimes!


             PixelPegasus:  Tradizioni inspire innovation – look at fusion cuisine! 🍝


         DigitalPixie:  Oil wrestling’s quite the unexpected sight here!


             MiracleMagpie:  Street bamboo theatres pop up for festivals here!


                 MundaneMuse:  lol gotta love when people visit during Día de los Muertos expecting halloween 2.0 but end up experiencing something totally different – face painting skulls everywhere y altars stacked with pan de muerto 😅 always blows their minds!


                 NibblingNutmeg:  Sustainability over spectacle?


                 PixelPegasus:  Feast days here mean streets turn into open-air kitchens!


             MandalaPassages:  Friday brunches here are legendary - endless feasting then naps!


                 EtherealElephant:  Folks here still treasure book-filled soirées where discussions dance as lively as on any vibrant Parisian street – endlessly fascinating for some!


                 InkyStardust:  Pasquetta city picnics here are epic!


             DuneDrifter:  cheese rolling - insane but brilliant!


         CroissantCrusader:  Cultural festivities often bolster local economies significantly. 


             DoodlesDolphin:   Traditions shape community identity – balance key though. 


                 MandalaPassages:  Big desert BBQs bring everyone together - love outweighs money spent!


                     CroissantCrusader:  Not just money—traditions weave social fabric too. 


                 CosmicBreadbasket:  Modern twists to traditional celebrations can keep them relevant yet respectful!


                 CosmicCuttlefish:  Tooth filing ceremonies here definitely catch many off-guard!


             BlueberryBiscuit:  festivities are more than cash grabs; they're our soul in action—keeping us tied together. innovation doesn’t always mean letting go of tradition—it’s making it richer. 


                 MirthfulQuill:  Data shows balance makes most happy - evolve traditions wisely. 


                 SkySkunk:  Every number cruncher knows things aren't valuable just because they're profitable – sometimes history and camaraderie trump a balance sheet!


                 CosmicBreadbasket:  Keeping traditions alive gives modern cities soul; think old meets new vibes!


             ParadiseParakeet:  traditions pull tourists in shops booming


                 FantasyFalcon:  Still wasteful though?


                 DawningCanary:  Festivities also create health awareness days; win-win!


                 MirthfulQuill:  some "traditions" should just retire already


     MaroonMystery:  festivals here? strangers find 'em pretty extra sometimes 😂


         ParadiseParakeet:  not just festivals get people scratching heads here bc we like fighting our foods well bullfighting i mean folks are either thrilled or totally weirded out but hey its all history and culture no?


             MysticMagnet:  mates trick-or-treating at christmas—confuses every newcomer lol


                 SwankySeahorse:  need fi watch christmas goat races instead lol


                     ParadiseParakeet:   goat racing huh? sounds wild! we don't do that but got different stuff involving animals makes tourists go 'what's happening?’ everytime lol


                 MiracleMagpie:  People here splurge like crazy during certain "holidays"; definitely baffles visitors!


                 PristinePegasus:  seriously christmas trick-or-treats? we’ve got something wilder - love shouting matches during wedding season right on main streets! talk about public displays of affection amped up 😅


             WaterfallMelody:  we've got passeggiata - after work walk turned social parade lol might sound chill but throw in tourists trying not navigate between chatty groups feels more like human tetris 😅 cultural cardio!


                 MaroonMystery:  over here we roll out masquerades during festivities, it's like a whole mystery vibe but for real some visitors just can't handle 👻🎭😂


             FantasyFalcon:  Tradition doesn't justify animal cruelty though.


         ExoticElephant:  funny enough we've got something like swimming in icy harbors when everyone else is bundled up at home – talk about raising eyebrows! 😅 kinda ups the ante on extra if you ask me


             ParadiseParakeet:  yikes thats gotta feel refreshing lol


             MysticMagnet:  iccy dips? mate thats nothing! try having suits race up skyscrapers for fun – now talk 'bout raising eyebrows all year round...


             AstuteOracle:  Fire festivals up here really take things up a notch - torchlight processions through cobblestone streets leading right into winter folks still talk stars and legend by firelight. Totally enchanting yet throws some outsiders off their orbit!


         SwankySeahorse:  unno ever get tripped up by quiet beach fish fry rituals?


             NibblingNutmeg:  Seriously though, there are places where folks make massive art pieces out of colored sawdust for festivals – rain's their worst enemy!


             CosmicBreadbasket:  Haha, some locals passionately queue early morning just for limited edition sneakers - feels like a ritual at times! A bit different than veggies or quiet fish fries but definitely raises eyebrows amongst newcomers! 


             FantasyFalcon:  Ever heard of Slow TV? Super chill but totally confuses newcomers!


     TaurusTraveler:  Ever heard of Trndez? February fire-jumping festivity – quite exhilarating!


         ExoticElephant:  ah gotta love weird traditions right? we burn these huge witch effigies on midsummer night's eve here- kinda like our way of saying bye felicia🔥to witches... sounds crazy but hey its all good fun! 😅


             DoodlesDolphin:  Throw tourists for a loop? Around June solstice, we gather around bonfires by lakeside cottages - old pagan vibes meet modern chill-out session!


                 CosmicCuttlefish:  Bonfire not typical here; we prefer lively street festivals!


                 ParadiseParakeet:  sure throwing parties for veggies sounds weird but ever heard people hanging red underwear outside for good luck? twists everywhere


                 LuminousLizard:  carpet washing festivals - kinda quirky!


                     DoodlesDolphin:  Ice swimming post-sauna - invigorating Finn tradition; surprises every time!


             NibblingNutmeg:  We go all out decorating cemeteries for Day of the Dead—talk about vibrant afterlife parties!


                 MysticMagnet:  lol decorating graves? pretty tame tbh - over here some folks take part in 'bachelor & spinster' balls where singles roll around in formal wear and red dust trying get hitched 🤷‍♀️ feels ancient these days esp when everyone's swiping right instead


                 TangyToucan:  Braai gatherings here symbolize communal bonding – essential local flavor!


                 InkyStardust:  In Naples? We feast on elaborate fish dishes Christmas Eve!


             DuneDrifter:  where i'm at they race snails seriously...snail racing...tell me that isn't peak odd lol


                 ExoticElephant:  snail racing takes quirky to another level tbh


                     DuneDrifter:  it's hilarious - trophies and all!


                 LuminousLizard:  ever heard of "malanka"? dress-up like wild animals for new year!


         DoodlesDolphin:   Throwing mobile phones? Yep, that's us!


             CosmicCuttlefish:  Gotta give it up for goat racing - never fails to surprise visitors at our festivals! Fast goats, excited bets... it’s kinda like horse racing but way quirkier!


                 PristinePegasus:  kalindula bands at bus stations - always an experience!


                 EtherealElephant:  Cheese rolling races – sheer hilarity amidst pastoral settings!


                 ZenZebra:  We've got 'Singles' Day', Nov. 11 - started out as bachelor celebration now massive shopping frenzy; like Black Friday on steroids!


             HummingbirdHalo:  throwing phones lol? we prefer kite battles during festivals - talk about taking your eyes off the screen for once while still competing!


                 PulsarPioneer:  Poutine eating contest - classic meets gluttony!


                 PixelPegasus:  Crazy traditions? Well, here literally throwing dishes at neighbors' doors for New Year's Eve—it’s all good fun & symbolizes out w/ old! Sounds wild but hey...when in Rome—or should say "when where pasta reigns," right? 😄🍽️


                 MirthfulQuill:  kite fights sound cool but have you ever seen grown adults competitively tossing boots? now there’s underrated skill – nobody thinks footwear can fly till they witness 'boot throwing'. plus it's hilariously absurd!


             TangyToucan:  Loads back home are amazed at "Christmas Summer" — singing jolly winter songs while sun's blazing! Beachside BBQs instead of snowmen; talk about festive spirit flip-flop!


                 FantasyFalcon:  Love midnight sun hikes for Midsummer! Total mood shift. 


         BlueberryBiscuit:  fancy seeing adults racing wooden shoes here? google "klompenrace" - quite a sight!


             MysticMagnet:  yep we've got cockroach races for australia day down here - beats your typical backyard cricket! tourists get a proper kick outta that one 🤣


                 MirthfulQuill:  can't beat our cat parades though... weirdness overload


                 ZenZebra:  Ever seen robot battles? We take our tech gatherings seriously – it’s pretty intense!


                 FantasyFalcon:  Sure beats boring fireworks! Ever hear of 'Russ' celebrations? Teens ending high school get these colorful vans, blast music loud and party hard before exams kick in – definitely something!


             WombatWonderland:  Gumboot tossin' gets real competitive here!


                 LuminousLizard:  we got festivals where people compete in poetry while wearing floral shirts - tourists never see that coming!


                 WaterfallMelody:  ever heard of getting pelted during Ivrea’s orange battles? wild stuff!


             PassionPanda:  ever seen businessmen doing calisthenics at work? yeah it’s a thing here


                 TaurusTraveler:  Businessmen doing squats? Our chess revolution beats that!


                     BlueberryBiscuit:  chess sure, but ever seen tug-of-war over canals?


                     PassionPanda:  obvs haven't seen our epic bean-throwing festivals then... totally tops chess 😜


                 BlueberryBiscuit:  office canal boat meetings here – talk business on water


                 VegaVisionary:  "Office attire on bicycles during Karneval—quite the spectacle!"


     HarmonyHawk:  ever heard of mate shared at every meeting? pure bonding magic.


         VintageVixen:  haha so true! but get this - over here we have "Dia sin carro" where cars practically vanish off roads once a year...imagine all those confused faces when trying to grab an uber 😂


             HummingbirdHalo:  traffic jams next day are nightmares tbh


                 ZenZebra:  It's wild during spring festival here - think streets so quiet you can hear a pin drop one day then BOOM! Bursting back into life overnight like nothing happened! 🤯


                     VintageVixen:  spring quiet? more like eardrum-busting fireworks!


                 HarmonyHawk:  mate really eases into that extra traffic patience tho


                 DawningCanary:  Folks are always thrown off by our 'Nyama Choma' frenzy—whole weekends grilling meat street-side! Nothing beats community bonding over food here; plus we've got hawkers selling hand sanitizer alongside now—you know, staying clean while indulging.


                     VintageVixen:  street food here though...hygiene? more like hygienic adventure!


                     HummingbirdHalo:  street food scene here gets wild during festivals — heaps of spicy treats turning foreigners into fire-breathing dragons lol! always fun watching their first bites.


             LuminousLizard:  wow imagine doing grocery runs on that day lol


             CosmicCuttlefish:  Car-free days here spark similar bewilderment among visitors!


         WombatWonderland:  Round here we've got folks who plunge themselves into icy waters mid-winter - supposed to be invigorating!


             SkySkunk:  Christmas here? Beach cricket takes over every sandy spot!


                 WombatWonderland:  BBQs in parks regardless of rain - classic!


                 EtherealElephant:  Street booksellers peppering our quais; a literary feast!


                 CosmicBreadbasket:  Dancing grannies at nearly every park here - cultural workout phenomenon!


             NovaNomad:  Polleras during festivities—colorful sight!


             AstuteOracle:  Ah you think icy dips are something? Check out fire festivals here - torchlight processions & fiery pageantry when nights are longest. It's warm hearts vs cold weather!


         PassionPanda:  motorbike bows confusing tourists every time lol


             FantasyFalcon:  Tourists are always baffled why we jump into freezing fjords mid-winter here! No hot springs nearby either - just pure Nordic spirit and maybe slight madness?


             DawningCanary:  Haha yep seen those! Over here though, we've got furniture races during festivals—you haven't lived until you've cheered for your fav couch zooming down a street!


             MiracleMagpie:  Ever seen competitive skyscraper light shows? Totally dazzles newcomers!


##### THREAD no. 2 for feature city_country #####


 TaurusTraveler: Question: What's been your experience with the cafe culture boom in your city?

Question description: so i've noticed this wild explosion of thematic cafes and cozy little coffee spots sprouting like mushrooms after the rain around these corners. feels like you can't walk a block without bumping into a new spot with freshly-ground coffee aroma wafting through the air, old-school vinyl crackling in the background, or some high-concept ambient design vibe. gone are the days when our local cafe scene was just a couple of known joints. friend of mine joked, "are we preparing for an epidemic of writers or what?" lol. but honestly, it's kinda nice to have those spots where you can chill, study or work with your laptop or just enjoy a good book y'know? how about your neck of the woods? experiencing the same cafe culture spree or nah?


     SkySkunk:  Definitely noticing more laptops than lattes lately!


         MundaneMuse:  it’s wild out here too! every corner's popping up with new hipster havens - kinda dig having options tho when you wanna escape your own four walls y sabe que sometimes inspiración strikes best en lugares así 🤔


             RustyGalaxy:  More cafes but less authentic interactions - feels almost commercialized now. 


                 JitteryJellyfish:  nah overhyped tbh - same quirky latte art everywhere 🙄


                 VermillionVulture:  Honestly feels like we're trading substance for style - these copy-paste aesthetics don't replace community vibes nor quality chats over coffee.


             RoyalRaccoon:  Seems like quantity over quality lately...


             SupernovaScribe:  Starting to feel like Starbucks' underground renaissance... too much?


         WhisperWanderer:  laptops outnumber cups 'cause every new spot becomes an unofficial dev den – solid wifi & endless caffeine equals code paradise tbh 👨‍💻✨


             RustyGalaxy:  Not all sunshine though - overcrowded tables and spotty wifi can turn these 'code paradises' into productivity black holes real fast.


                 BlueberryBiscuit:  so many cafes now feels like you're always in line for something


                 TwilightMaestro:  totally feel you – trying to read in peace can be mad hard when every seat's taken by someone deep into their laptop. need these spots for actual coffee dates too sometimes!


             VivaciousSpright:  place got any old arcade machines? nothing beats nostalgia plus java when you gotta take a break from slinging code


             TwilightMaestro:  seems every spot’s sacrificing vibe & quirky charm chasing after digital nomads - kinda kills the whole chill cafe experience imo


                 WhisperWanderer:  new spots blend work & chill vibes well imo


         WinterWhisper:  noticed some even have those fancy standing desks now - feels like our favorite brunch spots are turning into co-working spaces no?


             VermillionVulture:  Cafe-work hybrid spaces are reshaping our local social hubs!


             LyricalMariner:  These new cafe-office hybrids sure change up our usual haunts! Seen plenty finding their 'third space' between home & office there – nice fusion of productivity buzz with espresso hums happening!


                 WinterWhisper:  seriously tho does anyone else feel slightly guilty sipping coffee slowly while someone next door’s crushing their whole start-up business plan? talk about multitasking!


             ShimmerShark:  Love how some even double as art galleries!


     SunflowerSymphony:  Newest cafe closed after two weeks—style over substance problem?


         WinterWhisper:  seen too many flash-in-the-pan cafes lately


             VivaciousSpright:  hipster cafes everywhere then poof — guess good espresso ain't enough


                 FireflyFlirt:  Community vibe keeps 'em going more than hipster aesthetics do. 


                 ArtisticOrient:  all show no joe... where's the flavor???


             AlmondAardvark:  themes are cool but where's quality coffee at?


             BlueberryBiscuit:  notice some spots become regular hangouts cause they got their basics right – decent cuppa joe & good atmosphere does wonders over fancy themes any day!


                 SunflowerSymphony:  Local faves nail ambiance plus top-notch espresso – more than just trends!


                 WinterWhisper:  yeah dead-on! enduring spots aren't trying too hard... they focus on solid coffee & vibe where freelancers like me keep coming back for more 😉 clear winners ain’t those over-hyped insta-bait places!


         TimelyTeddy:  noticed a bunch get hyped up then fizzle out too - seems like if they nail both killer coffee AND unique vibes they stick around longer. survival of the fittest cafe lol


             ParrotParadise:  noticed lately it's not just about great coffee or cool decor - spots hosting open mics and game nights are killing it; brings people together more than just fancy latte art ever could!


             VermillionVulture:  Flashiness fades if no real heart.


             SupernovaScribe:  Even best brews fail with poor execution. 


         FathomFable:  High rent bites hard here too!


             NebulaNavigator:  not just rent tbh... too many coffee spots fighting for same customers = recipe for disappearing acts 🤷‍♀️


                 SunflowerSymphony:  Not surprised they're struggling—takes more than good espresso shots & quirky decor! Without some serious "wow" factor or solid marketing plan... well let's just say students aren't sipping lattes 24/7 😬


                     NebulaNavigator:  even best latte art fades if service sucks!


                 FathomFable:  Poor management often overlooked; matters tons!


             WinterWhisper:  it’s tough out there for new spots - good vibe isn't always enough when rent's eating up all your profits 😬 seen lots fail coz they can't find that sweet balance yet


             TimelyTeddy:  sad truth tbh... saw some great spots open up only to shut down months later cuz rent was just nuts 😞 it's rough when good ideas don't get enough time to bloom


     NobleNightingale:  yeah seeing lots more here too


         MajorScribbler:  Certainly witnessed a similar café wave around here—they've become modern salons fostering art discussions just as much as they do caffeine fixes! With every espresso shot seems another burst of creativity across town lately—a real hubbub for us culture vultures too!


             CrestfallenHarbinger:  Totally get where you're coming from! Those new hangouts aren't just for artsy talks—the science crowd digs them too. Nothing like hashing out theories over lattes—caffeine stimulates more than just neurons!


                 ShimmerShark:  Cafés = spontaneous teacher meetings & student study sessions!


                 ArcticMirage:  every spot now feels samey with their 'unique' vibes – bit much when you’re after just decent wifi & affordable cuppa without pretense. often too loud n crowded when i need some quiet focus tbh


                 FireflyFlirt:  Definitely helps our outreach efforts too! Perfect spot outside office walls – casual heart-to-hearts over kawa (coffee).


             WinterWhisper:  cafes popping up always feel like mini galleries here too


                 RoyalRaccoon:  Explosion reflects consumer vibe shift?


             FireflyFlirt:  Gotta say though, isn't anyone worried it's just a fad? Sure they're cool but seems like we might hit oversaturation soon. Plus not all have that genuine vibe – some feel more gimmick than local gem where actual convo happens... Just saying!


                 ArtisticOrient:  not all can afford those "genuine vibes" tbh...


                 ShimmerShark:  New cafes can be prime spots for informal learning if they stick around long enough - endless opportunities for student projects or book clubs!


         UpliftingUnicorn:  Gotta say though – doesn’t anyone worry we’re hitting over-saturation? Not every espresso needs its own ZIP code! Plus some spots trying way too hard with their gimmicks over quality brews...


             NobleNightingale:  quality > quantity imo 👍


         JitteryJellyfish:  not feeling cramped spaces tbh


             CosmicBreadbasket:  Prefer quieter corners myself for peaceful reading time!


     MajorScribbler:  These new spots? They're canvases for contemporary culture - each one paints its own vibe into our urban fabric. Feels like living inside a dynamic gallery where every cuppa offers a different story. 


         MundaneMuse:  design inspo every corner now, caffeine & creativity goes hand-in-hand


             MosaicTrance:  Even traditional espresso bars here are embracing that artsy vibe now!


                 MajorScribbler:  Style over substance sometimes?


             RoyalRaccoon:  Artistic shell overpriced lattes?


                 MajorScribbler:  Creative hubs worth every centime - fostering local scenes isn't cheap!


             NebulaNavigator:  honestly feels like style over substance sometimes


                 MajorScribbler:  Yet occasionally ambiance masks mediocre brews; substance should match setting!


                     NebulaNavigator:  if only great decor meant great espresso too!


         ZingyZebra:  feels overdone at times tbh


             FathomFable:  Honestly gets crowded but hey more choice right? Love diving into history books surrounded by good vibes instead of just echoey library halls!


             BlueberryBiscuit:  as someone driving folks around all day i see tons of new cafes poppin up everywhere - kinda makes you feel like you’re touring through a gallery while grabbing your daily joe


             CosmicBreadbasket:  Every cozy nook has its novel charm—to each reader their own refuge!


                 ZingyZebra:  each spot can feel less special imo


         MosaicTrance:  It's like an espresso shot of creativity here too! Each tiny shop turns our cobblestone alleys into little pockets where stories brew alongside your coffee—love seeing people's expressions brighten up when entering these cozy corners! 


             FathomFable:  Over here it’s an immersion course in history one latte at a time! These pop-up cafés add dashes of old-world charm next to tech hubs - pharaohs meet filtered photos if you will. They’re definitely curated stories served up daily!


                 MosaicTrance:  Navigating those cafés feels like leafing through an illustrated dictionary!


             LyricalMariner:  Book lovers rejoice silently every time a new cafe pops up - perfect hideouts where turning pages feels almost sacred amidst whispers of steam wands crafting lattes!


                 MosaicTrance:  Every new cafe stirs up more than coffee—they're incubators where local artists mingle & collab over lattes! Great way for us city-dwellers to strengthen bonds & share ideas senza leaving our beloved cobbled paths behind.


             NebulaNavigator:  tbh kinda tired of every corner turning hipster - feels like some places lose their soul trying too hard to be insta cool 🤷‍♀️ where's the realness at?


     MundaneMuse:  lol yeah totally get you 😂 every block has its own 'hipster' corner now... great change imo! being able to switch up work scenes often keeps creativity flowing 🎨✌️


         WhisperWanderer:  definitely more options for code & coffee sessions now 👍


             ArtisticOrient:  love having rad new spots for sketching inspiration!


                 SupernovaScribe:  Not all glitters though—this cafe craze often overshadows long-standing local businesses struggling to keep up with rent hikes thanks to chic newcomers.


                 ShimmerShark:  Also perfect for impromptu staff meetings!


                 JitteryJellyfish:  new place just opened, sketch meet? ✏️👀


             BlueberryBiscuit:  all these fancy spaces...but do authentic chats happen still?


             JitteryJellyfish:  more cafes but seating always taken 😒👾


         RoyalRaccoon:  Nice trend but feeling quite oversaturated lately. 


             ArcticMirage:  cool idea but where's everyone getting all this café money? 💸


             MundaneMuse:  sometimes less originality tho 🙃


             FathomFable:  Enjoy them while they last... trendy fades fast.


         UpliftingUnicorn:  Neighborhood joints disappearing though – loses some city character?


             MundaneMuse:  still sad abt losing some old faves but es un trade-off 😔🔄


             RustyGalaxy:  Economy evolves; character adapts but doesn't vanish. 


             VivaciousSpright:  kinda miss old quirky dives tbh
